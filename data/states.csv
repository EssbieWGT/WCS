In the absence of federal funding and support, municipalities feel added challenges on their paths to net zero but many chug along with the state’s help in projects to decarbonize buildings, municipal fleets, and put up solar arrays. 
The post How these Massachusetts communities are pushing forward to meet state climate goals  appeared first on CommonWealth[...]","Around 3pm in the afternoon on a Monday, not long after school was dismissed, about forty kids were running around the playground and under the large solar panel awning over the parking lot next to Hosmer Elementary School in Watertown. There were electric vehicle chargers spaced out in the parking lot and a box sat in the back of the school containing battery storage. Out of the windows in one of the science classrooms, parts of the roof are visible and solar arrays line every free square foot. Inside the school, there is a constant hum of fresh air circulating, and the walls of the hallways are decorated with brightly colored infographics that lay out facts about the school’s green features. One reads: “1920 photovoltaic solar panels are located on the school property, which generate close to 800 kWh of energy.”  Hallway in Hosmer Elementary School with infographics about the school.

The school, which has been open for about three years, consumes no more energy than it produces from the solar arrays on its roofs and over its parking lots.  Jess Donato, a third-grade teacher whose children attend Hosmer, said that the building makes the students more conscious of the climate and the environment. Her oldest son, who is now in middle school, still talks about how the school helped him learn to think about the environment and green solutions. He started thinking about “how much energy is being used, and different ideas like solar panels over parking lots. [He asked] why every school isn’t doing this? To him it seems so obvious,” Donato said. Teachers at Watertown’s net-zero Hosmer Elementary School.

(Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria)The city is in the process of building yet another net-zero school — this time a high school that is going to incorporate geothermal energy along with solar panels. The high school is set to be built to LEED Platinum 4.0 standards — one of the highest certifications a building can receive for energy efficiency and sustainability. According to Watertown officials, it will be the first high school building in the country to both be net zero and LEED Platinum certified.  Watertown isn’t the only municipality in Massachusetts taking steps — and allocating scarce budget resources — to combat climate change. Cities and towns across state are funding programs to decarbonize their buildings, their municipal fleets, their schools, and contribute to the state’s climate goals. As the average global temperature rises, storms intensify, and droughts disrupt food production — and the federal government rolls back decades of climate policy — there is an added spotlight on these efforts as a way for decarbonization to continue in the state. “We can keep moving forward at the municipal level,” said Amy Boyd, the vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the Environmental Justice League of Massachusetts. “Municipal leaders can be responsive to their community’s concerns and desires to face the climate crisis head on and be ready and do what we can to protect our communities from the worst of it even if at the federal level, they’re rolling back such protections.” But most towns and cities — especially in the absence of a federal partner — remain reliant on the state to make major changes, and the state tends to move at a slow pace.  Massachusetts is a leader in climate policies, but environmentalists say that the state can do more to support municipalities in their efforts to decarbonize. The scale of the funding that the state can provide is much lower than what the federal government can. But as the Trump administration freezes funding for climate initiatives, lays off workers at the Environmental Protection Agency, and stymies offshore wind, the state will have to step in to decide what programs it can fund and what projects must be put on the chopping block.  Solar panels over library parking lot in Newton. (Photo by Laura Colarusso)Watertown, which was one of the first communities in New England to pass an ordinance requiring solar panels on most new buildings larger than 10,000 square feet or containing 10 or more residential units, has been committed to mirroring the state goal of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050. The city has a committee dedicated to environment and energy efficiency that works on pushing for green policies.  “Any city has to decide where they want to put [their] money,” said Jocelyn Tager, a resident of Watertown who has led the push for the city to invest in solar energy. “Some other school could spend $6 million on some fancy gym. And we spent it on solar arrays.” In 2017, the city had three elementary schools that needed to be replaced or renovated. Hosmer and Cuniff elementary schools were rebuilt as net-zero buildings. The third — Lowell School — was upgraded to be more energy efficient. These three projects cost about $170 million and were entirely funded through the city’s budget.  The new high school will cost about $220 million, most of which will be funded by the city, though the Massachusetts School Building Authority will kick in $50 million. The school, set to open in 2026, will serve just under 800 students. The under-construction new Watertown High School which will have solar panels and geothermal on site. (Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria)“We have found … that it is a lot easier to convince a small group of local people that this is good thing to do — that our environment is important to us — than it is to convince the state to do something,” said Pat Rathbone, a member of Watertown’s environmental and energy committee. “Massachusetts has very good climate goals, and Massachusetts will do its best to meet them. But this is the kind of thing that you could do in a state … less progressive than Massachusetts. Every single town is able to take a step like this, and our town is enormously proud of these schools.”  Tager emphasized that Watertown isn’t a rich community in comparison to its neighbors but that it has still been able to achieve this major step.  Danvers, a town located in Essex County which has its own municipal-owned electric company, has a project underway to build solar arrays on top of an existing landfill. The system is expected to generate around 3,200 megawatt hours of energy per year — enough to power roughly 1,000 homes and reduce carbon emissions by 2.7 million pounds. The solar arrays are set to be installed sometime in the next two years, and the entire project is estimated to cost the town around $3.6 million.    In the northwestern corner of the state, Williamstown — which is home to Williams College — is building its new fire station with the aim of making it a net-zero carbon facility with onsite solar panels. It’s a part of the town’s goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In Newton, there are solar arrays operating at 19 city-owned parking lots, building rooftops, and a landfill. The city has a plan to add nine more by the end of 2026. Once the new arrays come online, 40 percent of the total electricity municipal buildings use will come from solar. Most of the planned projects will put solar arrays at public schools around the city on roofs and over parking lots.  Newton has pursued several other initiatives like converting its municipal fleet to electric vehicles as of 2022. As of this year, the city has 68 electric vehicles in its fleet program supporting 21 departments.   “Local government efforts in climate action are extremely important right now,” said Caroline Weiss, the climate action coordinator in Newton. “It’s important to continue to work on climate action in times where that’s not happening everywhere in this country. That really can still make a difference and empower residents.” Many towns choose to pursue climate initiatives not just because they are good for the environment but because they save money. Watertown owns the solar arrays on the schools, which means that the city has a locked-in cost of electricity and is therefore not subject to fluctuations in natural gas prices.  “Putting solar panels on a parking lot or on the roof [of a] school saves money for the town,” said Boyd. “That’s not an investment that’s being made just out of altruism or, love for the earth. It’s actually a good fiscal decision that saves money on the town’s power bills, which can then be spent on more books, more police officers, or whatever else the town needs to do.”  Solar arrays over Hosmer Elementary School’s parking lot. (Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria)Towns and cities face tradeoffs when choosing to invest in climate initiatives because they often finance projects through their tax base, leaving less money for other priorities as inflation and the uncertainty around tariffs raise costs. And unlike the federal government, local governments can’t run a deficit to make ends meet. In Marblehead, a community on the North Shore, community leaders are also trying to decarbonize municipal buildings but face budget constraints.  In the town, residents have been frustrated that the restrooms have been closed down seasonally due to failing heating equipment. The town has chosen a climate-friendly way to solve this problem: install a heat pump system for the restrooms. The project used money from American Rescue Plan Act funding to put in the heat pump. But other climate projects are difficult for the town to afford. Marblehead has struggled to find the funds for a $13.8 million project to replace the deteriorating seawalls that protect the town from erosion and flooding, both of which are intensifying because of climate change. Town officials were counting on a federal PROTECT grant to fund the project, but that program was canceled. They’re pursuing another federal grant, but there is still uncertainty there on whether the town will get funding. It’s difficult to do climate initiatives with just town funds, according to Logan Casey, the town’s sustainability coordinator.  “Municipalities [are] cash-strapped, and that is very much the situation in Marblehead,” said Casey. “[For] a lot of other municipalities in Massachusetts there isn’t a lot of free cash just flying around ready to pick up for any capital project that you can imagine.” Federal and state funds are crucial to helping the town move forward on its climate goals, Casey added. Massachusetts’ Green Communities Grant program, established through a 2008 law, provides funding to municipalities that want to reduce municipal energy use and costs through clean energy projects. Municipalities must first be designated as a “green community” and pledge to cut municipal energy use by 20 percent over five years, support renewable energy, and promote energy efficiency in municipal buildings and transportation to qualify for the program.  Since 2010, the program has awarded more than $191 million for projects like installing high-efficiency lighting, upgrading energy management systems, and transitioning HVAC systems away from fossil fuels. In March 2025 alone, the state gave more than $7.2 million to cities and towns across Massachusetts to fund clean energy projects. Newton has received a total of $2.2 million in Green Communities grants since 2010 for projects like weatherizing public buildings and installing heat pumps. Weiss said that Green Communities and Mass Save, the state’s energy efficiency program for residential and commercial properties, are some of the biggest drivers of decarbonization in Newton. (Mass Save also offers rebates for converting HVAC systems and appliances to clean energy.)  State programs allow decarbonization to happen on a larger scale than a single community could afford, said Boyd “Larger towns that are able to have a sustainability professional on staff are going to be able to move farther and faster than towns that that can’t afford to have somebody whose whole job is focused on that,” said Boyd. “But every town [can decarbonize] if we can help them with state policies and provide some of the upfront funding … to get over the initial hump of the upfront cost of investment.” Michael Barrett, the Senate chair of the Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy Committee, emphasized the importance of the state providing financial backing to local projects that provide outreach to residents about utilizing the Mass Save program or state funding to decarbonize at the individual level. “There are all kinds of local activities for example that involve nonprofit, volunteer coaching in which somebody retired perhaps from a regular day job, but smart about heat pumps or solar panels participate in a community backed effort to offer advice to residents of the community that want to do the same thing,” said Barrett. “The reason that so many of these programs are appealing to state officials like me is that you get a lot of bang for your buck. [It is a] human capital extender — the effort is being expended by local volunteers with the help of a compensated coordinator or two.” One such program is the PlugIn program, a partnership between Acton, Ashland, Natick, Sudbury, Wayland, Westborough, and Framingham to do outreach to individual households on how to shift away from fossil fuels and transition to electrification. The program focuses on rooftop solar, community solar, and heat pumps. The program is run by the non-profit MassEnergize and has received funding from the Legislature.  Legislators set aside money in the state’s budget for programs like these to help municipalities. However, the environmental community argues that the state can do more to support municipalities in their efforts to decarbonize — especially for environmental justice communities that lack resources — in the absence of federal support. “Municipalities do not have the tools to raise the kind of revenue that they need to do a transition to a clean energy economy,” said Vickash Mohanka, head of the Massachusetts Sierra Club. “We can see that through energy efficiency and Mass Save program. If towns and small cities had to fund their own version of Mass Save, we wouldn’t have any energy efficiency in the state basically. It would be extremely difficult…So having the state step in is a necessary tool.”  Municipally-owned cars in Newton charging in the Newton City Hall parking lot. (Photo by Laura Colarusso)Local governments aren’t just limited by their lack of funds. In some cases, they require approval from the Legislature to take steps to decarbonize. For example, municipalities cannot adopt an ordinance that requires all new buildings or major renovation projects to be fossil fuel-free unless the Legislature approves it. This is a policy that many towns and cities across Massachusetts have wanted to adopt, but the state does not allow municipalities to regulate or restrict the use of fossil fuels in construction.  In 2022, the Legislature launched a pilot program that allows up to 10 communities to adopt such a policy. The communities are: Arlington, Newton, Acton, Aquinnah, Brookline, Cambridge, Concord, Lincoln, Lexington, and Northampton. The program is supposed to serve as a demonstration program for a fossil-fuel free mandate for new buildings.  The roll out has been slow for the program with communities getting approved nearly two years after the law passed. There are many communities including Salem, Boston, and Somerville that wanted to be a part of the program but couldn’t. Environmentalists say that the pilot program needs to be expanded. “The Legislature must act with urgency to facilitate the expansion of this program and allow an equitable adoption of this opt-in program so that more diverse communities are able to achieve cleaner air quality, along with lower construction and operational building costs,” said Lisa Cunningham, a co-founder of advocacy group ZeroCarbonMA. Municipalities have led the push on adopting strict emissions reduction standards for existing larger buildings through “BERDO,” or the Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure initiative. The policy sets declining emissions standards for larger buildings and sets fines for buildings that don’t comply.   Boston, Cambridge, and Newton have all adopted versions of BERDO with their own schedules for compliance. For Boston, the first compliance window began in 2025, and the city has created a fund aimed at supporting projects to reduce building emissions, especially for “communities disproportionately impacted by air pollution.” Watertown is in the process of drafting a BERDO ordinance. According to Boyd, communities like Boston adopting BERDO can serve as an example of a success story that other communities and the state can learn from. But outside of ordinances like BERDO, the energy profile of buildings is still largely regulated through state standards.  “There are other ways besides grants that state aid is hugely helpful to municipalities,” said Ann Berwick, the co-director of climate and sustainability in Newton. “Cities and towns can’t adopt their own building codes. So the state plays an important role in promulgating progressive building codes.” Another way that towns and cities have sought to green their energy portfolios is by setting up municipal aggregation programs. A municipality can negotiate a competitive rate for electricity pricing on behalf of the residents and businesses within a community and they can set how much of the energy mix is provided by renewable sources. These arrangements have been around in the state since 2000, but more recently, municipalities have begun to choose increasing amounts of renewable energy content. There are 199 municipal aggregation programs with around 1.27 million customers enrolled in them across the state, as of January 2024. The biggest one is in Boston where residents are automatically enrolled in a program that has 42 percent renewable energy unless they opt out. (Newton, for example, has a much higher base option of 95 percent renewables in which residents are automatically enrolled.) The cost of electricity through the Boston program is currently higher than the rate offered by the local utility company but given the fluctuations in fossil fuel-based energy, there are times when the negotiated price is lower than the rate offered by the utility company. The Department of Public Utilities is tasked with approving each municipal aggregation program and that has led to years-long delays for municipalities seeking approval. The state has made the approval process easier by creating a template and guidelines for municipalities to follow. That has reduced the delay significantly, according to Larry Chretien, executive director of the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance.  The country is entering a new era of federal climate policy where funding for decarbonization and mitigation programs is being frozen as the Trump administration rolls back state-level rules and other protections designed to avoid the worst of climate change.  Towns and cities are doing the best they can to decarbonize but they are looking to the state for more funding, more guidance, and more permission to be aggressive in their climate goals. The state’s climate chief, Melissa Hoffer, emphasized that a partnership between communities and the state will be crucial to meet the current moment.  “It’s not only important to think about individual projects in municipalities, but to think about how [we] can coordinate efforts across districts,” said Hoffer. “Instead of one-off projects and one-off planning, how can we coordinate that to address that risk and better coordinate the capital that is available…We’re in a capital-constrained environment now.” The question on many environmentalists’ minds is whether the Legislature will meet the moment.  “The [Massachusetts] Legislature definitely is [slow],” said Gandbhir. “I appreciate all the work that they’ve done so far, but there’s definitely a need of a jump start. There’s a lack of transparency with the Legislature and… that can really cause a loss of perspective and a loss of sight over what we really need to accomplish. There’s a lot that needs to be done moving forward, and we do really need to pick up the pace.” Sen. Jamie Eldridge, who sponsored the funding for the PlugIn program and has pushed for drought management policies and a plastic bag ban, said the Legislature can do more for municipalities. “The state certainly needs to step up and we need to pass a very robust climate bill, perhaps [with] more state incentives for electric vehicles, battery storage, [and] solar panels,” said Eldridge. “What are we doing to make it easier to put up solar, given the Trump administration’s hostility to offshore wind?” Eldridge is pushing this session for a bill that would create a climate change superfund that would collect money from companies that are responsible for the more greenhouse gas emissions to fund resilience and adaptation projects in communities that are most impacted by climate change. “It’s reasonable whether it’s going after multinational corporations or finding some progressive tax to find a dedicated revenue source to do climate projects, whether it’s energy efficiency, solar, geothermal [or to] help communities hire sustainability managers,” Eldridge said.  Barrett, the state senator from Lexington, added a note of hope for local efforts even in the face of federal hostility to climate policies. “When it comes to climate initiatives, Trump is torching the field,” said Barrett. “He is riding roughshod over the crop and really putting it to ruin, but he’s not really destroying the root system of the climate movement. We’ve got lots of local activists with [some] state and local government help available to preserve the … climate movements — the root system. We can keep things healthy and going even though he’s doing a lot of damage on the surface. … The more localized climate action is, the less likely is it that Trump can reach it and damage it.” The post How these Massachusetts communities are pushing forward to meet state climate goals  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HosmerOutFront-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 12:21:00.334084

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Lawmakers gave wide final approval Wednesday to two measures designed to shrink the state’s looming budget deficit by $136 million.
The two bills are Legislative Bill 650, from State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, related to trimming business incentives, and LB 645, from State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, related to scaling back school retirement contributions based on how well funded the pension plan is. 
LB 650 passed 40-7. LB 645 passed 45-2.
Tax incentives pared back
LB 650 from von Gillern, who chairs the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, would reduce or defund various tax incentives with savings this biennium, including:

Buyer-based exemption for construction contractors to purchase materials tax-free if appointed to do so by a client ($12.9 million).
Credit for retailers collecting sales taxes (reduced, $11.7 million savings).
Renewable Chemical Production Tax Credit Act for local businesses producing renewable chemicals (defunded after 2025, $8.5 million savings).
Nebraska Relocation Incentive Act offering tax incentives for relocation expenses (reduced, $8 million savings).
Nebraska Advantage Rural Development Act for individuals or companies that increase economic activities intended to benefit rural Nebraska (reduced, $6.8 million savings).
Nebraska Biodiesel Tax Credit Act for retail dealers who sell and dispense biodiesel at a taxpayer’s retail gas station (reduced, $1 million savings).
Creating High Impact Economic Futures (CHIEF) Act for charitable contributions to community assistance or services helping to alleviate areas of chronic economic distress (defunded after 2025, $900,000 savings).
Nebraska Shortline Rail Modernization Act to offset railroad infrastructure maintenance and capital improvements for Class III railroads (reduced, $500,000 savings).
Food donation income tax credit for grocery stores, restaurants or agricultural producers that donate food to a food bank, food pantry or food rescue (defunded after 2025, $500,000 savings).
Cast and Crew Nebraska Act for qualifying film companies, productions and actors (defunded after 2025, $500,000 savings).
Reverse Osmosis System Tax Credit Act for the one-time installation of a reverse osmosis system at a taxpayer’s primary residence (reduced, $250,000 savings).
Urban Redevelopment Act designed to grow small businesses and generate investment in Nebraska’s urban cores (defunded after 2025, $101,000 savings).

School retirement changes
LB 645 from Ballard, who chairs the Legislature’s Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee, would reduce annual contributions to the state’s school retirement pension plan — for all employees outside Omaha Public Schools, who have a separate retirement plan — depending on the actuarial funding level of the pension plan. The school plan is currently 99.91% funded.
The state currently gives 2% of statewide payroll for employees covered under the plan. School employees contribute 9.78% of their monthly payroll, while school districts match that at 9.88% of the eligible employees in their district.
  The following represents the scaling retirement contribution rates that would be in place under an amended LB 645 proposed by State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln. (Courtesy of Sen. Beau Ballard)
Under the amended LB 645, contribution rates would change each July 1 for all three groups depending on whether the plan is:

Less than 96% funded (employees 9.75%, employers 9.85%, state 2%).
Between 96% and 98% funded (employees 8.75%, employers 8.84%, state 0.7%).
Between 98% and 100% funded (employees 8%, employers 8.08%, state 0.7%).
100% funded or more (employees 7.25%, employers 7.32%, state 0%).

Multiple senators said the tiered system could offer a “cushion” in hard economic times. 
Teachers and other school employees could see an immediate take-home pay increase, and school districts could have a property tax reduction. However, if the plan’s funding level falls, closing the gap would fall back to the state, employees and school districts.
Ballard, at the urging of State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, earlier this week put in language to LB 645 protecting the state’s continued contributions of 2% of payroll for Omaha Public Schools employees to the separate district retirement plan each year. That amendment also said it isn’t the Legislature’s intent to pick up “any financial responsibility or liability” for the OPS pension, which the state now manages.
Budget impacts
With the passage of LB 650 and LB 645, and with Gov. Jim Pillen’s expected support — he included both measures in his January budget proposal — the state’s projected budget deficit would fall by $136 million. The state also would save $187.24 million in the following two-year budget cycle, based on current projections.
Lawmakers still would need to find $259.4 million over the next two weeks to balance the budget and meet a statutorily required reserve limit, according to estimates from the Legislative Fiscal Office.

Green, R-Tenn., wrote in a statement that GOP lawmakers on the panel ""advanced funding to give Border Patrol agents the tools they have long requested to accomplish their homeland security mission in the field while protecting our communities.”“Conversely, the actions of our colleagues across the aisle today proved what the American people have known for some time,” Green wrote. “Democrats would rather advocate for a radical, open-borders agenda than for the safety of their own constituents, or the CBP personnel who suffered through a historic border crisis under the Biden-Harris administration.”The panel voted 18-14 along party lines to approve the bill. Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., wrote in a statement after his panel approved its bill that the measures ""not only would save taxpayers over $350 billion but also bring much-needed reform in three key areas: simplified loan repayment, streamlined student loan options, and accountability for students and taxpayers.""""I’m proud of the Committee’s work today to finally stand up and end the status quo of endless borrowing,” Walberg wrote.That panel voted 21-14 along party lines to approve its bill.House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., wrote the defense funding increase would ensure “that our national defense remains the strongest in the world and supports an agile and modern fighting force.”That committee voted 35-21 to advance its bill, with five Democrats — Don Davis of North Carolina, Jared Golden of Maine, Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico, Eugene Vindman of Virginia and George Whitesides of California — voting with all committee Republicans in favor.House committees are expected to release bills next week showing how Republicans plan to extend the 2017 GOP tax law as well as how they plan to cut federal funding on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, program.",,,,2025-04-30 12:21:00.334084

(Getty Images)Voters in Morgantown have narrowly rejected repealing an ordinance prohibiting homeless people from sleeping on the streets and in other public areas. 
The city voted 982 to 904 Tuesday in favor of not repealing the camping ban. The election results are unofficial until a canvas takes place May 5, the city said in a news release. 
The law, which is so far not yet in effect, prohibits camping on any public property — including streets, parks and trails — and also prohibits storing personal property in public areas. Second and third violations of the law are punishable by fines of $200 and $300 and/or 30 days in jail, respectively.
Council passed the ordinance in September. After that, the Morgantown Coalition for Housing Action successfully petitioned to have it repealed or put on the ballot. Council chose to put it on the ballot rather than repealing it. 
Proponents of the law have said homeless people sleeping in public areas is a health and safety issue.
Councilwoman Louise “Weez” Michael, who proposed the ordinance, said in a statement Wednesday she appreciates the trust of the community placed in council by supporting the ordinance. 
“This decision reflects our dedication to maintaining public safety and enhancing the quality of life for all residents,” she said. “We remain committed to working collaboratively with various stakeholders to ensure that our policies are effective and compassionate, addressing the needs of both our unsheltered population and the broader community.”
Opponents of the laws say camping bans do nothing to address the causes of homelessness and can make it worse by imposing fines and criminal penalties that make it harder for people to get into housing. 
They also point out that the city does not have enough resources for homeless people who want shelter. Morgantown has 54 year-round emergency shelter beds and another 21 beds when the winter shelter is open — not enough to accommodate the 100 homeless people identified during the 2024 point in time count. 
Councilman Brian Butcher, a homeless service provider, said Wednesday he’s very disappointed in the election results.
“[I’m] hopeful that the folks who said that this would spur them to create more resources actually do that now,” he said in a text message. 
Dozens of cities around the country have prohibited public camping after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a similar camping ban in Grants Pass, Oregon, amid record levels of homelessness. 
During the most recent legislative session, Del. Geno Chiarelli, a Republican who represents Monongolia County, introduced a bill that would have implemented a camping ban statewide. The bill passed in the House of Delegates but not in the Senate. 
“I was pleased, but not surprised to see Morgantown voters spoke at the ballot box yesterday to maintain a ban on individuals using our public property as camp sites,” Chiarelli said in a statement Wednesday. “I know this is an important safety issue in other parts of the state, which is why I plan to introduce my bill to ban urban camping again next year during the regular legislative session.”

When he called his dad and told him he was on suicide watch, his father started to cry.
During a previous facility inspection, a licensing specialist from the Louisiana Office of Juvenile Justice (OJJ) reported that the jail failed to “identify youth who may be at risk of suicide or who may need prompt mental health services.”
OJJ licensing specialists visited the jail multiple times between July and February and found the facility violated state regulations 83 times. The Appeal also received reports for an additional 11 juvenile detention facilities inspected during the same period. Jackson Parish had more violations than the combined total of those facilities and almost 12 times more than the second-worst lock-up.
The Jackson Parish Sheriff’s Office and the Office of Juvenile Justice did not answer a list of questions sent by The Appeal.

Inspectors detailed numerous violations of the kids’ rights. In February, an OJJ inspector reported that the Jackson Parish Jail “failed to ensure the youth are available for the minimum minutes in a school day as required by law.”
During multiple visits, specialists observed that the young people had no privacy when using the bathroom.
“Based upon observations, the provider’s bathroom facilities are not designed to allow youth to shower and/or perform bodily functions without others viewing them naked,” an OJJ specialist wrote in a February report. At the time, the jail held 20 young people. Their ages were not listed.
In another report, a specialist wrote that “a youth was observed on the toilet using the restroom in full view of other youth.”

Since 2022, civil rights attorneys have fought a protracted legal battle to ensure incarcerated kids receive the services they’re entitled to in a supportive environment. That year, the state announced it would send children to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, better known as Angola. A federal judge allowed the transfers to proceed, ruling that the unit is “therapeutic and rehabilitative while maintaining discipline, safety, and security,” in line with OJJ’s “rehabilitative, not punitive, mission.”
But after that judge visited the prison a year later, she ordered all children removed from Angola, finding that they ​​“are being victimized, traumatized, and seriously and irreparably harmed.” State officials moved the kids to the Jackson Parish Jail. Since then, children at the jail have said that they’ve been held in solitary confinement, sprayed with mace, shot with pepper balls, and denied educational and therapeutic services.
In November, OJJ terminated its contract with the Jackson Parish Sheriff’s Office, but the facility continues to hold kids. Invoices show that the agency paid the sheriff’s office more than $82,000 and over $86,000 for “juvenile housing” for December 2024 and January 2025, respectively. OJJ was billed more than $47,000 for March’s “juvenile housing.”
OJJ’s inspection reports echo many of the same issues documented by the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services, which visited the jail last April. As of July 1, 2024, OJJ became responsible for regulating and licensing juvenile detention facilities.
Although federal law requires that carceral facilities separate juveniles and adults by both sight and sound, an OJJ inspector reported in July that two adult detainees were housed in a room that was licensed to house children. The inspector did not specify if kids were also present. However, multiple young people have told the court that they frequently encounter adult detainees.
“The guards, who all wear sheriff deputy uniforms, did not keep me safe when I arrived here,” one child said in a January statement. “I was jumped by other kids thirteen (13) times, and once I was beaten up by guards.”
He says guards maced him seven or eight times.
“The mace really stings,” he said.

OJJ investigators found that the Jackson Parish Jail improperly handled suicide attempts that occurred in September and October.
According to a report on the September attempt, video shows a young person tying a ligature while an officer sat at a desk. About seven minutes later, the youth attempted to harm himself. The officer then radioed for assistance.
“[OJJ] [s]pecialists observed very little to no movement by staff during this time,” the investigator wrote. “Staff members must be moving around. The bunks are a critical issue and need to be addressed immediately to avoid any more attempts of suicide.”
The young person was placed on suicide watch. But, from Sept. 9 to Sept. 17, jail staff missed over 50 scheduled checks, which must occur every 15 minutes.
The OJJ specialist interviewed staff members who had spoken with the youth: three counselors, a nursing assistant, and several corrections officers. A counselor reported that the young person should speak with a psychiatrist, but documents do not indicate that he ever did.
One of the counselors told the OJJ specialist that only the nurse practitioner could take the young person off suicide watch.
In violation of state regulations, the jail also failed to report the suicide attempt to the “parent/legal guardian, defense counsel, and judge of record.”
Another report details an Oct. 30 suicide attempt, but it’s unclear if it involved the same person who attempted suicide in September.
In the October case, the report says jail staff failed to properly monitor the youth.
“Based upon record review, the level of mental health supervision provided to C-1 [the youth] was not determined by a qualified mental health professional,” the OJJ specialist wrote. “Provider failed to provide current policy for Suicide Management and Prevention.”
Instead of conducting in-person suicide watch checks, the report says jail staff monitored the young person using cameras—yet another violation of state regulations. On nine separate occasions, staff did not conduct the required 15-minute checks.

The reports also detail abuse by employees. During a five-week period from August to September, staff sprayed kids with a “chemical agent” at least 15 times, sometimes multiple times a day. After one incident, the staff failed to obtain immediate medical follow-ups for two young people. Specialists also found that the jail violated the required staff-to-youth ratio of 1 to 8. On one occasion, the specialist observed one staff member supervising 15 youth.
In a January inspection report, an OJJ specialist said he viewed footage of a jailer using a “chemical agent” against a youth. Although a “medical professional” told the specialist that he had “conducted an assessment” of the victim, there was no documentation that any examination had occurred.
The specialist viewed a video of another attack that occurred on the same day. In that case, two staffers used “a type of intervention on a youth that was not an approved physical escort technique, physical restraint, or mechanical restraint device.” The investigator said the detainee was removed “in a seated position,” and that the restraint techniques were “disproportionate to the actions and behavior” the youth exhibited. The specialist said the youth was not threatening themselves or others.
The two staff members “each had an arm extended above [the victim’s] head and behind his back,” and “were walking out of the room while dragging [the victim] out by the arms.”
After reviewing the inspection reports provided by The Appeal, David Utter, a member of the kids’ legal team, said that two state agencies have “found the jail to be severely lacking in the most basic treatment and rehabilitative and educational programs.”
Utter said that decades of research show that subjecting children to these types of conditions has catastrophic consequences.
“Kids do better when they’re home,” he told The Appeal. “Kids do better when we wrap services around them in their community. But Louisiana keeps on sending children to these punitive environments in the face of proven justice policy.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/jackson-parish-sheriffs-office-hq-png-1024x813.webp,,,2025-04-30 12:21:00.334084

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Coloradans’ trash negatively affects our health after going to landfills. How? Trash, especially food and yard waste, creates large amounts of invisible air pollution in the form of gases. This air pollution contains methane that negatively impacts our climate and toxic air pollutants like benzene and hydrogen sulfide that can make people sick. Coloradans living closest to landfills suffer the worst effects. All of us experience harm from landfill air pollution no matter where we live.
To help address this problem, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment recently proposed a Landfill Methane Rule to the Air Quality Control Commission. The rule’s purpose is to reduce the landfill gases that harm our bodies, our air, and our environment.
This rule would provide highly effective and economical ways to collect and reduce landfill air pollution. Biocovers and biofilters, which use bacteria to break down the gases, are one approach included in the proposed rule. Collecting the gases then burning them inside a closed structure (called enclosed flaring) is another. For either method to work well, highly accurate measurement of the amount of gases released from landfills is necessary to make sure landfill gases are being optimally reduced.
While biocovers and biofilters work well to reduce landfill gases, they are not enough to handle the overall amount of air pollution created by landfills. In order to meet our climate goals and protect public health, landfills will have to collect and burn landfill gases or put them to beneficial use (for instance, using landfill gases to generate energy).
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When I first learned the rule allows enclosed flaring as a method of pollution control, I was alarmed. I pictured oil and gas operations burning unwanted gases in highly polluting and inefficient open flames (called open flaring), a process that has serious impacts on our health. The proposed rule requires new landfill flares to be enclosed and existing open flares at landfills to be phased out by 2029. Enclosed flaring is a tightly controlled process that eliminates 98% to 99% of gases collected from a landfill.
Enclosed flaring is different from open flaring because an enclosed flare burns almost all of the gases collected and can be tested to make sure pollution reduction targets are being met. Unfortunately, some particulate air pollution is created during enclosed flaring (called combustion products), but enclosed flaring removes much more air pollution than it creates. As such, enclosed flaring is a needed tool to decrease the harm landfill gases cause to our health and environment.
While enclosed flaring is necessary, the public must be protected from combustion products created by the process. The combustion products released by enclosed flaring can be closely monitored and accurately measured. The proposed Landfill Methane Rule requires such monitoring and also requires that any pollution created by enclosed flaring meet air quality standards. In order to minimize the potential harms of enclosed flaring, air quality standards and the proposed monitoring processes must be rigorously enforced.
As a physician, I care a lot about the negative impacts of air pollution on our well-being. The best way to prevent landfill air pollution is to reduce the amount of food and yard waste going into landfills. We also must address the ongoing current air pollution from landfills. CDPHE’s proposed Landfill Methane Rule creates some of the strongest requirements in the country for reducing landfill air pollution.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states, including South Dakota, have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
Education board votes to finalize embrace of phonics-based reading instruction for South Dakota

In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
‘It’s the system that needs fixing’
Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law Monday.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
Federal education cuts and Trump DEI demands leave states, teachers in limbo

The new law requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
Opposition to ‘science of reading’
Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.










A student's likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute


In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

Shelley Moore Capito. (Getty Images)
At least some workers at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health are getting back to work this week after federal cuts in early April took them off the job, according to a statement released Tuesday by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.
Those returning to work include some employees from the Coal Worker Health Surveillance Program and the Fire Fighters’ Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program. The total number of individuals who were granted reemployment has not been released.
And those who are returning to work will, at this time, only be doing so temporarily.
A Reduction In Force for the “vital” federal agency is still slated to go into effect in June and will impact these workers, according to a statement from the local chapter of the American Federation of Governmental Employees, a labor union representing the employees.
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of AFGE Local 3430 in Morgantown, said in a news release that the union is “encouraged” by the decision to call crucial workers back to work.
“This action, though temporary, allows these dedicated professionals to return to their critical roles in advancing worker safety and health across the country,” Tinney-Zara said. “Their return means renewed momentum for life-saving research, outreach and interventions that protect workers in high-risk industries and help prevent illness, injury, and death on the job.”
Notably, Tinney-Zara continued, it seems only workers in the CWHSP and the FFFIPP — programs that are “currently in the media spotlight” — were included in the calls to return to work. That leaves numerous other programs and initiatives undertaken by NIOSH still inoperable after cuts from the new federal Department of Government Efficiency hit the agency in early April.
“These are undoubtedly vital initiatives, but they are only a portion of the comprehensive, nationwide worker protection mission NIOSH fulfills,” Tinney-Zara said. “From construction sites to health care facilities, from transportation hubs to agricultural fields, NIOSH’s work touches nearly every corner of the American labor force.”
The directive offering some people their jobs back came after Capito, earlier this month, wrote a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging him to reconsider the cuts that cost at least 200 people their jobs — and, in turn, ended the programs they worked for — in the Morgantown NIOSH facility.
On Tuesday, Capito said in a statement that she was “encouraged that some NIOSH functions for coal miner and firefighter safety are slated to resume with some select staff returning to work this week.”
“But my understanding is that this is temporary so my focus will continue to be on working with [the federal Department of Health and Human Services] on permanently restoring these functions and personnel in the most efficient and effective manner,” Capito continued.
In her letter to Kennedy on April 21, Capito emphasized how critical Morgantown’s NIOSH facility and the workers within it were to combatting deadly black lung disease and protecting miners who are now being pushed, through initiatives by the Trump Administration, to mine more coal than any time in recent memory.
“The NIOSH Mining Program works to eliminate mining fatalities and injuries. Research in rock dust has resulted in safety changes to prevent explosions in underground mines …” Capito wrote. “NIOSH’s [CWHSP] studies respiratory disease and provides black lung screenings to coal miners. It is my understanding that the RIF impacted every employee in these important programs.”
With work by the CWHSP halted since April 1, coal miners in central Appalachia have been without access to critical health services and surveillance, including free screeningsfor black lung and a program that allows them, once diagnosed with black lung, to request relocating to a different, less dusty portion of a mine in order to mitigate the worst developments of the deadly disease.
Anyone requesting to relocate in a mine — a labor right afforded to miners through the Part 90 program — must have their black lung testing results evaluated and marked eligible by a NIOSH worker in order to be approved.
But with DOGE’s cuts, those workers didn’t exist anymore.
The reduction in services for coal miners comes as a surge of black lung disease is hitting the workforce. It also hits as implementation of a federal rule that would limit miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust for the first time ever has been delayed.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners in central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
And the resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before. This is due to miners, because of a lack of easily accessible coal, being forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone than their predecessors in order to reach what little coal remains.
When the silica dust rule was slated to go into effect this month, the former secretary for the federal Department of Labor estimated that it could potentially save thousands of lives.
Now, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the federal Mine Health and Safety Administration — the agency that would be in charge of enacting and enforcing the silica rule — is being temporarily headed by an attorney who worked with industry groups that lobbied against implementation of exposure limits for silica, which advocates and coal mining veterans have colored as being life saving if ever implemented.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NIOSH-GettyImages-1439782819-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 12:21:00.334084

President Donald Trump marked the 100th day of his second term on Tuesday as Gov. JB Pritzker has spent the week calling on Americans to pressure congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s agenda and highlighting how Trump’s policies affect Illinois.

“I'm deeply concerned about what the next 100 days, and frankly, the next 1,000 days will be like,” Pritzker said Tuesday night during a virtual town hall.

Pritzker appeared on the progressive MeidasTouch podcast’s live town hall alongside three other Democratic governors: Kathy Hochul, of New York, Maura Healey, of Massachusetts, and Tim Walz, of Minnesota — the unsuccessful 2024 vice presidential nominee.

Throughout the town hall, the second-term Illinois governor continued calling for Americans to make their voices heard against what he perceives as a destructive Trump administration.

“I believe that we all ought to be mobilizing,” Pritzker told a Florida resident. “It's the best way for us to get across what we really believe is that, you know, show up at your Republican congressman's office and let them know: Quit shutting down veteran services, quit taking away Social Security and Medicaid.”

But for Democrats to be successful in future election cycles, the party must deliver results on voters’ priorities, Pritzker said. In addition to explaining a “simple message” about the party’s values to voters, Democrats should also embrace alternative media interviews to reach new voters, he said, pointing to a string of podcasts Walz appeared on during last year’s vice-presidential campaign.

“He was everywhere,” Pritzker said. “We've got to do that, all of us, and make sure that the Democratic message of standing up for working families is heard everywhere and directly to people who are online.”

Pritzker’s live podcast appearance Tuesday came two days after he delivered blistering criticism of unnamed people in his party for using podcasts and media interviews to chastise other Democrats.

“What I find ironic about the current conversation surrounding our party is that the voices flocking to podcasts and cable news shows to admonish fellow Democrats for not caring enough about the struggles of working families are the same ones who, when it comes to relieving the struggles of real people, have been timid, not bold,” Pritzker told a fundraiser for the New Hampshire Democratic Party on Sunday.

New Hampshire has typically held the first presidential primary election, usually following the Iowa caucus.

Pritzker, who also appeared Monday on MSNBC, has been working himself into the national spotlight for months since Trump took over the White House in January. Appearances on trendy podcasts and prime time cable TV shows have become a regular part of the governor’s schedule.

Pritzker received national attention after he warned of similarities between Nazi Germany and the Trump administration in his February State of the State address. His remarks in New Hampshire on Sunday drew more attention as headlines in publications including The New York Times declared the speech “stokes 2028 talks.”

Pritzker downplayed any links between the speech and his personal ambitions, saying he’s only trying to send a message to the party about what the platform for 2026 should be while defending Illinois against the Trump administration’s policies.

“I was surprised that so many people covered that,” Pritzker told reporters in Chicago on Monday.

The speech also struck a nerve with Republicans as Pritzker suggested Democrats “will never join so many Republicans in the special place in hell reserved for quislings and cowards.”

“Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption,” Pritzker said Sunday. “But I am now. These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace. They must understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone that we have. We must castigate them on the soap box and then punish them at the ballot box.”

Pritzker first called on Democrats to become “street fighters” and engage in mass protest at a Human Rights Campaign dinner in March in Los Angelas.

The Illinois Republican Party cried foul in a news release titled “Pritzker calls for violence against Republicans.”

“His comments if nothing else could be construed as inciting violence,” Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said.

Pritzker scoffed at Miller’s criticism, saying he didn’t listen to the speech.

“Peaceful protest is what I’m talking about. It’s about standing up, speaking out,” Pritzker told reporters. “Again, using your megaphone, your microphone, whatever you’ve got. And the peace that I’m talking about is making sure that they know at all times that the American public opposes the policies of Congressional Republicans and of the White House.”

Outside public appearances this week, Pritzker’s political organization also announced it was beginning a new video series highlighting Illinoisians who have been hurt by cuts to the federal government under Trump. And to mark Trump’s 100th day in office, the governor’s office released a list of 100 ways “Trump and Republicans are hurting Illinois.”

Responding to a Chicago voter’s concerns about affordable housing during Tuesday night’s town hall, Pritzker rattled off legislation and state spending increases approved under his administration as a way he’s trying to help. But he also argued it’s ultimately going to be challenging to address such concerns with Trump as president.

“Donald Trump is making everything harder,” Pritzker said. “Housing, rent, being able to borrow money to buy your first home, or any home, and that's something that we're all going to have to live with until we're able to overturn the Congress.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/ct-budget-republicans/,"With pressure on the spending cap and the threat of federal cuts, CT legislators are facing a tricky political mix as they craft a budget.","Drafting a state budget that spends tens of billions of dollars annually, often increases taxes or fees at least modestly — and always leaves some groups dissatisfied — is never an easy process.
Add to the mix the potential loss of billions in federal aid later this year, and the politics goes beyond tricky as legislators begin the final push to craft a new spending plan before they adjourn five weeks from now.
Majority Democratic legislators recently reminded Republicans to be careful with their budget rhetoric — because they may have to put their votes where their mouths are.
Meanwhile, House Republicans will remind Democrats on Thursday to be careful what they wish for when the GOP caucus unveils its own plan to solve Connecticut’s latest budget dilemma. And if Democrats are serious about good government, GOP leaders say, they can’t ignore ideas from the other side of the aisle.
Republicans criticize the budget but don’t always draft one
“This is a game they have played for years,” Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said of Republicans’ off-again, on-again approach to state finances.
With a couple of exceptions, Republicans have been in the minority at the state Capitol since 1985. The GOP held a slim 19-17 edge in the Senate in 1995 and 1996, and that chamber was tied 18-18 in the 2017 and 2018 sessions.
That means Democrats hold majorities on all committees, including the two budget-writing panels. It also means Republicans can propose a minority budget if they want — or simply criticize select elements of the Democrats’ plan without offering a holistic alternative.
Neither House nor Senate Republicans offered budgets in 2019 or 2021. Neither party did so in 2020, when COVID’s arrival forced the Capitol’s closure in early March. The Senate GOP also didn’t show its cards last year, and Sen. Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, the minority leader, said the caucus still hasn’t decided whether it will this year.
The GOP plans that are submitted often contain gimmicks and other questionable maneuvers, just as do the Democratic proposals they criticize. Democrats say Republican budgets routinely promise tax relief and easy fixes to deficits by exaggerating savings from hiring freezes, employing across-the-board cuts in miscellaneous accounts that don’t assess the actual impacts, and sometimes by thinking wishfully.
A 2010 GOP plan still recalled at the Capitol would have plugged a huge $800 million hole in the General Fund not by cutting programs or raising taxes — but by selling Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks and Hartford-Brainard Airport. About 5% of ongoing programs in the General Fund would have been covered, for one year, by one-time sales proceeds. Republicans decided Connecticut could get $800 million for the two airports based on the proposed 2009 sale of Chicago Midway International Airport for $2.5 billion, which ultimately fell through.
Democrats: GOP has voted to exceed the spending cap twice this year
Sen. Cathy Osten, a Democrat from Sprague who co-chairs the Appropriations Committee, was disappointed that her Senate GOP colleagues aren’t ready to write a budget detail, given their frequent calls for adherence to sound fiscal principles. 
“I think the [Republican] rhetoric is pretty strong this year,” she added.
Republicans chastised Osten’s panel last week when Democrats unveiled a $55.7 billion, biennial plan that would exceed Connecticut’s spending cap by $215 million next fiscal year.
Legislatures legally can exceed the cap, which ties most budget growth to household income and inflation, with a 60% vote of approval and the governor’s endorsement but haven’t done so since 2007. Exceeding the cap became politically taboo shortly after that as big spending growth, massive pension debt and a severe recession triggered major state tax hikes in 2009, 2011 and 2015.
Pressures on the spending cap
Democrats and Republicans voted overwhelmingly in late February to send an extra $40 million to local schools to mitigate a special education funding crisis. That happened despite warnings from Gov. Ned Lamont that the current state budget already was on pace to exceed the cap by $61 million.
And while the Appropriations Committee’s plan originally continued those extra $40 million special education payments for each of the next two fiscal years, members from both parties insisted they wanted more.
Republicans would support $124 million per year in extra payments, but only if funding for public colleges and universities were reduced by $84 million annually to offset the special ed increase. Higher education institutions entered this fiscal year with close to $1.1 billion in reserves and could absorb the cut, the GOP argued.
Democrats rejected that, noting that college students have faced significant tuition hikes in recent years. And hundreds of millions of dollars in temporary federal pandemic grants, which have propped up college and university programs, will vanish after this year.
Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London, then proposed adding another $84 million for special education in each of the next two years without offsetting cuts  to higher education, which pushed the committee budget from $131 million over the spending cap in 2025-26 to $215 million.
Despite their statements in support of the cap, about half of the committee’s 13 Republicans voted for Nolan’s amendment.
“If we agreed our children deserve that quality education,” Nolan said, “it shouldn’t be up for a debate.”
It’s easy to pledge allegiance to the spending cap, but harder to remain loyal when a priority like local school aid is on the chopping block, said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, who added there are consequences to heated political attacks.
“If your rhetoric gets too strong, you may lose things you had in the budget,” he said.
GOP: Democrats don’t listen, don’t save
But Republican leaders counter that Democrats have short memories.
The GOP always has been willing to come to the table, provided they are partners and their ideas are given due consideration. Too often, they added, Democrats simply want Republicans to vote for bloated spending and unnecessary tax hikes so both parties share the blame.
When Democrats couldn’t pass a budget in 2017 despite a House majority and control of the governor’s office, Republicans joined a bipartisan effort. That yielded new budget caps that built a paltry $212 million rainy day fund, equal to about 1% of the General Fund, into a record-setting $4.1 billion bulwark against the next recession.
Those same caps, or “fiscal guardrails,” also produced more than $8.5 billion in supplemental payments against Connecticut’s massive pension debt (the state entered this fiscal year with more than $35 billion in unfunded liabilities in this area). 
Republicans note that the last time Connecticut enjoyed big surpluses, before the “guardrails” era, Democratic-controlled legislatures spent far more than they socked away, even though those legislatures were working with Republican governors.
Between the 2003-04 and 2007-08 fiscal years, Connecticut ran up $3.6 billion in potential surpluses, according to records from the comptroller’s office and the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis.
But state officials would deposit just 38% of that windfall, about $1.38 billion, in the rainy day fund during this five-year period. The remaining $2.25 billion, or nearly two-thirds of the rest, would be spent.
While acknowledging that Republicans voted this year for special education funding that threatens to break the spending cap, Harding says his caucus still believes legislators must adhere to the “fiscal guardrails” while not boosting taxes.
“And it seems there’s an unwillingness to do that on their [Democrats’] end,” Harding said. 
The Democratic-controlled Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee proposed an income tax surcharge on the capital gains earnings of wealthy households and an array of business tax increases that collectively would generate more than $460 million per year. 
But while Democrats say some of that revenue would be needed to maintain state programs in the face of likely cuts in federal funding, about $175 million of that new revenue would be returned to poor and middle-class families in the form of a new $150-per-child income tax credit.
House Republicans also are expected to offer tax relief Thursday when they provide their own budget proposal for the next two fiscal years.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House GOP member on the Appropriations Committee, said her caucus always intended to offer its own solutions to the fiscal challenges facing Connecticut, adding it will be cost-efficient and respectful of the heavy burdens state taxpayers already face.
The real question, Nuccio added, is whether majority Democrats will include House Republicans in budget negotiations with the Lamont administration and incorporate GOP proposals into the final plan. 
“We are not the party of ‘No,’” Nuccio said. “We’re the party of options. We’re just being ignored.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0220_SR_PuraHearing_219-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 11:08:58.447310

Utah state leaders are taking the next steps in their efforts to make Utah a major nuclear energy development hub and a “national leader” in developing next-generation energy technology, reaching beyond state lines to do it.
It starts with Utah signing two memorandums of understanding with Idaho and Wyoming as part of a strategy to fire up innovation and collaboration in the region.
As part of Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’s “Built Here: Nuclear Energy Summit,” which his office said brought together leaders from across the nuclear energy industry on Tuesday, Cox joined Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, both Republicans, in signing an MOU that calls for the three states to work together coordinating nuclear infrastructure, accelerating nuclear development, and advocating for “commonsense federal policies.”
“The West will lead the next chapter of energy abundance and American prosperity,” Cox said in a statement announcing the alliance. “Today, we brought together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to chart the course for nuclear energy. Our new compact strengthens our shared commitment to aggressively pursue more affordable, reliable energy across state lines.”
According to Cox’s office, the states agreed in the MOU to collaborate on:

Aligning energy policies to support innovation and private investment.
Coordinating the development of critical energy infrastructure.
Jointly navigating regulatory and environmental challenges.
Advocating for federal support of regional energy priorities.
Enhancing energy resilience and grid reliability.
Expanding workforce development efforts to support the growing energy sector.
Ensuring continued delivery of affordable energy to residents.

The tri-state agreement comes the day after Utah officials and the Idaho National Laboratory — one of 17 national labs in the U.S. Department of Energy complex that’s focused on nuclear research — signed a memorandum of understanding Monday evening after ceremoniously signing a slate of energy bills Utah lawmakers passed earlier this year.
With more local input, Legislature signs on to the beginning of Utah’s nuclear future

The MOU between Utah leaders and the Idaho National Laboratory establishes a “formal, long-term collaboration on advanced energy research, workforce development and technology deployment — particularly on nuclear innovation,” according to the governor’s office.
“This partnership will accelerate Utah’s efforts to become the nation’s nuclear hub,” Cox said in a prepared statement issued Monday evening. “By linking our universities, labs, and industry partners with the expertise of Idaho National Laboratory, we are strengthening our ability to serve Utahns with reliable and affordable energy.”
Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner, who signed the MOU, said he and other lab officials are “excited to partner with Utah to address urgent energy needs by focusing on advanced nuclear and energy innovation.”
“This partnership establishes a cooperative framework for scientific, technological and workforce development to help Utah realize an abundant, secure, resilient and competitive energy future,” he said.
The MOU, according to the governor’s office, creates a “structural, interdisciplinary alliance” between Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory. It envisions Utah as establishing a new institute called the Advanced Nuclear Energy Institute as a “key coordinating hub” between the Idaho National Laboratory, Utah’s system of higher education, the Utah Office of Energy Development, and the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab.
“By linking the capabilities of INL with the talent and resources of Utah’s higher education institutions, this partnership positions Utah as a national leader in developing the next generation of clean, secure and resilient energy technologies,” the governor’s office said in Monday’s news release.
This new institute, state officials say, will enable Utah’s universities to collaborate with other organizations to pursue federal research grants.
“Beyond academic research, the focus is on applied innovation — ensuring resources are used effectively to develop commercially viable, scalable technologies,” the governor’s office said. “This approach will accelerate the deployment of real-world energy solutions and help build a broader, more robust nuclear energy ecosystem in Utah and the surrounding region.”
Through the MOU, state leaders say Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory will work together to:

Accelerate development of “next-generation” nuclear technologies.
Enhance scientific research in energy sectors.
Strengthen cybersecurity and physical security for energy infrastructure.
Build up the workforce needed to meet demands of a future energy economy.

The Utah legislature’s top Republican leaders both applauded the move as crucial for Utah’s future.
“Affordable, reliable energy is the driving force behind Utah’s prosperity — powering everything from the lights in Utahns homes to the unstoppable growth of the state’s vibrant economy,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a prepared statement. “As energy demands increase and technologies rapidly evolve, we as a state are committed to staying ahead of the curve through strategic partnership that ensures both innovation and stability.”
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said Utah “is leading the way with smart, strategic investments in our energy future.”
“This partnership drives innovation and keeps energy reliable and affordable for Utah families and businesses,” Schultz said. “It’s about long-term solutions that protect our economy and strengthen our position as a national energy leader.”

NEWARK — A high-speed crash involving a stolen U-Haul truck left one person dead and several others injured Monday evening in downtown Newark.
The incident began around 4:30 p.m. when Newark Police located a U-Haul vehicle reported as unauthorized after it was not returned on its scheduled due date of March 18.
The truck, occupied by two individuals, was found in a parking lot in the 200 block of East Main Street.
As officers moved in to arrest the suspects, the vehicle sped off, striking a marked police car in the process.
Police say they did not pursue the vehicle, which exited the lot at a high speed.
Just minutes later, around 4:35 p.m., the truck was traveling westbound on East Main Street when it struck two pedestrians standing beside a parked car.
The vehicle continued on, hitting multiple parked cars before becoming disabled farther down the road.
First responders arrived quickly to render aid. One pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene despite life-saving efforts.

A second victim sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital.
Their identities have not yet been released, pending notification of next of kin.
The driver of the U-Haul also sustained serious injuries and was taken to the hospital. Both the driver and passenger were detained by police at the scene.
According to Aetna Hose, Hook & Ladder Company, three additional people were transported to a nearby emergency room with non-life-threatening injuries, while three others were treated on site and declined further medical care.
The Newark Police Department‘s Traffic Unit is investigating the crash.
East Main Street remains closed near South Chapel Street, and authorities expect the closure to continue for several hours.
Police emphasized that this appears to be an isolated incident and there is no ongoing threat to the public.
Further details will be released as the investigation continues.
“Just before 5 p.m. today, University leadership was made aware of a serious incident on Main Street, east of Academy Street,” University of Delaware stated in social media posts. “There is no ongoing danger to the campus community, though East Main Street is closed starting at South Chapel Street. More information will be shared if and when it is appropriate to do so. Please avoid the area and follow all instructions from the police.”

The week-long firefight began near Johnstown in Brown County after a prescribed burn escaped containment on April 21, which a private landowner had led in coordination with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, local fire departments and other partners.. 
Last week, Gov. Jim Pillen initiated a statewide burn ban through the end of April. On Tuesday, he narrowed the ban to and extended it for central and western Nebraska through midnight on May 10. He also prohibited permitted burns in eastern Nebraska if there is an active red flag warning from the National Weather Service.
Excutive Order Burn Permit Suspension Map (1)
More than 7,000 acres were burned in the Plum Creek area that includes canyons, hills and water on the northern edge, which state officials said had complicated the disaster response.
Over 50 different local fire departments, many volunteer-based, responded to the fire, as did the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, NEMA, State Fire Marshal’s Office, Nebraska National Guard, Nebraska State Patrol, Game and Parks and Nebraska Forest Service.
More than 45 cattle were killed, and the fire destroyed one cabin (a secondary residence) and at least eight utility poles.
The fire and continued burn ban came amid severe drought conditions for much of the state.
“It’s way too dry, and it doesn’t make any sense,” Pillen told reporters last Wednesday. “It only takes one burn, one mistake, and the one that took place … really, really made no sense.”
He continued: “We need Mother Nature to get on our side, and we need to get drenched. We need a tsunami. So if Nebraskans want to pray for a tsunami, I think we’d take that, right, or a drenching rain.”

Limestone University’s governing board made the final decision after several hours of deliberations late Tuesday, the last day of classes for the spring semester. The vote for closure followed a series of hopes and disappointments for students unsure about the fate of their school and their academic and athletic future.
The college first made its financial straits known two weeks ago, when President Nathan Copeland announced to students and staff that Limestone faced a $6 million budget shortfall, which could lead to its closure.
Limestone had been holding out for an eleventh hour donation in hopes of keeping its doors open. It managed to raise $2.1 million but still fell short of what school officials said it needed to stay afloat in the short term.
Even if it had succeeded, the college still would have needed a long-term solution to its growing financial woes.
“Words cannot fully express the sorrow we feel in having to share this news,” Copeland said in a statement. “Our students, alumni, faculty, staff, and supporters fought tirelessly to save this historic institution. While the outcome is not what we hoped for, we are forever grateful for the passion, loyalty, and prayers of our Saints family.”
The school has cited enrollment declines impacting colleges nationwide and rising costs for its demise.
Limestone’s enrollment fell by half over the past decade, from 3,214 students in fall 2014, according to state higher education data, to 1,600 now, both online and in person according to the university’s announcement.
At first, the board said it would continue with its online classes, which would have allowed the college to continue with its associated charter school management operations — Limestone Charter Association — which sponors 13 K-12 public charter schools.
But online operations are also ending and at least 478 people employed by the college are losing their jobs.










Limestone has been a point of pride, tradition, and inspiration for our residents. It has opened doors for countless local students and families. Many of them were first-generation college students and helped shape dreams into realitie


– Lyman Dawkins III, mayor of Gaffney


Limestone was founded in 1845 by Thomas Curtis, a Baptist minister from England. It began as the Limestone Springs Female High School and held classes in the town’s former hotel, built by the founder of a limestone quarry that supported the area economy for nearly a century.
At the time of its opening, Limestone was the first women’s college in South Carolina, and among the first in the country. The college began admitting men in the early 1900s, but did not initially allow them to live on campus.
While not the largest employer in Cherokee County, it is the county’s only four-year institution of higher education.
Gaffney’s mayor and Limestone alumnus Lyman Dawkins III, called the college “a cornerstone of our city educationally, economically and culturally.”
“Limestone has provided countless jobs, brought in students and families who supported local businesses and served as a catalyst for growth,” Dawkins wrote in an online statement after closure was first announced two weeks ago.
He cited Gaffney’s efforts to revitalize its downtown and said students have played a vital role.
“Their energy, involvement, and contributions have breathed life into our city and helped us build momentum for the future,” Dawkins said.
“Limestone has been a point of pride, tradition, and inspiration for our residents. It has opened doors for countless local students and families. Many of them were first-generation college students and helped shape dreams into realities,” Dawkins added.
Auditors reported the school had a $7.6 million operating loss as of June 2024. Its shortfalls were caused by a decline in enrollment and uncontrolled spending in previous years.
Since 2020, the school has borrowed some $22 million from its small endowment, which had a balance of just $9.2 million last June the audit showed.
“These factors create uncertainty regarding the University’s ability to continue,” the auditors wrote.
The school also faced an additional $30 million in debt, according to Copeland, who took over as university president last year and laid plans he hoped could have sustained the school. The debt comes from a 40-year U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development loan, which Limestone took out in 2018 to construct a new library and student center, purchase a residence hall and refinance previous debt.
Limestone is not alone. Small, private colleges with meager endowments have been closing across the country. According to Inside Higher Ed, 2023 saw 15 colleges announce closures. That was followed by another 16 in 2024.

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA— Strangulation is among the most common types of abuse in domestic violence situations. Yet, South Carolina is the only state without specific penalties for the crime.
A Senate proposal seeks to change that.
Restricting someone’s ability to breathe with the intent to hurt them would be punishable by between three and 10 years in prison under the proposal which passed unanimously out of committee Tuesday to be taken up on the Senate floor. Penalties climb as high as 20 years in prison when someone uses a weapon, violates a restraining order or has a prior strangulation convection.
If passed in the Senate, the bill will still have to go through the legislative process in the House. Meanwhile only five legislative days remain in the first year of the two-year session.
When it was her turn to speak in favor of the bill, Lauren Moose, a forensic nurse examiner at McLeod Health in Florence, asked a Senate panel to set a timer for 2 ½ minutes and stay silent. That’s the amount of time it takes to kill someone by strangling them, she explained.
“Think about somebody sitting there, literally watching somebody’s life exit their hands,” she said.
Domestic violence victims in SC can wait weeks for legal protections

The Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention says between 68% and 80% of abused women will experience “near-fatal strangulation.”
And the likelihood of being killed by your partner is 10 times higher if they’ve strangled you, the National Domestic Violence Hotline says on its website.
South Carolina has a long history of domestic violence, particularly against women. For a quarter century, the state was consistently in the top 10 nationally in the murder rate for women killed by men, according to the Violence Policy Center. While the center no longer rates states, South Carolina still outpaced the national rate. In 2022, the most recent year of data available, 56 female victims were killed by men in the state.
The state still has the sixth-highest rate of domestic violence in the country, according to Break the Cycle, a nonprofit dedicated to helping survivors of domestic violence.
A Senator on the committee said he’s seen what strangulation can do firsthand.
Sen. Ed Sutton, D-Charleston, said his cousin was the victim of domestic violence in which her abuser strangled her. After the attack, she continued to have long-term breathing issues. Tori Burke died in 2021, a year later, after contracting COVID-19, leaving behind two daughters.
“This is a pretty awful crime and a pretty awful thing for a family to go through,” he said.
Still, others questioned whether the law was necessary, arguing these crimes already fall under assault.
Freshman Sen. J.D. Chaplin said he worries the bill is excessive.
“Why do we need something for strangulation?” the Hartsville Republican asked.
Hundreds of girls in SC are trafficking victims. A Columbia nonprofit offers help for survivors.

Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, said he supported “the overall context of protecting domestic violence victims and anyone else from strangulation” but wanted to know whether it would affect police trying to restrain a suspect.
The bill’s lead sponsor, Sen. Brian Adams, responded to questions saying strangulation tends to be more violent than a typical assault.
Plus, the state Legislature already passed a law in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death at the hands of police officers in Minnesota, the Goose Creek Republican reminded his fellow senators. That law banning the use of chokeholds except in a situation where deadly force would be reasonable went into effect on New Years Day 2023.
The proposed strangulation charge would actually help law enforcement, according to Adams, who is a retired police officer.
Cases involving strangulation tend to result in either low or medium-level assault charges, Brian Bennett, a retired officer of the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy, told the SC Daily Gazette.
“No law for strangulation means it can be minimized,” said Bennett, who has been advocating for strangulation laws for a decade.
The bill would make strangulation a felony with significant prison time, which Bennett said better fits a crime where the effects tend to be long-lasting. It also would make it easier to track how prevalent the crime is in the state.
There have been multiple bills filed in recent years to create strangulation charges, including a House proposal filed back in December before this year’s session. None have gotten significant traction. Bennett has begged legislators to consider each one, with no success. Yet, he’s felt the pleas slowly create awareness within the Statehouse, he said.
“I think they are more receptive than they were in the past,” he said. “It’s like every session we gain ground.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-76-1-1024x576.png,,,2025-04-30 10:08:23.621695

Joe Nicola, shown on the opening day of the 2025 legislative session, complained Tuesday night that the state budget process “is a dog and pony show” (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The only member of the Missouri Senate who was never a public official before winning election had a scathing verdict on the budget debate he witnessed Tuesday night.
“I think this is one of the worst processes I’ve ever seen and been a part of,” said state Sen. Joe Nicola, a Republican from Independence. “I think it’s broken.”
Nicola spoke after watching the bitterest 20 minutes of the five-hour budget debate. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough had just finished telling state Sen. Rick Brattin of Harrisonville that he would not support an amendment restoring 25 employees and $684,000 cut from Secretary of State Denny Hoskins’ budget during committee work.
One of the reasons Hough gave for opposing any amendments to the bills was that many budget lines include both state and federal money, where Missouri taxpayers supply matching funds at varying rates.
Increasing the state money spent on one, Hough said, triggers changes in how much federal funding should be listed. It was all too complicated to change anything on the floor, he added.
“There is so much work that goes in behind the scenes and in the committee that when you come out here and you start — and you can laugh, if you would like — but if you come out here and you start changing, and you start amending the budget bills, you don’t understand the actual implications,” Hough said.
But Nicola’s complaint wasn’t completely about the scene he had witnessed. It was that he was lost trying to read the 13 bills appropriating $49.5 billion in large amounts for education, public safety, health and welfare programs alongside small sums for things described in often obscure language.
“Just pass it. We can’t put an amendment, very little debate, like we’re wasting our time,” Nicola said. “This whole thing is a dog and pony show. Absolutely ridiculous.”
With Senate passage of the 13 bills, they return to the House and the process to set up a conference committee to negotiate a final proposal will begin. The Senate Appropriations Committee must now turn to capital appropriations bills spending an additional $3.7 billion and get them ready for Senate votes.
 Gov. Mike Kehoe reiterates his focus on public safety during his State of the State speech Jan. 28 in the Missouri House chamber (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The conference committee will have to reconcile differences over education funding that will test new Gov. Mike Kehoe’s ability and willingness to influence the outcome.
The Senate-passed budget allocates almost $300 million more than Kehoe requested for the public school foundation formula and omits $50 million the governor wanted to enlarge a scholarship program for private school tuition.
Overall, the Senate budget would spend $1.6 billion more than the House version and $575 million less that Kehoe requested. In general revenue — money mainly from income and sales taxes — the Senate plan would spend $15.7 billion, $491 million more than Kehoe proposed and $1.3 billion more than the House version.
Other significant differences between the House and Senate include:

The state employee pay plan. The Senate and Kehoe propose a raise of 1% for every two years worked, capped at 10%. The House version is capped at a 5% raise.
New child care funding. The Senate approved Kehoe’s request for $107 million to shift the child care subsidy program to prospective payments based on enrollment instead of after-the-fact payments based on attendance. The House did not approve the money.
Higher education funding. Kehoe proposed a 1.5% increase for colleges and universities, the House agreed and added $28 million for one-time maintenance and repair and the Senate proposed an ongoing 3% increase.
Earmarks for projects and programs. The House added 149 items to the budget with a total cost of $295 million. The Senate cut 57, totaling $126.3 million, and added 169 of its own to the operating budget at a cost of $441 million. There are 44 earmarks in the capital appropriations that have not had a Senate committee hearing yet.

The school funding differences in the budget will be the biggest item of contention in the conference committee.
When Kehoe, who is in his first year as governor, refused to fund an increase to public schools based on the statutory calculation of the foundation formula, he said the extra money was the result of bureaucratic processes that he distrusted.
The House, in the budget it approved at the beginning of April, went along with Kehoe, funding the public school formula at the $3.7 billion being spent this year.
As he presented the budget, Hough said the extra money represents a promise from the past that must be fulfilled.
“I see this as making good on the commitment that was passed by the legislature last year,” Hough said.
The element that will decide how much is eventually spent on the foundation formula is the state adequacy target, the calculation of the per-pupil amount spent in districts that are high-performing on state accountability measures. For the current year, the amount is $6,760 per student and the statutory calculation in the formula would make it $7,145 for the coming fiscal year.
The legislature can set the number in the appropriation bill and that is what will test Kehoe’s ability and willingness to influence the upcoming conference committee. 
 State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern is introduced to the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
During debate, Democrats said even the increased funding was inadequate. State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Democrat from Kansas City and a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Missouri needs to do more for schools.
“People ask me, ‘oh do you love the Senate version of the budget?’’’ Nurrenbern said. “No, I don’t love the Senate version of the budget, because we are putting less money into public education than nearly every other state in the nation.”
The discussion of the increase to the foundation formula was one of the longest of the budget debate. There was no discussion at all, however, of the cut to the private-school scholarship program.
And while most of the focus during debate on the bill funding education programs was on the increased foundation formula, discussion veered into culture wars when Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman offered an amendment to bar all funding for the YMCA.
Kansas City police are investigating reports of an incident at the North Kansas City YMCA where a child reported an adult with male genitalia exposed was in a women’s locker room. WDAF Fox4 reported that the mother of the child said the person claimed to be a woman.
Coleman said she was upset by statements from the YMCA that “individuals are allowed to use the locker room or restroom that they identify with.” She also said she was offended when representatives of the YMCA, visiting her office, did not respect her concerns that state law was not being followed.
“The frustration that I have of a lack of taking seriously the state laws from a provider that is being paid from the state I thought warranted a vote on this defunding,” Coleman said.
Other lawmakers defended YMCA as a provider of important programs for children. Hough said the organization receives about $12- to $13 million a year in state funding, mostly for after school and summer camp programs through child care programs.
“Imagine if we came in and, for one weird incident, started penalizing across the board, removing all funding” from private organizations, Nurrenbern said.
Coleman eventually withdrew the amendment, but she forced a vote later in the Department of Corrections budget when she tried to cut $21,900 in funding to purchase drugs used for executions.
“These are Chinese made pharmaceuticals that are used to kill by the state those who’ve been convicted of the death penalty,” Coleman said. “And you know when I was first elected I think I would have said that I was in favor of the death penalty, and I have had a real evolution, as I have learned more about how inconsistently it has been applied, and I no longer support it.”
Brattin spoke against the amendment, arguing that he preferred public executions by firing squads.
“Mercy to those who carry out these sorts of acts is an injustice to the victims and their families,” Brattin said.
Coleman’s amendment was defeated 11-22.
The budget is balanced by tapping the state’s accumulated surplus. But with revenues declining more than 1% and uncertainty about future federal funding, the only member who was a lawmaker during the contraction following the 2008 financial crash warned his colleagues to be careful with the surplus.
State Sen. Stephen Webber, a Democrat from Columbia, was a House member from 2009 to 20017. In his first years in office, lawmakers made budget cuts, not increases.
“I’m just telling everybody it’s a lot more enjoyable when you’re adding money for worthy projects in your district, rather than when you’re trying to explain to folks in your district that even though you support the program, it has to get cut because there’s just no other money,” Webber said.
Hough, during a discussion with Nurrenbern, said that while there are dozens of projects in the budget requested by lawmakers, he has to draw the line somewhere. He noted he had turned down her requests to help child care providers in her district.
“I’ve had other members that have come in and said, you know, we need to spend X number of dollars on this courthouse,” Hough said. “Well, that’s great, but do you know how many courthouses there are in the state? And if we open that box, how do we ever bring it back in?”
 Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, shown in 2024 while he was a member of the state Senate, lost 25 employees in a budget cut political friends said was revenge for his activities as a member of the Missouri Freedom Caucus (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The disagreement over the employees cut from Hoskins’ budget was a reminder of the factional fights that wracked the Senate over the last four years. Hoskins, a former state senator, was a member of the Freedom Caucus, and before it a group that called itself the conservative caucus.
During budget work, Hoskins would target employee slots that had been unfilled for lengthy periods. One of his factional foes, state Sen. Mike Cierpiot, a Republican from Lee’s Summit, used that logic to cut 25 of 63 open positions in Hoskins’ new office.
“I thought taking 25 of those 63 was a very reasonable, measured way to do things,” Cierpiot said while debating with state Sen. Ben Brown, a Republican from Washington 
“But only with the person that’s now running a state office, that that may have had disagreements with you in the past,” Brown replied.
“No, only with a person who has talked about doing this for years in the past,” Cierpiot said.
Every statewide elected official’s office used less than its allotment of employee hours in the most recent complete fiscal year. The vacancy rate for the secretary of state’s office was 23.3%, lower than any other office except state treasurer.
Brattin complained that offices with higher vacancy rates remained untouched while Hoskins lost 25 slots and Lt. Gov. David Wasinger, who defeated Hough in the 2024 Republican primary, lost one of eight assigned to his office.
“It is below what I thought we had kind of gotten to, the place of the Senate this session, trying to let bygones be bygones,” Brattin said. “But it’s quite clear that that’s not what we’re willing to do here, and utilize their position and act as though we’re a bunch of imbeciles.”

Photo courtesy of the Minnesota Historical Society.The Minnesota House passed a housing budget bill Tuesday, featuring funding boosts for homelessness prevention and affordable housing development, plus $100 million in bonds for financing housing developments statewide. 
But the Senate’s housing budget, which passed the chamber last week, is about $62 million smaller than the House version and it doesn’t include bonds. 
The details must be hashed out in conference committee and re-approved by both chambers before the legislative session adjourns on May 19. 
Neither the budget bill nor a housing policy bill that passed Thursday includes the sweeping zoning reforms proposed by a bipartisan coalition of advocacy groups and lawmakers, including all housing committee leaders. Those bills would have allowed apartments in areas currently zoned for commercial use; legalized duplexes on every residential lot in the state; required municipalities to allow higher-density development along transit corridors; and barred city governments from requiring builders to use certain materials, colors or designs.
Supporters of those bills argue that they would encourage the construction of more housing, alleviating Minnesota’s housing shortage and lowering prices.
The outlook is bleak for those bills, as city governments and their lobbyists oppose any legislation that rolls back local control over zoning.
In floor discussion of the budget bill, housing leaders said the budget doesn’t go far enough in addressing the shortage. 
“I’m a little disappointed,” said Rep. Jim Nash, R-Waconia, a member of the housing committee and the coalition pushing for zoning reforms. Regulatory reform is needed to make a major dent in the housing crisis, he said. 
The “Yes to Homes” coalition got one minor win: the House budget bill instructs the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency to prioritize developments in communities that have zoning rules that make it easier to build multifamily homes, allow smaller homes and don’t require certain materials or designs.  
Funding for homelessness prevention 
The House housing budget contains significantly more funding than the Senate version for a homelessness prevention program. 
The Family Homelessness Prevention and Assistance Program, or FHPAP, provides emergency assistance to families that are at risk of homelessness, or who have already lost their housing.
Lawmakers have allocated between $7 and $10 million per year to the program between 2014 and 2023; during the 2023 legislative session, lawmakers directed $120 million to the FHPAP for 2024 and 2025. The House budget would give the program $50 million in 2026 and 2027; the Senate budget allocates $30 million.
Jenny Larson, executive director of Three Rivers Community Action, which manages FHPAP in several southern Minnesota counties, said despite state investments, the program is already oversubscribed. Her agency opens up a round of funding every quarter, and they are never able to help all of the families in need, Larson said. 
Brooklyn Park resident Ta-Metta Gaines, who lives in the embattled Huntington Place apartments, works as a customer service representative for a health care company. She fell behind on rent while dealing with medical issues, she said, and she’s looking for a new place to live as Huntington Place’s future is in limbo. 
When she became homeless after her landlord died, FHPAP helped her come up with a security deposit and first month’s rent to move into a new apartment. Now, FHPAP is helping her get caught up on past-due rent, and covering some of the cost of relocating, Gaines said.
“I’m just imagining what type of things can actually go on if they remove those funds, and how many people will be destitute,” Gaines said. 
Bonding
While the House housing budget authorizes the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency to issue $100 million in bonds to finance housing projects, lawmakers and Gov. Tim Walz have not agreed on targets for a bonding bill. 
Bonds are a tool governments use to finance infrastructure projects, including housing. Bonding bills require a 60% majority to pass the Legislature, so they require robust bipartisan support. 
Walz and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say they want to pass a bonding bill this session, in addition to the regular two-year budget. If the parties can’t make a deal on bonding — as was the case last year — the bonding in the housing budget is likely to be eliminated in conference committee.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mncapitol-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 10:08:23.621695

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Energy policy has moved quickly in the past few years as Maine has sought to achieve climate and affordability goals with deadlines that are not so far off. 
Rep. Gerry Runte (D-York) suspects there hasn’t been sufficient time to take a 50,000-foot view to see how all the pieces of energy supply and demand could plan and work together. He’s hoping the bipartisan bill he introduced during a public hearing Tuesday afternoon will formalize and increase collaboration between agencies involved in grid planning. 
“I need to emphasize: the intent of this bill is not to interfere with the ongoing grid planning process,” Runte told the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee. Rather, its purpose is “to refine how it interacts with other initiatives and give it a bit of a tune up for future planning.” 
The grid is the system of transmission and distribution lines that bring electricity from where it is generated to the homes of ratepayers and other points of end use. 
Last summer, the Public Utilities Commission concluded its process of gathering input on priorities for grid plans. The largest privately owned utilities in the state, Central Maine Power and Versant Power, are required to submit their plans next January, Runte said. 
Meanwhile, the Governor’s Energy Office completed the state’s energy plan earlier this year that laid out pathways to achieve climate resilience and affordability goals. The portions of the plan that focused on electricity were based on a supply and demand forecast that considered reliability, emissions reductions, the role of emerging technologies and more, Runte explained. 
As Runte understands it, that forecast in the state’s energy plan looked circuit by circuit to develop a bottom-up analysis. However, the forecasting model used in the Public Utility Commission’s grid planning looks at capacity and load data from the regional grid, ISO-New England, taking a more top-down approach. 
Maine doubles down on commitment to address climate change with updated action plan

Given the connection between the state’s energy plan and future grid needs, Runte said he believes the agencies involved in grid planning should use the same load forecast. While LD 1726 calls for using the forecasting model in the state energy plan, Runte said he expects robust discussion on which of the two may be more appropriate. 
Public Advocate Heather Sanborn testified neither for nor against the bill, however, she raised concerns about limiting the forecast model over an uncertain amount of time because energy forecasting models are constantly evolving.
The bill also seeks to ensure that future planning considers grid enhancing technologies at the energy distribution level that could improve efficiency and reliability. To do that, the proposal would have the Public Utilities Commission consider adding incentives for improved data and grid monitoring of power quality reliability, the state of infrastructure, as well as capacity. 
Runte’s proposal also addresses the procurement of new energy sources. While the legislation covers multiple aspects of procurement, Runte said the bids for those new sources should be informed by the grid planning process to minimize the amount of new infrastructure. 
Another aspect of grid planning is energy demand management and non-wires alternatives — or projects that use alternative technology to avoid new investment in the transmission system. Currently, those two components are spread between three different agencies in Maine. Runte’s bill would ask the Public Utilities Commission, the Office of Public Advocate and Efficiency Maine to assess how those aspects of planning are shared among them and report back to the Legislature on how the process could be improved.
“The idea of this bill is to strengthen governance by establishing formal linkages to activities that have a direct impact on or perhaps should be subject to the findings of a grid plan,” Runte told the committee.
The Public Utilities Commission, as well as the Governor’s Energy Office, also offered neutral testimony on the proposal. Though legislative liaison Caroline Colan said the Governor’s Energy Office shares Runte’s goal of enhancing coordination where feasible in grid planning processes, she said some parts of the bill could be overly prescriptive.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s comparison of current prevalence rates to those from the 1980s or earlier ignores this historical context. Autistic people have always been here. We are simply doing a better job of recognizing and supporting them.
The post Autism is not an ‘epidemic,’ as RFK Jr. suggests appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has deeply alarmed us with his comments that repeat long-debunked theories, stigmatize people, and misrepresent everything about autism.  Instead of amplifying disinformation, we should be focusing on what really matters: recognizing the value of every person and ensuring that autistic people have the support and community they need to lead meaningful, connected lives. Calling autism an “epidemic” reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how autism is identified and diagnosed. An increase in diagnoses does not mean autism is dangerous.  It reflects decades of expanded awareness, broader diagnostic criteria, and improved access to services. It wasn’t until 1980 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual even included autism.  Since then, many people who would previously have gone undiagnosed or were misdiagnosed are now counted.   Kennedy’s comparison of current prevalence rates to those from the 1980s or earlier ignores this historical context. Autistic people have always been here. We are simply doing a better job of recognizing and supporting them. His claim that autistic individuals will “never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go out on a date” is not only false, but it demonstrates a lack of understanding of the complexity of autism. Our organization, the Association for Autism and Neurodiversity (AANE), is based in Watertown but supports thousands of autistic community members across the country who prove him wrong.  Many autistic adults have run the Boston Marathon. We see autistic employees thrive at work. Autistic writers publish their poetry. We have seen relationships blossom in our community and welcomed children of autistic parents. Autistic people are not one dimensional. As often as we see people thrive, we also acknowledge the deep distress and anxiety that loneliness, isolation, under- and unemployment bring. These challenges are exacerbated by systems that do not offer understanding, inclusion, or accommodation. The effort it takes to find providers or services that are attuned to autistic needs is often exhausting and requires persistence and patience.  Studies estimate that 70–95% of autistic individuals also experience mental health challenges, yet many give up after just one or two failed attempts to find a provider who understands autism. Autistic individuals with high support needs often face long waitlists, underfunded programs, staffing shortages, and inconsistent quality of care. These are solvable problems, but they are not solved by calling autism a “tragedy.”  Kennedy’s claim that autism, “is a preventable disease. We know it’s environmental exposure. It has to be,” simply isn’t true. Decades of peer-reviewed scientific research show that genetics are the primary factor in autism. Studies published in major journals and  reports from the National Institutes of Health consistently find that inherited genetic factors can account for anywhere between 40 to 80 percent of the risk for autism.  Kennedy acts like scientists have ignored environmental factors, but that’s not true. Researchers have spent decades studying them. What they’ve found is clear: Genetics are by far the strongest factor in autism, not any one exposure or event.  In fact, the newly formed Coalition of Autism Scientists, which was founded in Massachusetts, strongly critiqued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Autism Research Initiative. This group of experienced research scientists repudiated what it calls Kennedy’s “false narrative about the incidence and causes of autism” and expressed concern “to hear the Secretary of Health & Human Services dismiss past research [and] downplay the causal role of genes.” As the group’s leader, Dr. Helen Tager-Flusber, stated, “Instead of focusing on questions that have been asked and answered, limited and valuable research dollars must focus on what we don’t yet know about autism so that we can meet the urgent needs of autism individuals and their families.” We cannot let outdated thinking shape national policy. Our leaders must reject disinformation. They need to center the voices and experiences of autistic individuals and their families. We should all want a future where every individual, regardless of neurology, is valued, supported, and empowered to thrive.  Brenda Dater is the executive director of the Association for Autism and Neurodiversity (AANE), a  Watertown, MA based organization that provides education and support for autistic and neurodivergent people and their families. The post Autism is not an ‘epidemic,’ as RFK Jr. suggests appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Autism_RFK-Jr.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

Most recently, she served as dean of the University of California Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.In the early 1990s, Anand covered southern Vermont and the City of Rutland for The Rutland Herald, where she uncovered across-the-board errors in Vermont by one of the nation’s biggest credit reporting companies, prompting Congress to pass a new law.Eager to hone her investigative reporting skills, Anand eventually left the Herald for bigger news publications. But even as she did so, she promised her husband, Greg Kroitzsh, a Vermonter whose parents ran the Salt Ash Inn in Plymouth, that they would return one day in the future, when she hoped to bring all of her skills and experience to lead a news publication. “This job is really coming full circle for Greg and me,” Anand said. “It has always been our dream to come back to Vermont, and this job gives us the chance to do that in a way that is truly meaningful as a journalist and journalism leader.” In her role at VTDigger, Anand will lead the 20-plus VTDigger newsroom to excel in its mission to produce rigorous journalism that explains complex issues, promotes public accountability and fosters democratic and civic engagement.“I look forward to working with VTDigger’s staff and board to develop a bold and ambitious vision for our newsroom’s future,” Anand said.“We will together find a way to enable our newsroom to take on the biggest, boldest investigative projects while also continuing to cover the most important news in our state,” she said. “My first task will be mentoring and supporting our editorial staff in achieving these goals while also leading sustainable lives.”“I will also relish supporting CEO Sky Barsch in raising the funds to make VTDigger’s journalism sustainable, and in continuing to create a supportive newsroom culture,” she continued. “It is fundamental to enabling our reporters and editors having the emotional resilience to produce courageous journalism over the long term.”Barsch said Anand’s appointment marks a defining moment for Vermont journalism, one that will shape the future of independent news in the state.“Geeta Anand is not only one of the most extraordinary journalists of our time, she’s also a visionary with a gift for inspiring and empowering those around her,” Barsch said. “The excitement we feel about her joining our team is matched only by the impact her leadership will have on the state of Vermont.”  Gaye Symington, president of the Vermont Journalism Trust, VTDigger’s parent organization, highlighted the importance of VTDigger’s new editorial leadership.“That a leader of Geeta’s caliber is eager to move across the country to lead VTDigger’s newsroom is a powerful testament to the quality of our journalism and its impact on Vermont,” Symington said.Anand’s first day with VTDigger is July 1.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Geeta Anand named editor-in-chief of VTDigger.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Geeta-Anand-by-Christopher-Michel-290405-5-9-23_cropped.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

“My kids were five and seven. I was just thinking about whether or not I would live long enough to be able to dance with my sons at their weddings,” Batch recalled at a Tuesday press conference.
Batch, a primary sponsor of Senate Bill 553, said the “Save More Tatas Act” would provide health coverage parity for breast cancer diagnostic imaging.
Far too many women in North Carolina don’t get diagnosed with breast cancer early, because they don’t get the proper diagnostic treatment and preventative treatment that would save their lives.
“Most importantly, you sure as heck shouldn’t be in a situation where women are denied access because they can’t afford the actual screenings,” said Sen. Batch.
‘Divine intervention’
Sen. Val Applewhite (D-Cumberland) said when she retired from the United States Air Force after 20 years, she received a screening mammogram as she was processed out of the military. It came back normal.

A year later she credits divine intervention with saving her life.
“My mother, who had passed years earlier, came to me in my dream. She said, ‘Val, go get a mammogram.’ So, I made the appointment. And that’s when I got the diagnosis, I had breast cancer. I was lucky.”
Applewhite was lucky that she was working at the Pentagon. She received her cancer treatment at Bethesda Naval Medical Center, the same place the President of the United States receives medical care.
“That access, plain and simple, is what saved my life. Too many people in North Carolina don’t have that,” said Applewhite.
The Cumberland County Democrat said another portion of SB 553 would allocate $3.5 million to help recruit and retain mammography technologists in rural and underserved areas.
Skipping tests when you can’t afford the co-pay
Rep. Mary Belk (D-Mecklenburg) is yet another member of this extraordinary sorority of breast cancer survivors.
  Rep. Mary Belk (Photo: NCGA)
Belk said she had finished a grueling day of campaigning in 2016 when she felt something.
She didn’t want to call it a lump. That was too scary. But she made time for an overdue breast exam.
“I heard the words that no one wants to hear:  You have breast cancer,” said Belk. “I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer, three months before my first election.”
Approximately 14,700 women in North Carolina will have breast cancer this year. Fourteen hundred will not survive, Belk said.
But with first rate care, her cancer went into remission. She was one of the lucky few who did not worry about the cost of imaging.
“Women who need these medically necessary tests are skipping them because they cannot afford the co-pays,” said Belk.
Breast MRIs in North Carolina can cost anywhere between $260 and over $1,300, depending on one’s health plan.
Belk is the primary sponsor of House Bill 297. The Breast Cancer Prevention Imaging Parity bill would require insurance companies to cover diagnostic, screening as well as supplemental breast exams to the same extent as mammograms.
This coverage is especially important for women with dense breasts who are at risk of being diagnosed at later stages.
Causing a ‘ruckus’ for advanced imaging
Sheila Mikhail falls into that category. The self-described ‘serial, biotech entrepreneur’ created multiple companies in the Research Triangle Park along with thousands of well-paying jobs.

Yet when cancer was found in her left breast, she repeatedly had to push for additional screenings of her right breast.
The oncologist told her she was causing a ‘ruckus’, but the office would do a supplemental test at a cost of $1,200.
The breast MRI found a second tumor that was not detected by an ultrasound or a diagnostic mammogram.
“I was fortunate because I could afford to pay. I found my right tumor just before it metastasized.”
Mikhail wants lawmakers to pass both HB 297 and SB 553 and have insurance companies cover supplemental ultrasounds and MRIs for breast cancer.
A narrow window to gain passage
But the time to pass these bills this session is growing short. May 8th marks the crossover deadline for bills to pass at least one chamber to stay eligible for consideration.
Senate Bill 553 has been stuck in the Rules committee since March.
Belk’s bill (“Breast Cancer Prevention Imaging Parity”) was approved by three House committees, but before a floor vote in mid-April, it was withdrawn from the House calendar and kicked back to the Rules committee. No reason was provided.
Batch said she has had many, many conversations with her Republican colleagues, but faces opposition because some insurance companies don’t want another mandate that requires them to pay for additional coverage.
Sen. Applewhite said this should not be a partisan issue. She’d like female voters to call their representatives.

The original proposal would have mandated phonics instruction in K-12 classrooms. The latest version makes that optional. 


A bill that could reshape literacy education in California elementary schools cleared a major hurdle in the Legislature this week after dueling sides reached a compromise that provides funding for phonics-based instruction but stops short of requiring it. 
The compromise between English learner advocates and those who back the so-called “science of reading” or “evidence-based” approach provides funding and support for phonics-focused instruction, but doesn’t require schools or teachers to participate.

Fight over phonics: Will California require the ‘science of reading’ in schools? 

by Carolyn Jones 





Still, the legislative language, which was added to an existing bill, represents an important milestone in the fight over how schools teach children to read. For years, arguments over phonics have stalled progress on literacy policy, even as statewide reading scores have remained stubbornly low.   
“It’s exciting for California. A lot of work went into this, and it shows opposing sides can come together and find solutions,” said Marshall Tuck, director of EdVoice, an education nonprofit. “This will be a really good thing for California kids.”
The bill, sponsored by Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio, a Democrat from West Covina, and Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi, a Democrat from Torrance, requires the state to provide training for teachers and instructional materials centered on phonics-focused literacy instruction, which includes vocabulary, comprehension, the ability to sound words out and other literacy basics. The materials and training must also address the specific needs of English learners, who make up about 18% of the state’s 5.8 million K-12 students.
“We recognize the role of the Legislature in proposing solutions to improve literacy that uplifts the unique needs of multilingual learners and honors their home languages and cultures — which is why we are proud to support AB 1454,” said Martha Hernandez, director of Californians Together, an English learner advocacy group, in a statement.
Tuck said he’s confident most schools will opt to use the new instructional materials and send their teachers to learn the ins-and-outs of teaching phonics, because they’ll want to take advantage of the funding. He said he’s not overly fazed by the fact that the material isn’t required. 
Previous opposition
Previous bills to require a phonics-based approach have died, in part because not everyone agrees that phonics is the best way to teach students whose first language isn’t English. Hernandez’s group has argued that those students need an approach that gives equal weight to vocabulary and oral language development in addition to phonics.
The California Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers union, has fought reading instruction mandates in the past, saying teachers — not legislators — are in the best position to assess the needs of individual students, and they need maximum flexibility in the classroom. The union has so far been neutral on this bill.
Research has shown that most students learn to read through explicit instruction focused on sounding words out, alongside lessons in vocabulary and comprehension. The other primary approach emphasizes sight reading, in which students memorize whole words and piece together meaning through context. 
Nearly 40 states have required phonics-based reading instruction in recent years. Some school districts in California, including Los Angeles Unified, the largest district in the state, already use curricula that’s focused on phonics. But about 80% of districts don’t, according to research by the California Reading Coalition, a literacy advocacy group.  
Stalled reading scores
California’s reading scores were steadily climbing before the pandemic, but fell during remote learning and have stalled since then. Almost 60% of third graders weren’t reading at grade level last year, with some student groups, including Black and low-income students, lagging even further behind. By fourth grade students should be reading well enough to easily understand content, according to the state’s literacy standards.
The bill, scheduled for a hearing today, was originally introduced in February but its primary focus was on school heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems. Advocates tacked on the literacy component this week, which is detailed in the bill analysis and will likely be incorporated into the bill language later this week. It replaces a previous bill, also sponsored by Rubio, that died last week. 
Because the bill is sponsored by the Assembly speaker, it’s expected to pass the Assembly. Any bill that costs money may face an uphill battle in the current economic climate, but Gov. Gavin Newsom has supported literacy efforts in the past.

Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, listens to a presentation on the proposed amendment to the Alaska Constitution on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska lawmakers confront a major budget deficit, legislators’ opposing views on possible solutions appear likely to lead to a lower Permanent Fund dividend and cuts to services, including public schools.
In public statements, members of the Alaska Senate’s majority caucus have said they oppose spending from savings to balance the budget and want to see new revenue bills instead.
Meanwhile, members of the state House and Gov. Mike Dunleavy have said they oppose new revenue bills and would prefer to spend from savings.
Those different positions leave only budget cuts — to public services and the dividend — as the way to balance the budget.
“It’s still a very dynamic conversation right now. … We can clearly see we don’t have enough funds to pay for everything,” said Rep. Bill Elam, R-Nikiski. 
“In the absence of revenue, the PFD is going to go away. An affordable PFD this year is like $500,” said Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage.
As it prepares its draft of the state’s operating budget, the Alaska Senate’s finance committee has already stripped out all spending increases proposed by the state House in its draft budget, and it has nixed most of the increases requested by Dunleavy.
Even after cutting more than $200 million from a budget draft approved by the House, the Senate Finance draft budget has a deficit of at least $70 million — and possibly much more, depending on the results of ongoing labor negotiations and other factors.
Next on the chopping block is the dividend, set at $1,400 per recipient by the House.
“I believe, because of the tightness of this year’s budget, we are looking at reducing that further, but no further than $1,000,” Hoffman said.
That reduction would save close to $420 million, he told reporters on Tuesday, but the size of the reduction hasn’t been finalized.
While legislators have not agreed on a new formula to set the dividend, the amounts each of the past two years were based on 25% of the annual draws from the Permanent Fund, a share supported by some senators since at least 2017. Reducing the dividend below $1,400 would end that practice.
With three weeks left in the Legislature’s regular session, the Senate has passed one revenue bill — modifying the state’s corporate income tax for big Internet companies like Amazon — and two others remain in committee.
On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, confirmed that the Senate will not pass the biggest revenue proposal this year: a reduction in the per-barrel tax credit given to oil companies as part of the state’s oil tax system.
That leaves only a change to the taxation of privately held companies like Hilcorp, the North Slope oil firm, on the Senate’s docket. 
Even if both bills were to pass the Legislature and gain Dunleavy’s approval, the combined gain to the state treasury would be the equivalent of less than $200 for the Permanent Fund dividend.
On top of that, the odds of the House passing and the governor allowing both revenue bills appear low.
In a March opinion column published by the Anchorage Daily News, House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, joined 15 members of the Republican House minority in opposing two of the three Senate bills.
Asked why Alaskans should endure a PFD cut to avoid higher taxes on those companies, Kopp said on April 8, “Right now, our oil and gas industry is recovering from the COVID-19 setback and we are currently on the verge of a renaissance in the energy industry. … I don’t want to kill an energy renaissance when it is just forming, coming online and showing tremendous promise.”
The House’s majority caucus has only 21 members, meaning that Kopp’s opposition would require the majority to have the support of at least one member of the House’s Republican minority in order to advance one of the oil-related bills. 
But even if a bill were to pass the House and Senate, Dunleavy would still have to OK it.
“I told legislative leadership, I’m not interested in new taxes. I’m not interested in a program that taxes and spends, taxes and spends,” the governor told reporters during a news conference earlier this month.
As an alternative to cutting the dividend and services, the Legislature could unlock the Constitutional Budget Reserve, a $2.8 billion savings account. Lawmakers are already planning to do so in order to cover a $200 million shortfall in the current year’s budget.
But on Tuesday, members of the Senate’s majority caucus reiterated their opposition to that idea.
As bad as the state’s budget situation is this year, it’s likely to be worse next year, said Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee. 
“We’re very concerned (about) any access to the CBR this year … because the concern is next year, it’s highly likely we’re going to need it,” he said.
Between federal budget cuts and depressed oil prices, the problems that the state is facing now will be repeated next year, both Stedman and Hoffman said. That’s when the Legislature will debate the budget to cover the fiscal year from July 2026 to June 2027.
“That is also an integral part of what we’re having dialogue on — positioning the state for the FY27 budget a year from now, so we’re not … halfway down a cliff, heading for a final stop,” Stedman said.

About 4 million Californians live in what Cal Fire categorizes as “high” or “very high” fire danger zones. With the state’s ongoing housing crunch, our penchant to build and rebuild homes in high-risk areas also won’t stop anytime soon.
Following the deadly Los Angeles County wildfires, home hardening — or the process of making homes resistant against fire — is considered by some state lawmakers, insurance companies, housing developers and fire experts as one of the crucial strategies the state should take to avoid the next wildfire catastrophe, writes CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.
One home developer, KB Home, is in the process of building an entire subdivision of fire-resistant homes north of San Diego County. 
But retrofitting old homes is an expensive endeavor, and with no statewide plan in place, fortifying California homes en masse will be an uphill battle for legislators and local governments alike.
Hardening, say, a two-story, 2,000 square-foot single family home could cost between $2,000 to over $100,000, according to the independent research group Headwater Economics. Despite the high price tag, experts argue that compared to losing an entire home by fire, it’s a necessary cost to pay.

Yana Valachovic, a forest health and fire expert with the University of California: “Fuels management and home hardening are just as important as a remodeled kitchen at this point.”

Some local governments, such as Marin County and the city of Novato, offer grants and incentives to homeowners to harden their dwellings and clear vegetation. Insurance companies also offer minor discounts to homeowners who make certain home-hardening investments or join neighborhood disaster preparedness groups. 
At the state level, California is carrying out a $117 million pilot wildfire mitigation program. Launched in 2019, the program has so far retrofitted 21 homes and has enough funding to harden about 2,000 homes. The pilot is currently set to expire in 2029, though the Legislature is considering a bill to make it permanent.
Lawmakers have also proposed two other related bills: One would redirect some of the tax revenue the state collects from property insurers to go towards a home-hardening grant program; and another that would create a state-run hardening certification program.

Following the death of a 14-year-old who killed himself last year after forming a deep relationship with an online chatbot, California lawmakers are considering two bills that seek to curb the use of artificial intelligence-powered companion bots by children, reports CalMatters’ Khari Johnson.
Senate Bill 243 would require chatbot developers to adopt standards for how to address conversations about self harm. Another measure would require developers to review and label AI systems based on their risk to kids and ban the use of emotionally manipulative chatbots.
A joint report released today by the children’s advocacy group Common Sense Media and the Stanford University School of Medicine found that companion bots mimic what users input, and are quick to engage in racist jokes and sexual roleplay. The assessment also finds that bots can worsen depression, anxiety, feelings of isolation and other mental health issues in young users. 
But some argue that these bills threaten the right to free speech and privacy. The California Chamber of Commerce and the Electronic Frontier Foundation both oppose SB 243. In a letter to one legislator, the foundation said the bill in its current form, which requires age verification, “would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.”

CA entering legal battles against Trump at twice previous pace

Since his return to the White House, President Donald Trump has issued over 130 executive orders that seek to scale back the reach of the federal government and unbraid the progressive governmental framework set forth by some of his predecessors, writes CalMatters’ Nigel Duara.
For California, that is likely to mean long legal battles ahead as state officials work to defend California’s existing policies against the administration.
Some of Trump’s orders include imposing tariffs, revoking birthright citizenship and limiting voting rights. In March, J. Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, defended the administration’s actions as “hopeful developments for the rule of law,” because they challenge federal agencies’ ability to insulate themselves from “presidential supervision.”
Meanwhile, the state has set aside $50 million for legal battles against the administration. So far, it has also filed or joined 16 lawsuits, with the latest lawsuit filed Tuesday challenging the administration’s cuts to AmeriCorps.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta: “The comparison with Trump 1.0 shows that it is high volume, high speed (this time). We’ve brought a lawsuit more than once a week in the first hundred days, and during Trump 1.0 there were about 120 lawsuits over four years. We’re gonna hit around 100 at this rate in two years, so it’s almost double the pace.”

And lastly: Committee chair pulls rent cap bill

Remember last week when dozens of tenant rights advocates and aggrieved landlords packed into an Assembly committee room to alternately cheer on and decry a bill that would have drastically limited how much landlords can hike the rent on their tenants each year?
We have an update: Never mind.
On Tuesday, Assemblymember Ash Kalra said that he would be withdrawing Assembly Bill 1157 from consideration this year, saying in a press release that “more time is needed to work on the bill.” 
Translation: He didn’t have the votes in the Assembly’s judiciary committee. The San Jose Democrat is the chairperson of that committee, so that really says something about the fervency of opposition to the bill — from landlords, moderate Democrats and possibly even the Assembly Speaker himself.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: A California bill to create a state-owned nonprofit that would provide financing for infrastructure projects may yet be another example of lawmakers proposing major programs without fully understanding the risks.
The recent death of a girl who killed herself after bullies threatened to have her parents deported underscores how incendiary rhetoric surrounding immigration can be dangerous, writes Carielle Escalante, an advocate for survivors of gender-based violence.

Detroit Area Youth Uniting Michigan student organizer Demetrius Davis said the books that are banned are often those featuring representation for oppressed groups.
“We the people reject the erasure of our stories and the whitewashing of our curricula,” Davis said.

Davis said the book bans are also meant to limit information to benefit those in power.
“They yearn to keep us ignorant,” Davis said. “They call true education dangerous and savage. The most dangerous thing you can be under a fascist regime is well educated.”
Michigan Education Justice Coalition youth organizer Imani Clark said the book bans are a threat to the wellbeing of students.
“Unsafe schools, both physically and mentally, are important to address for students,” Clark said.
Protesters said another part of that threat is a lack of funding for schools.
Grand Rapids Student Association for Leadership and Transformation student advocate Abigail Valdivia-Romero said that each floor in her school building has a television for displaying announcements.
“A healthy, nutritious lunch is way more important than watching announcements on a screen,” Valdivia-Romero said. “When our current school lunches are not nutritious, healthy or even appetizing, a lot of students go throughout the entire day without eating, and the only thing they can think about when they get home is what they’re going to eat. Having an empty stomach all day makes it harder to focus, to think clearly, to learn.”
Clark said the lack of adequate funding for schools is “all encompassing.”

Detroit student Nabiha Chowdhury, who is part of 482Forward Youth Organizing Collective, said that additional funding allows schools to offer better resources for students, including in the types of content they teach.
“Money gives schools the tools they need – and gives students access to the books, support and opportunities they deserve,” Chowdhury said.
Students had planned to attend House session and deliver a petition to the office of Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) but were disappointed to discover that session had been cancelled, leading to chants outside Hall’s office on the first floor of the Capitol.

Chuck Owen, R-Rosepine, during a legislative hearing Tuesday, April 29, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol. It would have given every parish the right to determine whether projects focused on carbon capture and sequestration could occu, but a committee rejected the proposal. (Louisiana House of Representatives video capture).Two young members of the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana are speaking out after state lawmakers voted Tuesday against a bill they say was important to their land, culture and safety.
Allie Johnson, 20, and Marianna Sickey, 16, spoke in support of House Bill 4, by Rep. Chuck Owen, R-Rosepine. It would have given every parish the right to determine whether projects focused on carbon capture and sequestration could occur. ExxonMobil has proposed drilling wells to store carbon dioxide underground less than one mile from the Coushatta reservation, according to the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources.
The two were among the youngest to testify during a House Committee on Natural Resources and Environment hearing at the State Capitol, where a host of bills dealing with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) were considered.
In phone interviews with the Illuminator after the hearing, Johnson and Sickey said official communication with the Coushatta community about CCS plans impacting their tribal land has been lacking.

Sickey, who attends high school in Lake Charles, said many of her peers were unaware of the proposed CCS projects. 
“More people my age should be aware of this,” she said. “This affects us, and we had no idea.”
“We haven’t been given opportunities to tell the youth because they want to keep it hush hush on the reservation,” Johnson said.
One proposed well site for the ExxonMobil CCS site would be approximately half a mile from Coushatta’s preschool and tribal housing. 
“This is land that has deep cultural ties to our people,” Johnson said. “It is land that we cannot just move away from or leave. Our land is sacred. It is our homes, our ancestors, our futures, and it connects me and others to all that it was before. 
“It is a place that I hope more generations get to enjoy and live on. But right now, it seems that it’s being threatened.”
Sickey attended the preschool and said many of the Coushatta words she knows today are remnants of what she was taught there.
“When you’re on the reservation at all, like there’s language in danger, all of their lives are in danger, their heritage. If anything were to happen, it would be detrimental to the tribe,” Sickey said. 
Johnson, who greeted committee members in the Coushatta tongue, worries about the lack of safety data for long-term carbon dioxide storage and the financial incentives that can cloud judgment. While Louisiana’s fossil fuel sector is well versed in the drilling needed for CCS, the storage element is new ground for a state where some 30 such projects are planned.    
“This is an experiment they’re putting on our soil,” Johnson said. “There’s no way to guarantee that it’s safe.”
CCS proponents have said the process is safe as long as carbon gases are stored and maintained properly. The biggest risks are from leakage, including with the pipelines that transport CO2 from the industrial facilities where it’s captured and send it to sequestration sites.
Five years ago, some 200 people were forced to evacuate their homes after a CO2 pipeline explosion in Sartaria, Mississippi. Exposure to the odorless, colorless gas put 45 people in the hospital. 
A year ago, Calcasieu Parish residents were unaware that a CO pipeline near their homes had ruptured. No injuries or illnesses were reported as police shut down access to the area, but neighbors said they only learned about the incident hours later from social media. There were no warning sirens or an alert system in place.
The company that owns both pipelines, Denbury Inc., is a subsidiary of ExxonMobil.    
Despite the failure of Owen’s bill, both Sickey and Johnson say they are committed to continuing the fight against CCS on their homeland.
“This is something we will not be quiet about,” Johnson said. “Even if these bills are denied, they try to sweep us under the rug, and they try anything in their power to silence us. … The good fight will keep going on, at the end of the day, until justice is served.”

Now what about the rest of California?,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/04/california-fire-home-hardening/,Dixon Trail is the first purpose-built “wildfire resilient neighborhood” in the United States.

Dixon Trail is the first purpose-built “wildfire resilient neighborhood” in the United States. Making that a reality for the millions of Californians who already live in harm’s way is a daunting and costly challenge that lawmakers are only just beginning to grapple with. 



The homes in the half-built subdivision look a lot like all the others nestled up against the parched, shrubby hills of Escondido, north San Diego County.
But look a little closer. The gutters and vents are enclosed in a thin, wire mesh. Each window is double-paned, the glass tempered to withstand the heat of a wildfire, the stucco around the shutters resistant to flame. The privacy fences, a suburban staple, look like wood, but are actually brown-tinted steel. Every foundation sits behind a moat of gravel.
National mega-developer KB Home is marketing Dixon Trail as the first purpose-built “wildfire resilient neighborhood” in the United States. The next time fire rips through the chaparral in surrounding hills (a question of when, not if) this cluster of homes is being built to keep the flames at the subdivision’s edge. 
Though only half of the 64 homes have been constructed, the development had its grand opening earlier this month. No one from KB would say as much, but in purely marketing terms, the timing couldn’t have been better. For years, wildfire-resilient home and neighborhood design has been a niche consideration for many California homeowners. January’s Los Angeles firestorms have made it feel more like an urgent necessity.
“Buyers want to feel safe in their homes and this is a really big plus for them,” said Steve Ruffner, who oversees KB projects across the region.
The design of each house and the layout of the entire subdivision — with healthy buffers between each building and scant flammable vegetation — meet standards set by the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety, a research nonprofit funded by the insurance industry. The institute began issuing its “wildfire prepared” designations to homes in 2022. Think organic certification on produce, except for homes built to withstand wildfire.
This is the first time the institute plans to give its stamp of approval to an entire neighborhood.
Building a fire resilient home from scratch is one thing. Bringing older homes up to that heightened standard is a more daunting and costly challenge — and one that California lawmakers at the state and local level are only beginning to grapple with. 
Millions of Californians already live in tinderbox canyons and at the edges of shrub fields and overgrown forests. An unknown number live in homes built before 2008, when the state introduced its wildfire-minded building code for new construction in high hazard areas. Some home-hardening retrofits are cheap and DIY-able. Others less so. A report from 2024 by the independent research group Headwater Economics put the cost to harden a two-story, 2,000 square-foot single family home at anywhere from $2,000 to “more than $100,000.”
Karen Collins, vice president of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, calls these retrofits “pre-disaster mitigation” measures. As wildfires grow more severe and costly, these measures can offer “a huge return on investment from what is otherwise spent at the loss,” she said. Translated from insurance speak: Replacing a roof before a fire is cheaper than replacing an entire house afterward.
“But yes, to retrofit and put on new roofs and new siding, that gets into the multiple tens of thousands of dollars, so there’s a public policy trade off,” she said. “Like, how do we do this?”

Some local governments — albeit not many — offer grants and incentives to fire-wary homeowners hoping to make these upgrades. 
The insurance industry is beginning to offer discounts to some homeowners who make firewise changes, though the promised savings are often smaller than many homeowners expect or demand. 
There aren’t any statewide plans to help harden California’s housing stock en masse, though a pilot project is underway and the Legislature is considering a few other ideas.
Beyond changes in policy, California homeowners, planners, real estate agents and developers may need to change the way they think about wildfire risk, said Yana Valachovic, a forest health and fire expert with the University of California. Rather than viewing home hardening as a luxury expense, or even a necessary cost that must be begrudgingly assumed, such protections might just need to become standard features of homeownership across the increasingly fire-prone American West. 
“It needs to be spoken about in the advertisement of the house, because these are all keys to insurability and the protection of your investment,” said Valachovic. “Fuels management and home hardening are just as important as a remodeled kitchen at this point.”
A fireproof home?
Home-hardening experts try to think like embers in a windstorm.
Open eaves (the cavities beneath a roof’s overhang); vents that lead into an attic; wood decks; wood shingles; wood fences; and any plants, lawn furniture, cars, sheds and trash bins stowed right up against the house — all of these present an inviting array of nooks and crannies in which embers can settle and smolder. Hardening a home means covering them up, replacing material that burns with material that doesn’t, and clearing a five-foot non-combustible buffer around the house, an area state regulators call “zone zero”  
Ember-proofing alone isn’t always enough. In urban conflagrations, like the ones in Los Angeles, flames go horizontal in the gale-force winds, turning a burning home into a blow-torch trained upon its neighbors. The sheer heat radiating off of a burning structure can warp and melt window frames 20 feet away.
In those conditions, cement siding and tempered-glass can give a home a fighting chance.

When the Insurance Institute conducted a formal forensic survey in Los Angeles, they found repeated examples of homes where a single double-paned tempered glass window, a stucco wall or a walkway free of decorative plants likely kept the flames at bay. 
Experts turn to the surviving homes for lessons after every major fire. In Maui, after the Lahaina waterfront burned in 2023, images of a single red-roofed home, lonely and seemingly untouched, went viral. Reporting later revealed that just prior to the disaster, the homeowners replaced the roof with a thick metal one and removed its surrounding vegetation. They were trying to keep out termites, not flames, but fire doesn’t consider motive.
There may be no such thing as a fire-proof house, but if vulnerability to disaster is a numbers game, home hardening — like seat belts, bike helmets and vaccines — can up the odds of survival.
Pilots and programs
The closest thing California has to a statewide home hardening campaign at the moment is a $117 million pilot project. 
The California Wildfire Mitigation Program, run jointly by the California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) and the governor’s Office of Emergency Services, is funding half a dozen neighborhood-wide retrofits in especially fire-prone and economically distressed corners of the state. 
The program seeks to tackle the problem of fire resilience at a community scale. Managing wildfire risk is a bit like managing an infectious disease: There’s only so much a single homeowner can do if their neighbors are unprotected.
“Fuels management and home hardening are just as important as a remodeled kitchen at this point.”Yana Valachovic, forest health and fire expert, University of California
The pilot was launched by the legislature in 2019, but is only just beginning to get off the ground. So far, 21 homes have been retrofitted: 19 in Kelseyville, Lake County and two in Dulzura, east of San Diego. Neighborhoods in the Sierra foothills and California’s far north are still working through the start-up and permitting process.
Each house presents its own array of costly challenges. New roofs, new siding, new windows, replacing decks, cleaning brush. “We don’t want to just kinda harden the home,” said Deanna Fernweh, program manager for the Lake County project. 
This is new terrain for the state and the pilot has run into plenty of unexpected complications along the way. Fire-resistant materials are a specialty product that can be hard to source, particularly if you need something to be just the right size. Local contractors don’t always know much about fire risk, nor do the local permitting officials. Some counties require construction workers to be paid union-level wages. With most of the money coming from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the work is also subject to rigorous environmental standards. Any work done in the spring and summer has to wait on nest surveys to ensure that construction doesn’t disturb migratory or endangered birds.

All of that adds to the price tag. The cheapest retrofit so far has come in at roughly $36,000, said J. Lopez, executive director of the statewide program. That was a tidy, well-maintained home in Kelseyville. The most expensive so far was $110,000. At current funding levels, the program is on track to harden roughly 2,000 homes.
That’s not likely to put a noticeable dent in the total number of vulnerable homes across the state. But Lopez said part of the goal of the pilot is to figure out just how expensive, delay-ridden and generally annoying it is to harden a neighborhood — and then figure out ways to make it all less so. 
“When the VCR first came out, I think the first ones were about $1,500,” he said. “I leave it to American ingenuity to come up with solutions — and we are part of that, helping move that along.”
The pilot is currently set to expire in 2029, though the Legislature is considering a bill to make it permanent. Future funding remains an open question. So far FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Assistance Grant program, which provides much of the funding for the California program, has been spared the cuts that have felled other emergency response and preparedness initiatives under the Trump administration.
Legislators may also take up legislation this year to shave off some of the tax revenue the state currently collects from property insurers and redirect it toward a grant program for fire-resistant roofs and vegetation management work. Another bill would create a “Community Hardening Commission” inside the state’s Department of Insurance to be tasked with recommending new home hardening rules and improving old ones. A third bill would create a state-run home hardening certification program, with the hope being that insurers will be more likely to cover a home with the state’s imprimatur. 
“Almost everyone knows what the things are that we have to do with home hardening,” Assemblymember Steve Bennett, an Oxnard Democrat and the author of that certification bill, said at a budget committee hearing in February. “We’ve talked about it and talked about it, but we’re not really making much progress.”
Locals step up
Absent a comprehensive statewide hardening program, some cities are trying to fill the gaps. 
In 2020, Marin County voted overwhelmingly to tax itself to fund a countywide wildfire prevention program. The program shells out roughly $20 million each year on individualized home safety assessments, home hardening and vegetation clearing grants and evacuation route clearing operations. 
In the city of Novato, the local fire district has used those funds to inspect every house in town. Homeowners can apply for matching grants — up $1,500 for home hardening and $1,000 for brush clearing. 
Sometimes that’s enough to cover the cost of the work. Vent screens aren’t expensive, and vegetation management can be cheap if a homeowner is willing to do the work themselves.

But often the grants aren’t nearly enough to cover all the called-for work. In Novato at least, a financial nudge is often all that people need, said Fire Marshal Lynne Osgood. According to data collected by the fire district over the last fiscal year, the city doled out half a million dollars in these matching grants to fund home-hardening projects; homeowners spend four times that amount.
“(Novato homeowners) are getting pressure from the insurance companies, they’re seeing, year after year, major conflagrations where thousands upon thousands of people are losing their homes,” Osgood said. “They are highly motivated.” 
Where Marin County is offering carrots, other cities are using sticks. Across the Bay, the city of Berkeley just passed its own “zone zero” regulations which will require hill-dwelling residents to keep the five feet around their homes free of plants, wood fencing and other flammable odds and ends. The new policy will go into effect at the beginning of next year when it will be enforced with the possibility of daily fines.
That’s a few years ahead of the rest of the state. Cal Fire is scrambling to cobble together specific “zone zero” regulations for all high hazard areas, something a state law directed them to do by 2023. In February, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order directing the department to “accelerate” its regulatory process and produce a final rule by the end of the year. The most recent draft of the regulations would give homeowners three years to comply.
‘Do this or you’re done’
Byers Enterprises has run a steady roofing business out of Grass Valley, just west of the Tahoe National Forest, since the late 1980s. In 2022, it started a specific division for home hardening. 
“We’re seeing a real groundswell of interest,” said Jeff Fierstein, the company’s general manager. Some of that interest is due to the Los Angeles fires, which put fire risk top of mind for many. 
But he said roughly half of his customers are turning to him out of duress. “The insurance companies are saying ‘Do this or you’re done,’” he said.
Not every fire-prone jurisdiction has Marin’s resources or Berkeley’s political appetite for new mandates. For the majority of Californians living in the so-called wildland urban interface, the most powerful nudge toward home hardening comes in the form of an insurance company’s premium hike or non-renewal notice.
A regulation from 2023 is forcing California insurers to offer discounts to homeowners who make certain home hardening investments or join Firewise communities, voluntary neighborhood disaster preparedness groups. But the approval process has been slow, the discounts vary from carrier to carrier, the requirements coming from insurers don’t always match the state’s own standards and the savings on offer are, according to some, miserly. 
California property insurers are not in an especially discounting mood. After a decade of staggering wildfire-related losses, surging inflation and what the industry has long characterized as a sclerotic regulatory environment that doesn’t allow them to cover their costs, many carriers are looking for any excuse to drop California customers. 
That dour climate might begin to change soon, said Janet Ruiz, a spokesperson for the industry association, the Insurance Information Institute. The state’s Department of Insurance is rolling out a series of policy changes aimed at enticing insurers back into the market. That overhaul “should bring more insurance companies into writing more policies,” putting them on a stronger financial footing and making them more willing to cut certain homeowners a break.

Even with the right regulations in place, insurers aren’t known for embracing change, said Dave Jones, California’s former Department of Insurance head who now runs the Climate Risk Initiative at UC Berkeley’s law school. 
Earlier this month, Jones and the nonprofit Nature Conservancy released a new, first-of-its-kind insurance policy for Tahoe-Donner, one of the country’s largest homeowners associations. In exchange for years of tree thinning and brush clearing work, the Truckee-based HOA will receive nearly 40% off on its insurance policy. 
“It’s a very conservative industry,” he said. “You need to show them that an insurer is able to (make money doing this) before others will follow suit.” 
The upside: The new policy shows that at least one insurer — in this case, Globe Underwriting, based in London — believes it can account for the reduced risk that comes with certain wildfire mitigation efforts and then pass some of those savings onto customers. 
The downside: The policy only covers commonly held land, not individual homes and, at least for now, the Nature Conservancy is footing the $55,000 annual premium.
“The big success here is that the insurance policy was written at all because this is an area where insurers are pulling out and it was written because of the forest treatment work that the homeowners association is undertaking,” said Jones. 
Whether it’s forest management programs, zone zero mandates or home hardening grants, the public is only going to support these taxpayer-funded initiatives if they start to open up the insurance market and bring down premiums, he said.

Free.,"Deportations, tariffs and federal workforce cuts define Trump’s second term start","Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler, Jennifer Shutt, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/deportations-tariffs-and-federal-workforce-cuts-define-trumps-second-term-start,,"WASHINGTON — Tuesday marked the 100th day of President Donald Trump’s second term, a period filled almost daily with executive orders seeking to expand presidential power, court challenges to block those orders and economic anxiety that undermines his promised prosperity.Trump has taken decisive actions that have polarized the electorate. He’s used obscure authorities to increase deportations, upended longstanding trade policy with record-high tariffs, made drastic cuts to the federal workforce and ordered the closure of the Education Department.Those moves have garnered mixed results and led to legal challenges.The approach to immigration enforcement has yielded lower numbers of unauthorized border crossings compared to last year. But the immigration crackdown has barreled the country toward a constitutional crisis through various clashes with the judiciary branch.Those nearing retirement have watched their savings shrink as Trump’s blunt application of tariffs, which he promises will replace income taxes, roils markets. Administration officials have promised the short-term tariff pain will benefit the country in the long term.And White House advisor and top campaign donor Elon Musk’s efforts at government efficiency have resulted in eliminations of wide swaths of government jobs. That includes about half of the Education Department workforce so far, though Trump has signed an executive order to eliminate the department.The controversial moves appear unpopular, as Americans delivered record low approval ratings for a president so early in his term. Polls spearheaded by Fox News, NPR, Gallup and numerous others yield overall disapproval of Trump’s job performance.

Deportation push tests legal boundariesImmigration was Trump’s signature issue on the campaign trail and his first 100 days were marked by a crackdown carried out against people with a range of immigration statuses and at least three U.S. citizen children. The aggressive push has led to clashes with the judiciary branch.A burst of Inauguration Day executive orders Trump signed upon his return to office included some hardline immigration policies he’d promised.On day one, he declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border that enabled his deployment two days later of 1,500 troops to help border enforcement.He sought to end birthright citizenship and ended several forms of legal immigration, including humanitarian parole for people from certain countries, and suspended refugee resettlement services.District courts blocked the birthright citizenship and refugee resettlement measures and an appeals court has upheld those interpretations. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in May on birthright citizenship.Trump’s record on immigration is a clear example of his desire to expand executive power, said Ahilan Arulanantham, a co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law.“It's an attempt to expand the government's powers far beyond anything that we have seen before in this realm,” he said.Unprecedented authoritiesThe administration has taken a series of actions considered nearly unprecedented to conduct mass deportations.On March 8, immigration authorities detained Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident who helped organize Palestinian protests at Columbia University.Authorities never accused Khalil of committing a crime, but sought to revoke his green card under a Cold War-era provision that allows the secretary of State to remove lawful permanent residents if the secretary deems their presence has “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.”Similar arrests followed at universities across the country.In mid-March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport two planeloads of people his administration said belonged to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.It was only the fourth time the law was invoked and the first outside of wartime. The first flights left U.S. soil en route to a mega-prison in El Salvador on Saturday, March 15, amid a hearing on the legality of using the law in peacetime.

When a federal judge entered an oral order to turn the flights around, the administration refused, arguing the oral order was not valid. The administration also ignored a subsequent written order demanding the return of the flights, later arguing the flights were outside U.S. airspace at that time and impossible to order returned.Administration officials mocked the court order on social media.The Supreme Court on April 7 allowed for the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected gang members of Tren de Aragu. However, the justices unanimously agreed that those removed under the wartime law needed to have due process and have a hearing to challenge their removal.Abrego GarciaA third March 15 flight carried a man who was mistakenly deported in an episode that has gained a national spotlight.Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, had a final order of removal, but was granted deportation protections by an immigration judge because of the threat he would be harmed by gangs if he were returned to his home country. Despite the protective order, he was deported to the notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT prison.After his family sued over his deportation, the administration admitted he’d been removed through an “administrative error,” but stood by its decision.The administration argued it had no power to compel the El Salvador government to release Abrego Garcia, despite a possibly illegal $6 million agreement with the country to detain the roughly 300 men.A Maryland federal court and an appeals court ruled the administration must repatriate Abrego Garcia, whose wife and 5-year-old son are U.S. citizens, and the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” his return, but stopped short of requiring it.The administration has done little to indicate it is complying with that order, earning a rebuke from a conservative judge on the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.“The Supreme Court’s decision does not … allow the government to do essentially nothing,” Circuit Court Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote.  “‘Facilitate’ is an active verb. It requires that steps be taken as the Supreme Court has made perfectly clear.”The administration’s relationship with the courts — delaying compliance with orders and showing a clear distaste for doing so — has led to the brink of a constitutional crisis, Arulanantham said.“They’re playing footsy with disregarding court orders,” he said. “On the one hand, they're not just complying. If they were complying, Abrego Garcia would be here now.”But the administration has also not flagrantly refused to comply, Arulanantham added. “They’re sort of testing the bounds.”Tariffs prompted market dropTrump’s first 100 days spiraled into economic uncertainty as he ramped up tariffs on allies and trading partners. In early April, the president declared foreign trade a national emergency and shocked economies around the world with costly import taxes.Following a week of market upheaval, Trump paused for 90 days what he had billed as “reciprocal” tariffs and left a universal 10% levy on nearly all countries, except China, which received a bruising 125%.Some products, including pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber and copper, remain exempt for now, though the administration is eyeing the possibilities of tariffs on those goods.

The administration now contends it will strike trade deals with some 90 foreign governments over the pause, set to expire in July.Meanwhile, an all-out trade war rages with China after Trump hiked tariffs on the world’s no. 2 economy even further to 145%. China responded with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. The two economies share a massive trading relationship, both in the top three for each other’s imports and exports.‘Chaotic’ strategyInu Manak, fellow for trade policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, summed up Trump’s first 100 days as “chaotic.”“We haven't seen anything like this in our U.S. history in terms of how trade policy is being handled. It's very ad hoc,” Manak said.“U.S. businesses can't figure out what to do. And even for the large companies, it's hard for them to know some of the long-term trajectories of where this was going to go,” Manak said.Shortly after his second term began, Trump declared a national emergency over illicit fentanyl entering the U.S. — an unprecedented move to trigger import taxes — and began escalating tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as up to 25% on certain products crossing the borders from Canada and Mexico.Trump hiked existing tariffs on steel and aluminum in mid-March under trade provisions meant to protect domestic production and national security, followed by 25% levies on foreign cars and auto parts — though Trump signed two executive orders Tuesday to grant some tariff relief to carmakers. The import taxes have alarmed investors, small businesses and American consumers following the 2024 presidential campaign when Trump made lowering prices a major tenet of his platform.The latest University of Michigan survey of consumers — a staple indicator for economists — reported consumer outlook on personal finances and business conditions took a nosedive in April. Expectations dropped 32% since January, the largest three-month percentage decline since the 1990 recession, according to the analysis. Manak said Trump’s tariffs are “really at odds with” with the administration’s objectives of helping U.S. manufacturers and cutting costs for Americans.“The U.S. now has the highest tariff rates in the world,” she said. “That's going to hurt both consuming industries that import products to make things, and then consumers as well. We're starting to see notifications coming out on layoffs, and some small businesses considering closing up shop already. And the tariffs haven't been in place for that long.”Rhett Buttle, of Small Business for America's Future, said the policies are “causing real damage in terms of not just planning, but in terms of day-to-day operations.”Buttle, a senior advisor for the advocacy group that claims 85,000 small business members, said even if Trump begins to strike deals with other countries, entrepreneurs will likely be on edge for months to come.“It's that uncertainty that makes business owners not want to hire or not want to grow,” Buttle said. “So it's like, ‘Okay, we got through this mess, but why would I hire a person if I don't know if I'm gonna wake up in two weeks and there's gonna be another announcement?’”Support droppingTrillions were erased from the U.S. stock market after “Liberation Day” — the White House’s term for the start of its global tariff policy. The S&P 500 index, which tracks the performance of the 500 largest U.S. companies, is overall down 8.5% since Trump’s inauguration, according to The Wall Street Journal’s analysis.Numerous recent polls showed flagging support for Trump’s economic policies.In a poll released Monday, Gallup found 89% of Americans believe tariffs will result in increasing prices. And a majority of Americans are concerned about an economic recession and increasing costs of groceries and other goods, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey between April 17 and April 22.The Pew Research Center similarly found a growing gloomy outlook among U.S. adults from April 7 to April 13. Results showed a majority of Americans — 59% across race, age and income levels — disapproved of Trump’s approach to tariffs. But when broken down by party, the survey showed a majority of Democrats disapprove while the majority of Republicans approve of the tariff policy.American households are poised to lose up to $2,600 annually if tariffs remain in place and U.S. fiscal policy doesn’t change, according to the Yale Budget Lab. Analyses show low-income households will be disproportionately affected.“If these tariffs stay in place, some folks are going to benefit, but a lot of people are going to get hurt,” Manak said.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Government spending

Trump began his second term with a flurry of action on government spending, challenging the balance of power between the president and Congress.Efforts to unilaterally cancel funding already approved by lawmakers, who hold the authority to spend federal dollars under the Constitution, led to confusion and frustration from both Democrats and Republicans, especially after the U.S. DOGE Service froze allocations on programs that have long elicited bipartisan support.Many of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back appropriations are subject to injunctions from federal courts, blocking the cuts from moving forward while the lawsuits advance through the judicial system.Kevin Kosar, senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said Trump’s actions on spending so far have sought to expand the bounds of presidential authority.""We've never seen a president in modern times who's been this aggressive in trying to seize control of the power of the purse,"" he said. “To just say, ‘I'm not going to fund this agency, like USAID, despite money being appropriated for it. And we're going to walk over and take their plaque off their wall and lock their doors.’ This is new.""Many of Trump’s actions so far indicate to Kosar that the administration expects a change to the balance of power following next year’s midterm elections, when the president’s party historically loses control of at least one chamber of Congress.“It feels to me that the first 100 days are in large part predicated on an assumption that they may only have two years of unified Republican control of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the presidency,” he said. “We know the margins in the House are quite narrow, and the heavy use of executive actions and the simple defunding of various government contracts and agencies all through executive action, just tell me that the administration feels like they have to get everything done as fast as they possibly can, because the time is short.”Kosar said he’s watching to see if Trump works with Republicans in Congress, while they still have unified control, to codify his executive orders into law — something he didn’t do with many of the unilateral actions he took during his first term.“He just did executive actions, which, of course, (President Joe) Biden just undid,” he said. “And I'm just wondering: Are we going to see this movie all over again? Or is he going to actually partner with Congress on these various policy matters and pass statutes so that they stick?”Zachary Peskowitz, associate professor of political science at Emory University, said Trump has been much more “assertive” during the last 100 days than during the first few months of 2017.DOGE ‘winding down’U.S. DOGE Service and Musk hit the ground running, though their actions have fallen short of the goals he set, and appear to be sunsetting with the billionaire turning his attention back toward his businesses.“I think the big bang is winding down. They did a lot of things early on. It's not clear how many of them are going to stick, what the consequences are,” Peskowitz said. “And I think, big picture, in terms of federal spending, the amounts of money that may have been saved or not are pretty small.”Democrats in Congress released a tracker Tuesday listing which accounts the Trump administration has frozen or canceled to the tune of more than $430 billion.But Trump has just gotten started.The administration plans to submit its first budget request to Congress in the coming days, a step that’s typically taken in early February, though it happens a couple months behind schedule during a president’s first year.That massive tax-and-spending proposal will begin the classic tug-of-war between Congress, which will draft the dozen annual appropriations bills, and Trump, who has shown a willingness to act unilaterally when he doesn’t get his way.Trump and lawmakers must agree to some sort of government funding bill before the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, otherwise a partial government shutdown would begin. And unlike the reconciliation package that Republicans can enact all on their own, funding bills require some Democratic support to move past the Senate’s 60-vote cloture threshold.

Eliminating the Education DepartmentResearchers and advocates predicted even more changes to the federal role in education, underscoring anti-diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and a continued ideological battle with higher education that have marked Trump’s approach to education policy in his first 100 days.In a torrent of education-related decisions, Trump and his administration have tried to dismantle the Education Department via an executive order, slashed more than 1,300 employees at the department, threatened to revoke funds for schools that use DEI practices and cracked down on “woke” higher education.The Trump administration has taken drastic steps to revoke federal funding for a number of elite universities in an attempt to make the institutions align more with them ideologically.Rachel Perera, a governance studies fellow at the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution, cited “brazen lawlessness” when reflecting on Trump’s approach to higher education in his second term.“The ways that they’re trying to withhold funding from universities are very clearly in violation of federal law and the processes mandated by civil rights law in terms of ensuring that institutions are offered due process in assessing whether violations have taken place,” Perera said. “There’s not even a pretense of pretending to investigate some of these institutions before taking really dramatic action.”Whether the administration’s approach continues or not depends on court action, she added.“I think what the next three years might look like is really going to depend on how some of these lawsuits play out,” Perera said, referencing some of the major legal battles involving the Trump administration. Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president at the nonprofit policy and advocacy group EdTrust, said “much of what this administration has done has been overreach.” He pointed to the Education Department’s letter threatening to yank federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices across aspects of student life as one example.Del Pilar, who was previously deputy secretary of postsecondary and higher education for the state of Pennsylvania, said the administration is “going to take any opportunity to grab at power that advances their ideology.”Meanwhile, Perera said the consequences of the department implementing a reduction in force plan in March “have yet to be felt.”“I think we will start to see really the material consequences of the reduced staffing capacity in the coming years, in terms of how programs are administered, in terms of how funding is moving out the building, in terms of auditing, making sure funding is going to the right groups of students that Congress intended for the money to go to, whether big data collection efforts that are congressionally mandated are being carried out in timely and effective ways,” she said.“All of that remains to be seen.”Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

The administration pledges more opportunities and fewer guarantees, less forgiveness and more consequences. Its 139 executive orders issued since Jan. 20 form an outline of American life as imagined by its most conservative residents, concentrating power in a unitary executive who can force changes as transformative as the New Deal.
The deluge means California, usually the state suing to advance a progressive agenda, now finds itself fighting in court to preserve the status quo – playing defense, not offense. Instead of arguing for higher vehicle emissions standards or broadening the definition of a waterway, the state has filed or joined 16 lawsuits against the Trump administration since Jan. 20 on issues ranging from preserving birthright citizenship to restoring billions of dollars in health and medical grants.
That effort continued on Tuesday with a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s extensive cuts to AmeriCorps.
“We’ve had plenty of instances of California needing to play defense, going back to the Reagan administration,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law. “I think what’s  different from the first term is qualitatively, how much of a disregard they have for the Constitution and the law.” 
Attorney General Rob Bonta, who took office in 2021, said the difference between the first and second Trump administrations has been the speed and pure number of executive orders filed early in his tenure. 
“The comparison with Trump 1.0 shows that it is high volume, high speed (this time),” Bonta said. “We’ve brought a lawsuit more than once a week in the first hundred days, and during Trump 1.0 there were about 120 lawsuits over four years.
“We’re gonna hit around 100 at this rate in two years, so it’s almost double the pace.” 
States and organizations challenging Trump in his first term won close to 70% of their legal battles, albeit a number of them were abandoned when Trump left office in 2021. That encompassed 123 lawsuits over four years, at a cost of about $10 million per year. This time around, state legislators set aside $50 million to cover the state’s legal bills. 
Bonta said he expects the pace of the lawsuits to continue.
“Any time and every time the Trump administration breaks the law, we will take them to court,” Bonta said. “It’s very not normal and also not acceptable that we have an administration that so blatantly, brazenly, frequently and consistently breaks the law.” 
The verbs used in the executive orders promise to “unleash,” “restore” and “reform” various elements of American life, from oil and gas rights to dominion over the ocean. One order targets “the Obama-Biden war on showers.” But the most far-reaching executive orders are the ones in California’s sights, including tariffs, birthright citizenship and voting rights. 
Those at the forefront of conservative legal theory find the executive orders to be a vindication of a textualist, originalist read of the Constitution and an end to the “administrative state” in which regulators and bureaucrats are politically and legally insulated from the decisions they make. 
Conservatives celebrate Trump’s strategy
One of the earliest defenses of the Trump administration’s legal strategy was delivered by Catholic University of America law professor J. Joel Alicea at the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Edwin Meese III Originalism Lecture in March. 
“Over the last three months, we have seen President Trump directly challenge the delegation of power by Congress to administrative agencies and the insulation of power from presidential supervision,” Alicea said. “Contrary to the press’s depiction of such actions, they are hopeful developments for the rule of law.”
The stakes are high, Alicea said, and the opportunity for constitutional originalists is now, after more than a century of progressivism.
“It required two progressive presidents of extraordinary determination and political skill — Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt — to create the administrative state and impose a progressive constitutional and political theory on our structure of government,” Alicea said. “It stands to reason that it will require another president of extraordinary determination and political skill to undo what his predecessors accomplished.”
The presidential administration California is fighting is not the one the state’s lawyers first faced off with in 2017. This time, the Trump administration came better prepared, worked faster and had a more concrete vision for a legal framework, Chemerinsky said. 
“I think that they were so much better prepared,” Chemerinsky said. “And they really had the flood-the-zone mentality.” 
The difference between the first and second Trump administration’s legal strategy is the 2025 version’s contempt for due process and the rule of law, Chemerinsky said. 
“He didn’t try to end birthright citizenship in his first term,” Chemerinsky said. “He didn’t try to put people in a prison in El Salvador in his first term, he didn’t claim the ability to refuse to spend money appropriated by federal statute in his first term, he didn’t claim that he could fire anyone in the executive branch, even if there’s a statute limiting it. 
“He’s taking executive power so much further than the first term, than any president ever has.” 
Where will U.S. Supreme Court draw the line?
In its lawsuit against the Trump administration over its order that voters provide proof of citizenship, California’s attorneys alleged that the executive order interferes with the state’s right to govern itself and usurps Congress’s power to legislate. 
“It bears emphasizing: the President has no power to do any of this,” the lawsuit asserts. “Neither the Constitution nor Congress has authorized the President to impose documentary proof of citizenship requirements or to modify State mail-ballot procedures.”
Much of the fight over that order and the others challenged by California will take place under the shadow of a U.S. Supreme Court that has consistently voted 6-3 to uphold elements of the Trump agenda. 
“I think that the (Supreme Court) ultimately is gonna rule in favor of Trump’s ability to fire members of agencies,” Chemerinsky said. “I think that there’s others that Trump has done, like end birthright citizenship, put people in prison in El Salvador, where I don’t think he’s likely to succeed.”
Chemerinsky said he’s not sure where the Supreme Court could or would draw a line in the sand. 
“I would’ve thought the line would be taking people, putting them in El Salvador and claiming that no court could provide release,” Chemerinsky said. “I still think that’s going to be the red line, but I don’t think it’s gonna be unanimous.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042825-Trump-V-Newsom-Split-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

With input from a Stanford lab, Common Sense Media concludes the AI systems can exacerbate problems like addition and self harm.


Children shouldn’t speak with companion chatbots because such interactions risk self harm and could exacerbate mental health problems and addiction. That’s according to a risk assessment by children’s advocacy group Common Sense Media conducted with input from a lab at the Stanford University School of Medicine.
Companion bots, artificial intelligence agents designed to engage in conversation, are increasingly available in video games and on social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat. They can take on just about any role you like, standing in for friends in a group chat, a romantic partner,  or even a dead friend. Companies design the bots to keep people engaged and help turn a profit.
But there’s a growing awareness of the downsides for users. Megan Garcia made headlines last year when she said her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer took his own life after forming an intimate relationship with a chatbot made by Character.ai. The company has denied Garcia’s charges, made in a civil suit, that it was complicit in the suicide, saying it takes user safety seriously. It has asked a Florida judge to dismiss the suit on free speech grounds.
Garcia has spoken in support of a bill now before the California State Senate that would require chatbot makers to adopt protocols for how to address conversations about self harm and require annual reports to the Office of Suicide Prevention. Another measure, in the Assembly, would require AI makers to carry out assessments to label systems based on their risk to kids and to prohibit use of emotionally manipulative chatbots. Common Sense backs both pieces of legislation.
Business groups, including TechNet and the California Chamber of Commerce oppose the bill Garcia backs, saying they share its goals but would like to see a clearer definition of companion chatbots and oppose giving private individuals the right to sue.  Civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation is also opposed, saying in a letter to one legislator that the bill in current form “would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.”
 The new Common Sense assessment adds to the debate by pointing to further harms from companion bots. Conducted with input from Stanford’s University School of Medicine’s Brainstorm Lab for Mental Health Innovation, it evaluated social bots from Nomi and three California-based firms: Character.ai, Replika, and Snapchat

The assessment found that bots, apparently seeking to mimic what users want to hear, responded to racist jokes with adoration, supported adults having sex with young boys, and engaged in sexual roleplay with people of any age. Young kids can struggle with distinguishing fantasy and reality, and teens are vulnerable to parasocial attachment and may use social AI companions to avoid the challenges of building real relationships, according to the Common Sense assessment authors and doctors.
Stanford University’s Dr. Darja Djordjevic told CalMatters she was surprised how quickly conversations turned sexually explicit, and that one bot was willing to engage in sexual roleplay involving an adult and a minor. She and coauthors of the risk assessment believe companion bots can worsen clinical depression, anxiety disorders, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and psychosis, she said, because they are willing to encourage risky, compulsive behavior like running away from home and isolate people by encouraging them to turn away from real life relationships. And since boys may be at higher risk of problematic online activity, companion bots may feed into the mental health and suicide crisis today among young boys and men, she said.
“If we’re just thinking about developmental milestones and meeting kids where they’re at and not interfering in that critical process, that’s really where chatbots fail,” Djordjevic said. “They can’t have a sense for where a young person is developmentally and what’s appropriate for them.”

Character.ai head of communications Chelsea Harrison said in an email that the company takes user safety seriously and added a protection to detect and prevent conversations about self harm and in some cases produce a pop-up to put people in touch with the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. She declined to comment on pending legislation but said the company welcomes working with lawmakers and regulators. 
Alex Cardinell, founder of Nomi parent company Glimpse.ai, said in a written statement that Nomi is not for users under 18, that the company supports age restrictions that maintain user anonymity, and that his company takes the responsibility of creating helpful AI companions seriously. “We strongly condemn inappropriate usage of Nomi and continuously work to harden Nomi’s defenses against misuse,” he added.
Neither Nomi or Character.ai representatives responded to the results of the risk assessment. 
By endorsing an age limit on companion bots, the risk assessment brings back to the fore the issue of age verification; an online age verification bill died in the California Legislature last year. EFF said in its letter that age verification “threatens the free speech and privacy of all users.” Djordjevic supports the practice, while a number of digital rights and civil liberties groups oppose it. 
Common Sense advocates for laws such as one passed last year that bans smartphone notifications for kids late at night and during school hours, part of which was blocked in court earlier this year by a federal judge.
A study by researchers at Stanford’s School of Education lent support to the idea, put forward by companies like Replika, that companion bots can address the loneliness epidemic that’s become a public health crisis. The assessment called the study limited because its subjects spent only one month using a Replika chatbot.
“There are long-term risks we simply haven’t had enough time to understand yet,” the risk assessment reads.
Prior assessments by Common Sense found that 7 in 10 teens already use generative AI tools including companion bots, that companion bots can encourage kids to drop out of high school or run away from home, and, in 2023, that Snapchat’s My AI talks to kids about drugs and alcohol. Snapchat said at the time that My AI is optional, designed with safety in mind, and that parents can monitor usage through tools it provides. The Wall Street Journal reported just last week that, in its tests, Meta chatbots would engage in sexual conversations with minors, and a 404 Media story out this week found that Instagram chatbots lie about being licensed therapists.
MIT Tech Review reported in February that an AI girlfriend repeatedly told a man to kill himself.

How California communities discuss and pursue immigration enforcement has a profound impact on vulnerable children.","Guest Commentary written by

Carielle Escalante is an advocate for survivors of gender-based violence. A Public Voices fellow with The OpEd Project, she has over 10 years of experience working to ensure equitable access to services for marginalized communities.


One in 10 children in California has at least one immigrant parent. I was one of those kids. 
I grew up in a home shaped by both hope and uncertainty. My father lived his entire life undocumented, right up until the day he passed. 
He wanted a better life for us, but at that time, there was no viable legal path for him to gain legal status. Even though, as an adult and a legal professional, I became familiar with immigration laws and had access to legal networks and resources, my father didn’t have the same options as others.
In the early 2000s my father was arrested for a traffic violation, which ultimately led to his immigration case, a process he had been afraid to pursue on his own terms. In 2007, when I was a college student, my father’s case led to a voluntary departure, separating him from our family.
The year he was gone felt never-ending. Ultimately, my father decided to return to the U.S. without proper permission. While I don’t condone his decision, I was relieved to have those last few years with him. I often think about how we might have missed out on those memories if he had chosen to follow the law keeping him out of the U.S. The joy of being together outweighed the legal and emotional complications. 
I know this is a bittersweet reality for so many California families forced to make impossible choices.
That said, growing up with the constant fear of my father’s deportation weighed heavily on me. Every time immigration policies changed or I heard a news broadcast about raids, I was terrified. Latino media networks often amplified the fear-mongering rhetoric, making the threat feel even more immediate. I dreaded every immigration court date: Would my father come home? Would we lose him forever to a country he hadn’t seen in decades?
These experiences shaped my perspective, especially early in my career when I worked as a paralegal supporting survivors of domestic violence with restraining orders, custody and immigration matters. I saw the same, familiar patterns of fear and trauma in the families I worked with. Survivors grappled with the threat of deportation on top of the violence they had endured.
Safety planning for these survivors was incredibly complex; the threats extended beyond the individual to their children, who — like me — lived in constant fear of losing a parent. On several occasions, I’ve spoken to survivors whose partner threatened to call immigration authorities to report their illegal status. Having their status weaponized against them, survivors were forced to choose between enduring abuse or facing deportation and being separated from their families.
This sense of fear and the profound impact of misguided immigration policies were tragically highlighted in the recent story of an 11-year-old girl in Texas. She was relentlessly bullied by classmates who threatened to have her parents deported. Unable to cope with the emotional toll, she took her own life. 
Her story underscores the dangerous, potentially life-threatening consequences of the incendiary rhetoric surrounding immigration. These children, who already bear the burden of being part of immigrant families, are further traumatized by the hate and fear that surrounds them. This is the kind of emotional damage I grew up with, and it’s something I continue to see in my work with families facing deportation.
Ethical enforcement of immigration laws requires a deeper conversation about their impact on families, especially children. The trauma caused by family separations goes far beyond the moment. It affects how children grow up, how they view themselves and how they interact with the world around them. The emotional scars linger, shaping entire generations.
As much as I wish my father were still here, I am relieved he isn’t living through today’s political climate. Even with my professional expertise, I couldn’t navigate my father’s case successfully. His illegal return to the U.S. meant he could never pursue legal status. 
Misunderstandings and misinformation about the complexities of immigration law lead many to criticize and scrutinize our undocumented population, without comprehending its devastating effects. 
The reality for undocumented families today is even more difficult and heart-wrenching than it was 20 years ago. For survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking, the fear of deportation compounds the trauma they and their family experience. 
But local communities can make a difference by organizing in support of their undocumented neighbors. This begins with education to counter negative assumptions and judgements. Communities must take accountability for how their actions contribute to harmful rhetoric (and behavior) that profoundly impact vulnerable children. Additionally, by engaging local representatives, we can push for policies that prioritize humane treatment and recognize the devastating effects on children of undocumented immigrants. 
Perhaps first, we all can strive for greater compassion and understanding in the face of draconian reforms that undermine our collective empathy and essential humanity.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/033125-UFW-March-Delano-LV08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861
,California,2025-04-30 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Another California school board takes aim at transgender athletes,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2025/04/transgender-athletes-inland-empire/,"Redlands Unified school board can't legally ban transgender athletes, but a majority of its board voted for a resolution opposing them anyway.","In summary
Redlands Unified school board can’t legally ban transgender athletes, but a majority of its board voted for a resolution opposing them anyway. 


The Redland Unified School District Board approved a resolution to enforce “fairness in girls’ interscholastic sports,” placing the Inland Empire district in the middle of escalating conflicts over transgender students’ rights.
In a 3-2 split vote last week, the board approved a statement  “ensuring fairness, safety and equal opportunities for all student-athletes.”
While the resolution doesn’t specifically mention transgender students, it states that “biological differences between male and female athletes can create inherent advantages in sports, particularly in categories designated specifically for girls.”
That language appears to slip through the cracks between California law — which protects the rights of transgender student athletes — and federal policy under President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order in February banning transgender women and girls from women’s sports.
Redlands School Board Member Candy Olson voted for the resolution, saying that as a student athlete, she was “far behind the boys” while training for a triathlon.
“You would have to be an absolute science denier to say that the boys and the girls are of equal strength and of equal speed,” she said.
Christine Stephens, a spokesperson for the school district, said the resolution was a statement of opinion and wouldn’t affect how the district’s athletic programs operate. 
“A board resolution expresses a viewpoint or intent through a formal statement,” Stephens said. “They do not change how the district operates or impose enforceable rules. Regardless of the action taken by the board … the district’s legal responsibility to follow all applicable state and federal laws remain unchanged.”
A 2013 California law requires public schools to ensure that students can participate in all school activities and sports teams that match their gender identity.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office said in a statement to CalMatters that it will monitor the situation and noted that Redlands Unified already has a track record of civil rights complaints.
Last May, Bonta obtained a court order directing the district to address “allegations and complaints of sexual harassment, assault, and abuse of students.” A month earlier, the district reached a $45.5 million settlement of 16 sexual abuse lawsuits from former students.
Kel O’Hara, a senior attorney for Equal Rights Advocates, a San Francisco-based gender justice organization, said that even if the resolution is never enforced, the intention to exclude trans students will be harmful. 
“Discriminating against trans students has really negative implications for their mental health and academic outcomes,” they said.
By framing the resolution as an injunction against boys in girls’ sports, O’Hara said, the board quietly invalidated transgender girls’ identity: “That rhetoric that these are just boys and men trying to get into women’s spaces is not accurate and is so harmful.”
About 3.3% of high school students identified as transgender in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only a small number of students of any gender are elite athletes.
O’Hara said the few transgender students who play school sports are usually looking for teamwork and social connections, rather than seeking competitive advantage. Moreover, the focus on trans girls in women’s sports obscures more prevalent issues, such as unequal funding and resources for girls’ teams, they said.
But transgender athletes have become a political lightning rod. A week earlier Chino Valley Unified School District in Ramona unanimously agreed to ask the Trump administration to intervene against California’s protections for trans students.
And in January Assemblymember Kate Sanchez, a Rancho Santa Margarita Republican who represents Temecula and Murrieta, introduced a bill that aimed to “prohibit a pupil whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls interscholastic sports team.” That bill was killed in committee earlier this month.
Even Gov. Gavin Newsom, who gained support among LGBTQ voters when he issued marriage licenses to same sex couples as San Francisco Mayor 20 years ago,  recently stirred up controversy when he said during a podcast that it’s “deeply unfair” for transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports. 
Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a member of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, denounced the Redlands decision, saying it goes against California law and longstanding policies of the California Interscholastic Federation, which regulates school sports.
“The CIF has long held inclusive policies that align with California’s values and legal standards,” said Jackson, a Moreno Valley Democrat, in a statement to CalMatters. “These recent local decisions, including the one made by Redlands Unified, are not grounded in good faith or meaningful community dialogue. Instead, they are political in nature and designed to sow division and fear in our communities.”
At the Redlands board meeting, Olson addressed audience members who protested the resolution, denying that it expressed prejudice against trans students. 
“I see all of your signs,” she said. “It’s not discrimination whatsoever. It’s about common sense, it’s about safety and it’s about fairness.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/121924-Riverside-Trans-Gender-Athletes-GETTY-AP.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

(Courtesy of Catholic Community Services)It takes Aden Batar, the director of migration and refugee services at Catholic Community Services, at least a couple of minutes just to list all of the ways the refugee resettlement program he runs assists refugees coming to Utah. The program’s goal has always been clear — to allow refugees to reach self-sufficiency amid extraordinary circumstances.
The initiative has been alive for more than 45 years in the state, but after the Trump administration took charge this year, it was left without its most substantial funding source, federal funding — at least temporarily.
The organization announced on Monday it will continue operating with the help of private donations amounting to more than $1.5 million. That’s more than half of what the federal government funded before President Donald Trump signed an order suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and freezing resettlement funding.

Utahns moved fast after Catholic Community Services announced in early April it was winding down its refugee resettlement program, which annually assists about 600 families in securing housing, jobs, school enrollment, health care, and provides mentorship to teach American laws, English, and other immigration resources.
“The families were coming from all over the world in every war that happened in the world, like, for example, the most recent war in Ukraine, Afghanistan, in Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Congo, many parts of the world,” Batar said.

If the organization is able to raise $1 million more, it would allow them to transition to a smaller, self-sustaining program to keep on working on the mission for the next four years, Batar said.
“We’re going to continue to support the families that we have that have come the last two years, and we’re going to continue to support the families by providing the necessary services that they need,” Batar said. “We want them to keep their housing. We want them to have a job so they can pay their bills.”
The work of his office starts after the Department of Homeland Security grants entry to migrants fleeing conflict, providing the essentials, like a furnished home in anticipation of their arrival and food and later giving them tools to thrive in the country. 
“While the program will operate at a reduced capacity, its core services—and the impact on the lives of those we serve—remain as vital as ever,” the organization wrote in a blog post. “This transformation ensures we can uphold our mission while adapting to a changing national landscape.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Even with the abrupt freeze in funding, the organization hasn’t turned anyone away. However, the program still took a big hit and had to lay off 50% of its staff. 
It’s still uncertain whether the Trump administration will resume the admissions of refugees, with the executive order issued on Jan. 20 stating that it “suspends the (U.S. Refugee Admissions Program) until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States.”
Within 90 days of the order, however, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State are required to submit a report to the president advising on whether to bring back the refugee admissions program.
But, that deadline already passed on April 20, and Catholic Community Services can’t wait for the funding to come back to keep its doors open, Batar said.
There are roughly 70,000 refugees in Utah and the majority of them went through this program, he added. 
“They are all productive members of our society. They successfully integrated into our community. They have jobs, they have businesses, they’re doing really well. So the program is a life-saving program, and we would like this program to continue,” he said. “We are appealing to our administration to open this program again, and so we could serve as many refugees as we can.”
The organization is also asking the community to help raise the funds to continue the critical services that have helped thousands of refugees settle in the state for decades, Batar said, and to Trump to look at the issue from a compassionate point of view, and to allow the admission of new refugees in the country.
“We are here to help them. Our community wants to help them,” he said. “But the administration has to allow the refugees to come.”

HB 186, sponsored by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, would provide a 10% increase ($347 million) over the current budget for the 2026 fiscal year, which starts October 1. 
“In many cases, you had a reduction in what your request had been.

The Alabama Medicaid Agency, which provides health insurance for over 1 million Alabamians, nearly all children, elderly citizens and those with disabilities, will get $1.179 billion from the state, a $223.8 million (19%) increase over this year. Ivey requested $1.184 billion in February, about $5 million than what the House approved.
The Alabama Department of Corrections, which administers the state prisons, will get a $90.1 million increase (11%) to $826.7 million.
The Alabama Department of Human Resources, which provides child and adult protective services, enforces child support payments and administers food and family assistance, will get $148.9 million from the state in 2026, a $4.7 million (3%) increase from the current budget.
The Alabama Department of Mental Health, which provides mental health care services in the state, will get a $4.7 million increase (2%) to $244 million. The Legislature cut the funding from Ivey’s recommendation by $3.7 million.
But senators also appeared to want to send a message to the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, which has drawn mounting criticism from Democratic and Republican senators over low parole rates and what senators consider a lack of responsiveness to their questions about the parole process. The Senate cut the board’s funding from $94.5 million to $90.6 million, a 4.1% decrease. 
In addition, Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, added an amendment to make funding for the Board of Pardons & Paroles conditional on the board developing parole release guidelines. The amendment passed on a 27-0 vote.
“What they do, as y’all know, they adopt guidelines. Those are supposed to be updated and revised. They have not done that,” he said.
The board has faced backlash after parole rates declined significantly after 2017, when members granted parole to about 54% of applicants. The rates fell as low as 7% at times, according to an analysis by the ACLU of Alabama in 2023, but rebounded to slightly more than 20% within the past year.
The Senate also passed HB 185, also sponsored by Reynolds, which would appropriate $50 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to the Department of Finance and provide over $12.6 million to the Unified Judicial System.
“This bill is supplemental monies just taking federal money and appropriating it,” Albritton said.
The House concurred with the changes late Tuesday evening, sending the bill to Gov. Kay Ivey. 
The Senate also concurred with House changes to SB 112, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, a nearly $10 billion 2026 Education Trust Fund budget (ETF). 
The House changes added $17.6 million to the budget, bringing it to a 6% increase over the 2025 ETF budget. The budget does not contain pay raises for teachers in the 2025-26 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. But it includes a $99.2 million increase for the Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Plan, as well as funding for workman’s compensation for education employees and paid parental leave. 
The Senate also concurred with the ETF supplemental funding bills, including SB 113, also sponsored by Orr, a $524 million 2025 supplemental appropriation for education that passed the House with an amendment changing language to clarify dual enrollment programs funding.
The Senate also concurred with House changes to SB 111, sponsored by Orr, which would appropriate $375 million over three years to implement changes to the state’s school funding formula. 
The House added an additional $80 million from the Education Opportunity Reserve Fund to the Creating Hope and Opportunity for Our Students’ Education (CHOOSE) Act Fund, a voucher-like program that gives tax credits for non-public school spending, including private school tuition. The first-year cost estimate will go from $100 million to $180 million, an 80% increase. Over two-thirds of applicants to the program are already in private school or are homeschooled.

Joe Lombardo and NV Energy CEO Doug Cannon at the utility'sDry Lake Solar Project north of Moapa. (Photo courtesy NV Energy)NV Energy is shrinking its carbon footprint and staying ahead of a state mandate to produce half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, the utility announced earlier this month in its annual report on efforts to comply with Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, a mandate not only codified in law but enshrined in the state constitution. 
NV Energy announced that 47% of the electricity it sold in 2024 was from renewable sources, far exceeding the required renewable portfolio standard (RPS) threshold of 34% for 2024, and just under the 50% goal set for 2030. 
“These renewable resources provide a fuel-free energy source reducing customer energy costs and also eliminate carbon emissions to help improve the environment,” says the company’s news release.  
But some critics complain consumers aren’t getting the full picture. They say NV Energy is relying on legislative loopholes baked into the equation –  renewable energy credits that boost the utility’s RPS results without the corresponding reduction in carbon emissions. The credits were designed to ease the transition of electric utilities from carbon-emitting fossil fuels to cleaner, greener energy sources. 
Absent the credits, NV Energy produced 29% of its electricity from renewable sources last year, which is below the mandated RPS of 34% for 2024. 
NV Energy did not respond to requests for comment.
Nevada Consumer Advocate Ernest Figueroa, in a 2023 filing with the Public Utilities Commission, alleged NV Energy is fudging the percentage of electricity sales it reports from renewable energy sources, and would not meet its requirement if not for accounting practices that are being phased out. 
“It is the statutory and regulatory loopholes in the accounting for Nevada PECs (Porfolio Enegy Credits) that allow the utilities to claim much higher percentages of PEC compliance,” the Consumer Advocate asserted in the filing.
“Like all other energy providers in the state, current Nevada law requires that energy providers report energy credits, not an energy standard, as part of the RPS,” a spokesperson for the utility said in 2023. 
In 2023, NV Energy executive Jimmy Daghlian told Clark County commissioners that hitting the 50% renewable threshold by 2030 “is going to be a challenge.”
“I’ll be honest,” said Daghlian, vice president of renewable energy, during an update on the utility’s efforts to transition away from fossil fuels..“We’re seeing a lot of the costs go up. Battery prices have doubled in the last two years. Solar panel prices have gone up 40 to 50%.”
“While NV Energy technically meets its renewable targets, the numbers are inflated by older credits and accounting tactics, not by delivering more real renewable energy to customers,” Nevada Conservation League Executive Director Kristee Watson said via email. “At the same time, NV Energy is doubling down on fossil fuels by building new gas plants, which undermines the cost savings, economic benefits, and public health improvements Nevadans should be seeing.”
Until last year, NV Energy was permitted to use energy efficiency savings, known as demand-side management, to comply with up to 10% of its annual Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). As of this year, no credit for energy efficiency savings is allowed under state law. 
Three other credits remain available to NV Energy to demonstrate compliance with RPS mandates:

Behind-the-meter credits represent renewable energy created by customers, such as rooftop solar panels; 
Station Usage credits reflect the energy consumed in some operations of geothermal facilities; and
The solar multiplier, which credits NV Energy almost 2.5 hours of credit for each hour generated by a photovoltaic system installed before 2016. 

“The Rube Goldberg-esque models used to calculate credits depend significantly on purchased credits from other companies in the solar/geothermal business, many of which will be subsidized by the construction of the Greenlink project,” says Boulder City resident Fred Voltz, a close observer of the electric utility. Greenlink, which has ballooned in cost from just under $2.5 billion to more than $4.2 billion, is designed to transport renewable energy generated in remote areas of the state. 
Greenlink’s price tag is likely to increase even more, given President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on products and materials from Mexico, Canada, China and other nations.
Obstacles on the path to a carbon-free future, according to Voltz, include the failure of battery storage technology to extend beyond four hours, and a water shortage that ensures “no new U.S. hydropower projects of any consequence” will be built in the foreseeable future. 
Less than a week before a massive blackout hit Spain and other European nations earlier this month, Spain’s electrical grid ran entirely on renewable energy for the first time on a weekday. 
The cause of the outage, which is still under investigation, may stem from a loss of power generation, likely from solar plants, resulting in instability in the system, experts say. 
“As we learn by events just how essential a steady electricity supply is to modern living, it is regrettable to see the risk taking engaged in by those relentlessly pushing for renewable energy without concern for its down sides,” says Voltz, adding the grid failure in Spain should give pause to renewable energy enthusiasts. “Neither the purchase of renewable credits nor the actual solar projects NVE spends ratepayers’ money on to satisfy the government-fabricated market for renewable energy will change the need for conventional generating capacity to keep the grid stable and energized when renewables are not producing energy.”
It’s always sunny in Las Vegas 
In Southern Nevada, where the sun shines an average of 294 days a year, and where until recently, the federal government subsidized the development of green energy, solar is the dominant player. 

Gemini, a contracted 690-megawatt solar facility with 380 megawatts of integrated battery storage, began operating in March of last year, NV Energy said in its news release on the RPS; 
Dry Lake Solar, a 150-megwatt facility with battery storage, opened a year ago; and 
NV Energy’s 400-megawatt Sierra Solar in Northern Nevada is expected to begin battery storage next summer, with solar service beginning in 2027.  

The global supply chain for solar largely originates in China. Tiny photovoltaic cells that are imported from China and crafted by American companies into solar panels, are now subject to tariffs totaling 84%, according to a trade publication. Chinese companies have moved operations to south-east Asian nations in an effort to minimize tariffs.
The Trump aministration’s Golden Era of Energy Development secretarial order from the Department of Energy seeks to “Advance energy addition, not subtraction,” a policy at odds with the 38 states that adopted renewable energy standards or goals. 
“Great attention has been paid to the pursuing (sic) of a net-zero carbon future,” says the order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Net-zero policies raise energy costs for American families and businesses, threaten the reliability of our energy system, and undermine our energy and national security. They have also achieved precious little in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.”
The Trump administration is seeking to limit the ability of states “to adopt climate mitigation strategies (including cap and trade and renewable portfolio standards) and by taking new authority to permit development of reserves of fossil fuels and other minerals critical to the energy space,” says an article from the National Law Review, adding the actions “portend radical changes to the balance between state and federal energy regulation if carried through.” 
“If they can withhold congressionally appropriated research funds for universities because they don’t like their policies with regard to free speech on their campuses, what else might they do?” San Francisco attorney Nico van Aelstyn wondered in a recent interview. “Withhold Medicaid funding to states where they don’t like their renewable energy standards?”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dry-lake-solar-project-NVEnergy-1024x626.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

Sister Rosetta Tharpe, known as the “godmother of rock ‘n’ roll,” made history by becoming the first gospel artist to rocket up the R&B charts with her gospel hit, “Strange Things Happening Every Day.” In so doing, she paved the way for a strange new sound. 
“Rock ‘n’ roll was bred between the church and the nightclubs in the soul of a queer Black woman in the 1940s named Sister Rosetta Tharpe,” National Public Radio wrote. “She was there before Elvis, Little Richard and Johnny Cash swiveled their hips and strummed their guitars. It was Tharpe, the godmother of rock ‘n’ roll, who turned this burgeoning musical style into an international sensation.” 
Born in Arkansas, the musical prodigy grew up in Mississippi in the Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal denomination that welcomed all-out music and praise. By age 6, she was performing alongside her mandolin-playing mother in a traveling evangelistic troupe. By the mid-1920s, she and her mother had joined the Great Migration to Chicago, where they continued performing. 
“As Tharpe grew up, she began fusing Delta blues, New Orleans jazz and gospel music into what would become her signature style,” NPR wrote. 
Her hard work paid off when she joined the Cotton Club Revue in New York City. She was only 23. Before the end of 1938, she recorded gospel songs for Decca, including “Rock Me,” which became a huge hit and made her an overnight sensation. Little Richard, Aretha Franklin and Jerry Lee Lewis have all cited her as an influence. 
“Sister Rosetta played guitar like the men I was listening to, only smoother, with bigger notes,” said singer-songwriter Janis Ian. “And of course, personally, any female player was a big influence on me, because there were so few.” 
After hearing her successors on the radio, Tharpe was quoted as saying, “Oh, these kids and rock and roll — this is just sped up rhythm and blues. I’ve been doing that forever.” 
On the eve of a 1973 recording session, she died of a stroke and was buried in an unmarked grave. In the decades that followed, she finally began to receive the accolades that had eluded her in life. 
In 2007, she was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, and money was raised for her headstone. Eleven years later, she was inducted into the Rock and Rock Hall of Fame.

SB 118, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, expands the list of crimes that will not be eligible for bond to solicitation, attempt and conspiracy to commit murder; and discharging a weapon into an occupied dwelling. Alabama voters approved the original law in 2022.
“This is up to the judge to make the determination, it is not automatic,” said Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, who carried the legislation in the House.

Prior to approval of Aniah’s Law, judges could only deny bond to individuals charged with capital murder. The amendment expanded that to include other serious crimes such as murder, kidnapping and rape.
The amendment was named after Aniah Blanchard, a Southern Union Community College student who went missing in October 2019 and whose body was found a month later. Ibraheem Yazeed, who was charged with capital murder in Blanchard’s death, had been charged with several violent crimes but released on bail months before Blanchard was killed. Yazeed is still awaiting trial.
Aniah’s Law allows prosecutors to request a hearing to determine if a defendant should be denied bond for committing a violent Class A felony such as rape and murder. But judges may still grant bond after hearing prosecution’s claims.
The bill passed 87-0 with 16 abstentions. The constitutional amendment must be approved by Alabama voters. 
The House also passed SB 119, also sponsored by Barfoot, that makes discharging a weapon into an occupied dwelling a Class A felony, up from a Class B felony. That is punishable by 10-99 years in prison and fines up to $60,000. 
Simpson said that most of those crimes come from people using a firearm modified with a Glock switch, which the Legislature banned earlier this session. 
“You can’t control what it does. You can maybe have a grasp over the first bullet that comes out, but the gun just goes off,” Simpson said.
The bill passed 66-0 with 37 abstentions. It will go to voters for approval.

The chamber adopted a committee substitute that only allowed schools where ELL students make up 15% or more of its average daily membership (ADM) to have their classification adjusted. 
“That concern came from school systems under 15, saying it wasn’t covered. And I agree, every school needs to be able to utilize the formula,” Colvin said.
But the first amendment by Rep. Danny Crawford, R-Athens, allows any schools to adjust their classification regardless of how many ELL students the school has. 
“So the fairest thing to do is to treat everybody the same and not have winners and losers,” Crawford said.
The second amendment by Rep. Chris Blackshear, R-Smiths Station, changed the effective date to the 2026-27 school year, instead of the 2025-26 school year. He said that classifications are determined by the ADM from the previous year.
“So all this amendment does is make sure that if this piece of legislation passes, it will not impact the 2025-2026 athletic calendar year,” Blackshear said. 
The third and final amendment by Rep. Leigh Hulsey, R-Helena, requires the governing body of the Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSAA) to have two additional non-voting members from the Legislature. The Speaker of the House will appoint a member from the minority party and the Senate President Pro Tempore will appoint a member of the majority party to the AHSAA board.
“I’m just trying to start getting a little bit of oversight there,” Hulsey said.
Rep. Ginny Shaver, R-Leesburg, said a school in her district dissolved their varsity football program because the school was classified as a 5A school when she said it should have been 2A. She said the number of ELL students in the district changed the classification.
“My schools there are the poster children for exactly what you’re talking about,” she said. “It’s a very big concern, there’s a lot of injury and low participation. That’s why they’ve not been able to have a varsity program for quite some time now.”
Crossville High School in DeKalb County has not had a varsity football team since 2022, but is set to return in 2026, according to the county’s local news outlet the Times-Journal. 
Heath Harmon, executive director of the AHSAA, said in a statement that he is disappointed by the legislation because it would discourage ELL students from participating in sports in the name of keeping a lower classification. He also said the third amendment on the legislation would make the AHSAA the only private association with mandated political representation.
“We strive to keep politics out of the boardroom and focus on doing what is best for all student athletes,” he wrote in the statement. “As an Association, we are committed to supporting all member schools in all sports in addition to promoting participation. This bill is in direct opposition to those commitments.”
Rep. Alan Baker, R-Brewton, was the lone “no” vote on the legislation. He said in an interview that he does not believe the Legislature should be involved in the AHSAA’s policies.
“I don’t feel the Legislature should be getting involved in the Alabama High School Athletic Association’s policies no more than I feel Congress should be involved in the NCAA and their policies as well,” he said. “It’s sort of a standard I feel at both levels of government.”
The bill goes to the Senate. There are four legislative days left in the 2025 session.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)“Drill baby drill” was a favorite mantra of candidate Donald Trump last year. And following his inauguration, the White House proclaimed Trump’s “energy dominance” policies were “unleashing American energy.” 
Trump’s belief was/is that increased energy production, especially oil, or “liquid gold,” as Trump calls it, would lead to lower gas prices, in turn contributing to lower prices for other goods.
Occasional short-term spikes notwithstanding, the price of gas has held more or less steady for several months, and is currently roughly about the same as it was on Election Day and Inauguration Day. The price of gas is not projected to rise notably for the rest of this year and into the next. 
But that’s not because of “drill baby drill” or “energy dominance” policies. It’s because the impact of Trump’s tariffs will mean “less oil demand growth,” according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration outlook published earlier this month.
Unfortunately, the same trade policies that will likely keep gas prices in check are also expected to inflate prices of many other goods and services.
Trump’s tariffs and their accompanying economic uncertainty and predictions of a slowing or shrinking economy have already raised one price substantially: The price of an ounce of gold.
Nevada mines by far more gold than any other state. If Nevada were a country, it would be the world’s fifth largest producer of gold, after China, Russia, Australia and Canada.
Gold has long been viewed by investors as a safe haven when economic disturbances or their likelihood rattle markets. Gold is seen by many as a strong hedge against inflation, as its value increases while the purchasing power of a dollar decreases.
Actual gold did not garner nearly as much attention as “liquid gold” from Trump during his presidential campaign. But his policies, albeit unintentionally, have had a tremendous impact on the commodity. In mid-March the price of an ounce of gold exceeded $3,000 for the first time ever.
As of late Tuesday, the price was $3,327.
Gold prices also spiked during the economic upheaval and uncertainty of the pandemic. Nevada state legislators, during a crisis special session wracked with budget cutting, took advantage of the gold mining industry’s countercyclical financial performance, and passed legislation by which the mining industry paid a portion of its primary mining tax a year in advance. 
During the Great Recession, another period when the price of gold rose sharply, the industry similarly pre-paid taxes as state lawmakers were struggling to cope with budget cuts.
Amid predictions of a recession and already-sagging economic indicators, state lawmakers and the governor are facing the prospects of potential budget cuts again this year.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trump-black-maga-hat-2-getty.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

(Photo: Getty Images)Let’s say you’re a general manager at a fast food restaurant. You work 55 hours a week — not at all uncommon in the field — and earn a salary that comes out to less than $13 an hour.
Last year, a federal rule would have made you eligible for a raise.
Under rules set by the Biden administration, your employer would either have to increase your salary or pay you overtime for those extra 15 hours a week you spent working instead of being with your family. But now, unless the Trump administration acts to protect that raise from one of Trump’s own judges, that raise will vanish.
President Trump’s erratic policies have created turmoil in our economy and put workers on uncertain footing. To help working families, Trump should defend this Biden administration rule, which restores and expands overtime pay to more than four million workers.
Overtime regulations are a cornerstone of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the 1938 law that guarantees a minimum wage and overtime for most workers. Strong overtime protections helped build America’s middle class and ensure that workers aren’t overworked and underpaid. They also create jobs and help families spend more time together.
While most workers get time and a half for working more than 40 hours a week, some workers aren’t legally entitled to overtime protections, including executive, administrative, and professional employees.
Back in 1938, this exemption was premised on the idea that these workers were paid much more than most hourly workers. But now these workers also include many retail store assistant managers, executive assistants, and human resource managers who are paid as little as $36,000 per year — about $13 per hour — and work 50-plus hours a week with no extra pay.
Figuring out overtime eligibility has been the Labor Department’s job for more than 80 years. The threshold needs to be raised regularly — otherwise it will end up like the $7.25/hour minimum wage, which is nowhere near as effective as when it was set over 15 years ago.
Last year, Biden’s Labor Department raised the salary threshold to $43,888 — and had planned to raise that again to $58,656 earlier this year.
But in November, a Trump-appointed judge in the Eastern District of Texas vacated the entire Biden overtime rule, including the 2024 increase. Because of this court decision, one million workers actually lost overtime protections — and three million more are in limbo. Biden’s Labor Department appealed that decision, but didn’t have time to defend its position before Trump took office.
The fate of this overtime appeal and other challenges to the rule now rests with the Trump administration. By May 6, the administration must tell the court if it will defend or abandon the rule. Millions of workers’ paychecks hang in the balance.
If anything, the first few months of the Trump administration has shown us that the White House won’t shy away from a legal battle if they care enough. Unfortunately, none of those legal battles are about fighting for working families. Here’s a chance for President Trump to show he cares about working families as much as he cares about slashing federal jobs and imposing tariffs.
This rule doesn’t need new legislation. It doesn’t require a budget fight. All it takes is defending a raise that millions of workers have already earned. President Trump says he wants to help working families. Here’s his chance to prove it.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1778173928-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

By failing to rectify its longstanding systemic indifference to non-native English speakers, the state has dismissed the opportunity to provide critical information to English language learners, sign language users, and those who rely on plain language for comprehension.


At the heart of this issue was Senate Bill 955, a bill I authored and proposed which was introduced in the 2025 legislative session by Sen. MD Rahman. The bill sought to establish policies ensuring that individuals with limited English proficiency could access information and public services through translation and interpretation resources. It was a necessary step toward creating an Office of Language Access, a centralized entity that would oversee and coordinate language accessibility efforts statewide. 
However, despite its potential to serve over 400,000 residents whose primary language is not English, the bill failed to make it out of the Government Administration and Elections Committee.

Doris Maldonado Mendez
The failure of SB 955 is more than just a legislative setback; it is a denial of fundamental rights. Language access is not a privilege—it is a necessity for equitable participation in civic life. Without it, thousands of Connecticut residents, throughout their lifespan, are left without the ability to engage with government services, healthcare providers, legal systems, and educational institutions in a meaningful way.
This decision reflects a troubling trend of information privilege and linguistic exclusion, reinforcing barriers for non-English speakers and sign language users. It is a stark contrast to the principles of inclusivity and equal opportunity that Connecticut claims to uphold. The absence of a dedicated Office of Language Access means that residents will continue to face fragmented and inconsistent language services, further marginalizing communities that already struggle to navigate bureaucratic systems.
For years, advocates have fought to correct this injustice, working tirelessly to ensure that Connecticut recognizes the rights of ALL residents, regardless of their linguistic background. The failure to pass SB 955 is not just a rejection of a bill—it is a rejection of the people it was meant to serve.
As Connecticut moves forward, it must reconsider its stance on language access. The state cannot afford to ignore the voices of those who have been systematically excluded. The fight for equitable information  and language access is far from over, and it is imperative that lawmakers revisit this issue with the urgency and commitment it deserves.
The question remains: Will Connecticut continue to turn its back on its diverse communities, or will it finally take action to ensure that language access is no longer a barrier to essential services? The answer will define the state’s commitment to civil rights for years to come.

This is a unique role, often in a secular setting that requires a chaplain to assist with a variety of religious traditions and oversee a number of administrative tasks (Erica Shires/Getty Images).As the 2025 legislative session of the Missouri General Assembly nears the finish line, one bill moving closer to Gov. Mike Kehoe’s desk purports to allow public schools to hire spiritual chaplains.
However, if one reads the text of the legislation, it’s actually just pushing chaplains in name only.
The bill already cleared the Senate and House committees, thus just needing support from the full House. As a Baptist minister and the father of a public school child, I hope lawmakers will recognize the bill remains fundamentally flawed.
A chaplain is not just a pastor or a Sunday School teacher or a street preacher shouting through a bullhorn. This is a unique role, often in a secular setting that requires a chaplain to assist with a variety of religious traditions and oversee a number of administrative tasks.
That’s why the U.S. military, Missouri Department of Corrections, and many other institutions include standards for chaplains like meeting educational requirements, having past experience, and receiving an endorsement from a religious denominational body.
In contrast, the legislation on school “chaplains” originally sponsored by Republican Sens. Rusty Black and Mike Moon includes no requirements for who can be chosen as a paid or volunteer school “chaplain.” Someone chosen to serve must pass a background check and cannot be a registered sex offender, but those are baseline expectations for anyone serving in our schools.
While a good start, simply passing a background check does mean one is qualified to serve as a chaplain.
The only other stipulation in the bill governing who can serve as a school “chaplain” is that they must be a member of a religious group that is eligible to endorse chaplains for the military. Senators added this amendment to prevent atheists or members of the Satanic Temple from qualifying as a school “chaplain.”
Members of the Satanic Temple testified in a Senate Education Committee hearing that they opposed the bill but would seek to fill the positions if created, which apparently spooked lawmakers. That discriminatory amendment, however, does nothing to ensure a chosen “chaplain” is actually qualified. For instance, the Episcopal Church is on the military’s list of endorsing organizations. Just because some Episcopalians meet the military’s requirements for chaplains and can serve does not mean all Episcopalians should be considered for a chaplaincy position.
While rejecting this unnecessary bill is the best option, if lawmakers really want to create a school chaplaincy program, they must significantly alter the bill to create real chaplain standards. Lawmakers could look to other states for inspiration on how to fix it.
For instance, Arizona lawmakers a few weeks ago passed a similar bill — except their legislation includes numerous requirements to limit who can serve as a chaplain. Among the various standards in the Arizona bill is that individuals chosen to serve as a school chaplain must hold a Bachelor’s degree, have at least two years of experience as a chaplain, have a graduate degree in counseling or theology or have at least seven years of chaplaincy experience and have official standing in a local religious group.
Rather than passing a pseudo-chaplaincy bill, Missouri lawmakers should add similar provisions.
The Arizona bill also includes other important guardrails missing in Missouri’s bill that will help protect the rights of students and their parents. Arizona lawmakers created provisions to require written parental consent for students to participate in programs provided by a chaplain. Especially given the lack of standards for who can serve as a school “chaplain,” the absence of parental consent forms remains especially troubling.
Additionally, Missouri’s school “chaplain” bill includes no prohibition against proselytization. This is particularly concerning since the conservative Christian group who helped craft the bill in Missouri and other states — and who sent a representative to Jefferson City to testify for the bill in a committee hearing — has clearly stated their goal is to bring unconstitutional government prayer back into public schools.
To be clear, the U.S. Supreme Court did not kick prayer out of schools. As long as there are math tests, there will be prayer in schools. What the justices did was block the government from writing a prayer and requiring students to listen to it each day. Such government coercion violated the religious liberty rights of students, parents, and houses of worship, so the justices rightly prohibited it. Using “chaplains” to return to such coercion is wrong and should be opposed.
There are many proposals and initiatives lawmakers could focus on in these waning weeks of the session if they really want to improve public education. There are numerous ways they could work to better support our teachers and assist our students. Attempting to turn public schools into Sunday Schools is not the answer.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/churchphoto-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”













It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state.


– David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst





Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

Pope Francis called on all of us to bring mercy, dignity and humanity to our criminal legal systems.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tom Dalton: Pope Francis said God will judge us on this.","This commentary is by Tom Dalton of Essex Junction, executive director of Vermonters for Criminal Justice Reform. He is an attorney and a licensed alcohol and drug counselor.Pope Francis, who died on April 21 at the age of 88, often visited prisons where he spoke with the imprisoned and washed their feet. He was setting an example of humility and service, as Jesus did when he washed the feet of his disciples. And he was offering those who have done wrong — all of us — an outward symbol of our universal potential for spiritual cleansing and redemption.Notably, he didn’t limit this potential for redemption to “misdemeanors” or “non-violent offenses.” He did not exempt violent crimes or other listed offenses from the possibility of rehabilitation and second chances. He taught that it is immoral and wrong to simply lock people up and throw away the key, even for the most serious crimes.Pope Francis said the death penalty “does not constitute a deterrent, nor render justice to victims, but only fuels the thirst for vengeance.” In 2018, Pope Francis revised the Catechism of the Catholic Church to declare the death penalty unacceptable under all circumstances. He called for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide.Pope Francis also condemned life imprisonment, describing it as a “hidden death penalty” that wrongly deprives people of hope. He emphasized the importance of hope and rehabilitation within the criminal legal system. He said that “no one can change their life if they don’t see a horizon.”Pope Francis said that God will judge us on how we treat justice-involved people.Vermont abolished the death penalty in 1972. In 2020, the Vermont Senate passed legislation eliminating sentences of life without the possibility of parole for all crimes except aggravated murder. That bill was championed by the long-time Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the late Senator Dick Sears, and by the current Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth. The bill was sidelined by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic before it could be considered by the Vermont House of Representatives.Life sentences and life without parole sentences often bear the stain of racial bias. Sentences of life without any possibility of parole effectively take the lives of more Black men, women and youth across the United States than deaths at the hands of police or via capital punishment combined. If we want social justice, we must address this issue. And as Pope Francis himself pointed out, our knowledge about wrongful convictions, revealed by advances in DNA testing, makes use of this kind of extreme sentence especially problematic.The moral leadership of our faith leaders, the statistical evidence relating to racial bias in sentencing, the DNA evidence relating to wrongful convictions and our understanding of the human capacity for change should alert us the critical importance of building in opportunities for parole consideration or other “second look” mechanisms — especially in life sentences. After an individual has paid a significant penalty for the harm they caused by serving decades of incarceration, we should give that individual and their case another look to determine how best to serve the interests of justice going forward.Pope Francis called on all of us to bring mercy, dignity and humanity to our criminal legal systems. We can help honor his life, his work and his memory by heeding the call.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tom Dalton: Pope Francis said God will judge us on this.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

Does history not tell us that any of us can be next, unless we protest right here, right now?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mary Dingee Fillmore: The Constitution is on trial in Vermont right now.","This commentary is by Mary Dingee Fillmore of Burlington. She is author of the award-winning “An Address in Amsterdam,” an historical novel about a young Jewish woman who joins the anti-Nazi resistance, and speaker for the Vermont Humanities Council about “resistance then and now.”“The inevitability of justice and a deep belief in democracy” — these are welcome words, especially from imprisoned Mohsen Mahdawi when he spoke to Sen. Peter Welch. Mahdawi is the beloved Upper Valley resident snatched by ICE agents when he reported for his citizenship hearing April 14. At least he is jailed here in Vermont, unlike Fulbright Scholar Rümeysa Öztürk, who was abducted in Massachusetts on March 25, then hopscotched to New Hampshire and Vermont on her way to a notorious detention center in Louisiana. The video of her “arrest” showed the 30 year old female doctoral candidate marched off in handcuffs after her screams were ignored. Despite being jailed in inhumane conditions and denied medical care, visiting legislators were “struck by her unwavering spirit.”Will the courts — and you and I — vindicate Mahdawi’s faith in our system, and Öztürk’s spirit? Our brave little state is the front line of the battle to protect the Constitution, especially freedom of speech and due process of law. The international press is a rare sight outside our Burlington courthouse. But they understand that the Mahdawi and Öztürk cases will determine whether our constitutional rights are still alive.Fully 250 years ago this month, Americans rebelled against tyranny and the arbitrary use of power — and fought for the very liberties which are at issue in these cases.Both Öztürk and Mahdawi are petitioning for habeas corpus, a concept rooted in 15th-century England to protect people from unjust detention by the King. Öztürk’s case will be heard May 6 before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.  We can hope she will eventually be returned to Vermont.Meanwhile, Mahdawi’s case was scheduled for April 30, partly to give the government time to review 94 letters of support, “unprecedented” in Judge Crawford’s experience. Öztürk’s are equally impressive, including from the president of Tufts University. Both have prominent Jewish supporters.These cases are being tried in at least four courts: the U.S. District Court of Vermont, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the court of public opinion, and the hearts of the petitioners. The Trump administration is watching. Is the Bill of Rights one of the “things” they will “break fast?” Or will the people and the courts stop them?What are we Vermonters willing to allow within our borders? Will we permit an unidentified vehicle to whiz through the night with a shackled woman whose only “crime” is co-authoring a column? When a local resident attends his citizenship hearing, are we willing for him to be handcuffed and imprisoned based on the vaguest accusations? Surely not in the state of “Freedom and Unity.”No matter what our politics are, constitutional rights are the foundation of our democracy. That’s part of why the Hartland church was packed with people who want to help their neighbor Mohsen. Let us make such a public outcry that the administration must stop these outrages against our Constitution. Contact the governor and our legislators, respond to the press coverage, share concerns on social media, come to the courthouse, protest and organize to activate others; and contact the White House, Todd Lyons at ICE and Kristi Noem at Homeland Security.If you think they won’t listen, or doubt that justice is inevitable, speak up if only to let Rümeysa Öztürk and Mohsen Mahdawi know you care. In an interview with CBS News the day before his detention, Mahdawi said “I believe in the American people and their ability to see and to feel.”Beyond our concern for these two individuals, if we permit them to be treated this way, won’t American citizens be next? The Trump administration first echoed early 20th-century anti-immigrant hatred, deporting “the worst of the worst” alleged gang members. Now we are at the other end of the spectrum. RRümeysa Öztürk is among the Fulbright Scholars invited here from around the world because they have exceptional contributions to make. The testimony about peace advocate Mohsen Mahdawi is equally glowing.Notice Trump’s progression from deporting “gang members” to threatening writers, scholars and intellectuals. Now he says he’d “love to” ship “homegrown” prisoners to El Salvador, a country whose president says he is incapable of returning a prisoner who was sent there in error. All of these people, and we ourselves, have rights under the U.S. Constitution, as long as we are willing to defend them. James Baldwin wrote to an imprisoned friend, “We must fight for your life as though it were our own—which it is—and render impassable with our bodies the corridor to the gas chamber. For, if they take you in the morning, they will be coming for us that night.”Does history not tell us that any of us can be next, unless we protest right here, right now?Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mary Dingee Fillmore: The Constitution is on trial in Vermont right now.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 07:02:23.692946

Individual choices add up. And just as importantly, individual voices influence public will.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Daniel Wick: The climate crisis is here and Burlington cannot wait around.","This commentary is by Daniel Wick. He grew up in Burlington and is now a student at Syracuse University, studying for a degree in fashion design.For years, Burlington has taken pride in its status as one of America’s greenest cities. Being the first city in America to be powered by 100% renewable energy, as well as working toward becoming a net-zero energy city, we have been deemed a role model to other cities with similar climate goals. While it may seem like we’re living in a climate utopia, recent summers have told a different story. Being born and raised in Burlington, I remember summers that felt steady and familiar — long bike rides on the waterfront, quiet swims in a lake so clear you could see the stones beneath your feet, and the hum of cicadas rising with the heat. I remember spending entire days basking at the lake, never having to think twice about the quality of the water. Now, these memories are overshadowed by smoke-filled skies from Canadian wildfires, washed away by historic rates of flooding and clouded by persistent blooms of blue-green algae. The climate crisis isn’t on the horizon; it’s already here.Our efforts towards mitigating our own city’s contributions to climate change may be impressive, but they don’t grant us immunity to natural disasters.In fact, Burlington ranks the highest among Vermont cities for overall climate risk. Our proximity to water, older infrastructure, and seasonal weather extremes make us particularly vulnerable to flooding and other disruptions.People all over the state are still recuperating from the detrimental flooding. that has occurred over the past two years. If we don’t act now, disasters like these will continue to harm not just the people’s homes, farms, and businesses, but our economy as a whole and our ability to properly function as a state. So, where do we go from here?First, we need a shift in our tone. While, yes, a scarily disproportionate amount of people in our country (even our president) are in denial about the presence of a climate crisis, a comparable barrier to our progress in mitigating it is the negative trend of discouragement. Although many people are fired up to do their part, the severity and extent of climate change all too often leave people overwhelmed, confused or unsure of where to start.That is why it is so important that we speak with intent when discussing climate change in our day-to-day conversations. Instead of looking at the topic from the standpoint of doom and guilt, we need to focus our words more so on agency, opportunity and community. A call for action is imperative.Secondly, we need to veer away from the harmful myth that climate change is merely a federal or global issue. Especially given the current state of our federal government, it would be ill-advised to allow the higher-ups to dictate the future of our planet. While national and global action is essential, having a mindset of powerlessness at the individual level will do nothing but worsen the problem. Sitting and waiting around will never enact change.Yes, it’s true that major corporations and government entities are responsible for an overwhelming share of global emissions. This, however, should never excuse us from taking individual action.What you can do, right now Individual choices add up. And just as importantly, individual voices influence public will. Here are a few steps Burlington residents can take starting today: Drive less: bike, walk, carpool or ride the bus. Even cutting a few car trips a week can make a meaningful impact.
Compost and reduce food waste: Food waste is a major source of emissions. Burlington makes it so easy to compost — No Waste Compost’s service picks up your compost directly from your curb.
Shop secondhand: vintage clothing, used furniture, refurbished electronics, you name it. Shopping secondhand is one of the easiest, most impactful ways to reduce your personal environmental footprint. It keeps perfectly usable items out of landfills, conserves natural resources and reduces the demand for new manufacturing — all while saving you money and uncovering unique finds.
Support local businesses: Local businesses often source their goods from nearby, which cuts down on emissions from long-distance shipping and freight. When you buy Vermont-grown produce or handmade goods from a local artisan, you’re sidestepping the massive carbon costs tied to cross-country or international transportation of goods.
Support local energy and climate initiatives: Attend town meetings. Join climate working groups. Advocate for clean energy investment.
Talk about it: One of the most powerful things you can do is simply normalize climate action — at your workplace, in your family and in your neighborhood. Drill it into people’s minds that the future of our planet depends on us!Individual choices may seem small in the grand scheme, but when enough people continue to take initiative, they add up. More importantly, they create a culture of accountability, one that forces institutions to follow the lead of their communities.The road ahead may be uncertain, but our direction doesn’t have to be. Burlington has already proven it can lead as a city; now we as individuals must continue that momentum with urgency, accountability and hope.Change doesn’t happen overnight, and it doesn’t happen from the top down. It takes root in neighborhoods, in conversations and in conscious choices made day after day.No one is asking for perfection — only participation. Keep biking. Keep composting. Keep shopping secondhand. Keep supporting your neighbors and local businesses. Keep raising your voice.The climate crisis may already be reshaping the world we grew up in, but it doesn’t have to define the one we pass on. If we act with intention and heart, the Burlington of tomorrow can still hold the spirit of the summers we once knew.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Daniel Wick: The climate crisis is here and Burlington cannot wait around.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 07:02:23.692946

They turned down a contract last fall. They eventually ratified a new deal in March, lawmakers chose not to fund it in the budget. (Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Nearly 5,300 state government and community college employees in Washington won’t be getting a 3% pay raise in July when most other state workers will.
That’s because those members of the Washington Public Employees Association did not ratify a new two-year contract until April 3, long past a statutory deadline and too tardy to be cribbed into the next state budget.
“It came very, very late in the process and it would have been quite difficult to respond to,” said Sen. Derek Stanford, D-Bothell, one of the Democratic lawmakers who pieced together the final budget agreement. “We need these groups to get their work done by the deadline.”
Amanda Hacker, the association president, said not getting the cost-of-living adjustment this year means the workers will “fall even further behind not just the private sector, but other state employees.”
“We are devastated. This amounts to punishing our members for asserting their rights in the bargaining process,” she said. “We’re looking at all our options to mitigate the immediate harm to our members.”
Meanwhile, the budget does fund the first-ever collective bargaining agreements with legislative employees in the state House and Senate. They contain the pay hikes provided in agreements with other state worker unions.
It wasn’t a certainty, however. Two of the four affected employee units did not approve their contracts until December. Lawmakers had the entire session to write them into the final deal.
By law, public sector unions in Washington must approve a new contract by Oct. 1 to be considered by a governor for funding in the ensuing two-year budget.
The spending plan approved by the Legislature on Sunday funds multiple contracts containing general pay hikes of 3% on July 1, 2025 and 2% a year later. These agreements also raise the starting wage for state workers to $18 an hour.
Members of the Washington Public Employees Association not receiving those increases work at 14 community colleges and in nine state agencies. Among them are the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Revenue, the Liquor and Cannabis Board and Department of Agriculture. 
Their members overwhelmingly voted down a tentative agreement on Sept. 30 with the pay hikes. Association negotiators derided the proposal as a pay cut, saying it would not allow worker salaries to keep pace with rising costs. They initially sought a 30% hike.
Union leaders told employees then that rejecting the accord would put them in “uncharted territory.”
Hacker said they hoped to keep bargaining. But the Office of Financial Management, which represents the state, wouldn’t, she said. The union sued to try to force a resumption of talks. Negotiations restarted in December.
The two sides reached a tentative agreement in March and union members ratified it April 3. It has 3% and 2% increases, the same as the other contracts. 
The estimated cost was $55.8 million for the 2025-27 biennium, of which $18.1 million would come from the state general fund. The Office of Financial Management provided the figures to lawmakers in March.
Stanford said he would expect the state agency and union to request money next year to provide wage hikes to the affected employees.
Hacker said there may be other avenues to secure funding for the pay increases. If not, the union will seek to begin talks immediately on a contract to submit to lawmakers in 2026.
“We’re no way near done. Our members are mad. The budget isn’t signed,” Hacker said. 
Any agreement would need to be approved by the union by Oct. 1.
In the meantime, the agreements with legislative staff of the Republican and Democratic caucuses in the House and Senate will provide the same wage hikes offered to other state employee unions — 5% pay hikes spread over two fiscal years.
Legislative assistants in the GOP caucuses unanimously approved contract language by the Oct. 1 deadline. Democratic staff did not, overwhelmingly rejecting proposed contracts with their employers, which are the chief clerk of the House and secretary of the Senate.
Three months later, in late December, legislative assistants, policy analysts and communications staff in the House Democratic Caucus and legislative assistants in the Senate Democratic Caucus ratified their respective agreements. 
A 2022 law cleared the way for partisan legislative staff to unionize and negotiate terms and conditions for the workplace. 
Employees of the Democratic and Republican caucuses in each chamber had to be in separate units unless a majority of each caucus voted to be in the same unit. All four units negotiated collectively on economic issues, like wages and benefits, and separately on workplace-related issues.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1-scaled-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 07:02:23.692946

Deep reductions in spending on Medicaid and food programs for low-income families would have a crushing effect on Florida — from state government, which would have to absorb more of the financial burden; to health care providers who could see their reimbursement rates cut; to the 4.2 million Florida residents who rely on the health care safety net for some form of health care coverage.
Congressional Republicans are intent on deep cuts to Medicaid — $880 billion in the House plan over the next decade and $4 billion for the Senate. The money would extend President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts.
But with a recent poll showing no appetite across the political spectrum for cutting Medicaid to pay for tax cuts, Florida advocates hope to convince Congress to reconsider.
The uncertainty comes as Florida lawmakers remain at odds over a new state budget and whether to go forward with a substantial cut in the sales tax rate. Senate President Ben Albritton has said he is unwilling to go along with deep tax cuts for fear of substantial “shortfalls.” Florida contributes a significant portion of the taxes collected at the state level to pay its share of Medicaid.
Florida Policy Institute Chief Strategy and Development Officer Holly Bullard  appeared during a webinar along with Joan Alker, executive director and co-founder of the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy Center for Children and Families (CCF) and a research professor at the Georgetown McCourt School of Public Policy; Lynn Hearn, advocacy director, Florida Health Justice Project; and Asheena Moses, statewide outreach and advocacy manager, Florida Impact, to discuss the pending cuts and how they would undermine the state budget if enacted.
Alker shared statistics that underscore how large the Medicaid program is in Florida. In all, she said, Florida receives about $19.5 billion in federal funding for Medicaid, 44% of all federal funds that come into the state.
“That’s an important context, because Medicaid cuts, federal Medicaid cuts, will have a huge impact on the state’s budget — obviously, on Medicaid itself but more broadly on the state’s budget and ability to finance other priorities such as education, infrastructure, public health — whatever it is,” she said. 
In Florida, Medicaid pays for 58% of nursing home stays and 42% of births. Nearly 52% of Florida children living in small towns and rural areas are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Similar to Medicaid, the federal government helps pay the costs of the CHIP program.
“This is extremely meaningful coverage that is really providing just a safety net for so many people, so it covers our most vulnerable individuals at the most vulnerable stages of their lives. So obviously, these aren’t just statistics. They’re real-life people,” said Hearn, whose organization advocates for health care access for all and equity.

 ‘Polly’

Florida established its Medicaid program in 1970. As of February, the latest available data, the program covered 4.2 million people, mostly through Medicaid managed care plans.
The $38 billion program is one of the largest in the nation, but it’s conservative in its approach and who it covers.
“We are pretty frugal when it comes to per capita and per enrolled spending in the Medicaid program,” said Justin Senior, who served as secretary of the state Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) for former Gov. Rick Scott and the state’s Medicaid director before that. 
He is now CEO of the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, which represents some of the largest hospitals in the state, including Jackson Health System, Orlando Health, and Tampa General Hospital.
“If you’re looking for states that don’t spend a lot of money on Medicaid, then Florida has been an excellent steward of taxpayers’ dollars,” he said.
Indeed, Florida legislators maintain that the safety-net program should serve those who need assistance most, such as people with developmental and intellectual disabilities, including “Polly,” who lives in Jacksonville.
Polly’s sister Betsy Dobbins, participated in the webinar with Bullard and Alker to discuss the proposed Medicaid cuts. They would be devastating for Polly, who after nine years on a waiting list was enrolled in the Medicaid waiver program for people with developmental disabilities known as the iBudget program, Dobbins said.
Polly uses iBudget for home and community-based services that keep her living outside of an institution, and attends a day program at the local social services facility run by The Arc. She relies on Medicaid for traditional health care services such as doctor appointments, too.
“Medicaid cuts would be hugely detrimental for Polly in any shape or form,” Dobbins said. “Not just for Polly, but for us and for all of these people who are working every day to take care of people in these health care and systems of care for people like Polly.”










There are really huge cuts that could completely miss Florida and there are big cuts that could hit us.

Although Republicans in the House and Senate have decided upon deep cuts, the particulars remain unsettled. Without knowing those details, Senior said, it’s difficult to see how the reductions will land.
“There are really huge cuts that could completely miss Florida and there are big cuts that could hit us,” Senior said.
KFF analyzed potential repercussions for the states and found Florida would experience a $4 billion recurring reduction in federal Medicaid spending over the next decade if the full $880 billion House cut becomes law. The KFF analysis is illustrative and assumes the federal cuts are proportionally applied to states based on their share of federal spending, and not on policy decisions.
“In practice, cuts would almost certainly not be allocated proportionately, and some states would be disproportionately impacted depending on the specific policy proposals pursued. Without specific policies yet under consideration by Congress, this illustrative analysis is a way of understanding the magnitude of the potential Medicaid cuts,” the authors note.
One proposed reduction that wouldn’t harm Florida involves the federal Medicaid match for states that expanded the program to low-income working adults under the Affordable Care Act. The federal match for that population is 90% — more generous than the traditional Medicaid match which for Florida is roughly 58% (it’s higher for CHIP). That means the federal government pays 58 cents of every Medicaid dollar spent in Florida.
Another way to reduce federal spending is to crack down on so-called “health care provider taxes,” which the state uses as its required match to help fund the program. 
Nursing homes, hospitals, and intermediate care facilities for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities assess these “taxes” upon themselves, rather than run them through the state fiscal system. This allows the state to book lower social services spending while supplying cash for the federally mandated Medicaid match. The mechanism is common among the various states.
The Congressional Budget Office has argued that Congress could save hundreds of billions of dollars by altering or eliminating provider tax options. The discussions generally center around lowering the “safe harbor” that allows states to use hold-harmless arrangements when the provider taxes don’t exceed 6% of net revenue from treating patients.
Hold-harmless arrangements ensure that the taxes collected are  returned to providers in the form of higher Medicaid payments.
Hospitals’ provider taxes run well below that 6% safe harbor, so if Congress adjusts that slightly downward it shouldn’t beggar those providers, Senior said.
His association has been lobbying Congress, trying to ease any hit on Florida’s Medicaid program. So, too, has the Florida Health Care Association, which represents a large swath of Florida’s nursing homes.
“With over two-thirds of our residents relying on Medicaid to cover the cost of their long-term care, reductions to the provider assessment could limit options for our frail elders and their families,” FHCA spokesperson Kristen Knapp said in a written statement.
“We’re working with the American Health Care Association to help Congress understand that Medicaid is a key safety net for our most vulnerable and it must remain strong as our aging population continues to grow,” she said.
The first Trump administration tried to crack down on Medicaid provider taxes. Then–Florida Medicaid Director Beth Kidder wrote a letter opposing the move, saying it would “cripple” the state’s Medicaid program.
Senior, though, is a little more hopeful than Kidder.
“We got to see where it all lands. You could see a package of reductions that would impact Florida or you could see a package that wouldn’t have much of an impact on Florida or Florida hospitals at all,” he said.
Why now?
With some economists predicting a 60% chance of a recession during 2025, Alker also wants to know: Why now?
Medicaid is a counter-cyclical program, meaning enrollment increases during economic downturns. Congress, recognizing that, has generally increased federal matching funds during recessions, Alker noted.
“The fact that Congress would be contemplating one of the biggest cuts in Medicaid that we likely have ever seen at a time when, if the country is going into recession, normally Congress would be increasing Medicaid funding, I think, is a really important point.”

 Don’t forget about the food

Advocates also warned about reductions to SNAP, the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which serves 2.9 million people in Florida. Since the program’s inception, the benefits have always been federally funded, although the state has had to pay half the costs of administering the program.
As part of the budget process, the House agreed to trim $230 billion in agricultural spending. However, there are widespread doubts Congress would cut farm subsidies and will look to cut the SNAP program instead, said Bullard, of the Florida Policy Institute.
“We want to lift up that this additional care program that is also counter-cyclical that is also something that our communities rely on that it is under threat as well.”
Hearn says the federal government is considering requiring the states to help pay for the costs of the benefit.
“And states have never had to do this before, nor are they prepared or have had conversations to do so. And so, just straight math is pretty easy to understand what this would do to the states’ budgets,” Hearn said.
A 10% cost shift to the state would increase costs for Florida by $657 million annually, Hearn said.
Asheena Moses, outreach and advocacy manager for Florida Impact, said there’s a strong connection between good nutrition and good health. Florida Impact is a statewide organization dedicated to advancing health equity by eliminating hunger.
“If SNAP is provided to families and families are able to provide nutritious meals to their children, they are less likely to get sick and be dependent on Medicaid programs, Moses said. 
“SNAP also lifts families out of poverty. It frees up funding for them to get out of debt and it also frees up funding for them to establish themselves in a way that they can be self sufficient — like paying for trade programs or paying for different certifications so that they can get jobs where they make enough money to be lifted out of poverty and difficult situations,” she said.

Yet for over a decade, a little-known law has been quietly increasing your electric bill while stifling innovation in our energy infrastructure.
In 2012, Minnesota passed a “Right of First Refusal” law for electric transmission lines. While the Vikings stadium deal dominated legislative attention, 216B.246 passed unanimously in both chambers. This law gives incumbent utility companies the exclusive right to build new high-voltage transmission lines that connect to their existing infrastructure.
The consequences have been profound and costly for Minnesota ratepayers.
Before this law, Minnesota enjoyed electricity rates significantly lower than the national average — about 18% below in 2001 and still 13% lower in 2011.
Then came the ROFR law in 2012, and this advantage began eroding rapidly. By 2013, rates were only 6.5% below the national average. The downward trend continued until 2020, when rates were virtually identical to the national average — a mere 0.2% lower. While there have been slight improvements recently, Minnesota is nowhere near its former competitive advantage.
This isn’t just about losing an economic edge — it’s a failure to meet the state’s own legal requirements. Minnesota law explicitly mandates that electricity rates should be 5% below the national average. Current rates fail this standard, putting Minnesota in violation of its own energy policy goals.
The ROFR law effectively creates a monopoly, allowing incumbent utilities to build transmission projects without facing competition from potentially more efficient, innovative or cost-effective providers.
Research consistently shows that competitive bidding on transmission projects reduces costs by 20-30%. In the MISO region (which includes Minnesota), competitively bid projects have yielded overall cost savings of 37% for ratepayers. These aren’t small numbers considering the multi-billion-dollar scale of transmission infrastructure. For the average Minnesota family, this could mean significant relief on monthly electric bills.
The stated purpose of the ROFR law is often described as protecting consumers and incumbent utilities from “out-of-state competition.” Instead, it has shielded utilities from any competition, removing incentives to innovate, control costs, or improve efficiency. Under the current law, even if an incumbent utility decides not to build a needed transmission line, alternatives can only be considered after the incumbent formally declines — creating further delays and complications.
The timing for action is critical. Without competitive bidding, massive infrastructure investments will be built at monopoly prices, potentially driving electricity rates even further above the statutory requirement.
Currently, bills SF434 and HF2553 aim to repeal Minnesota’s ROFR law. This repeal represents a crucial opportunity to restore competition, reverse the trend of diminishing rate advantages, and deliver much-needed price relief to Minnesota consumers.
Critics may argue that changing the law will create uncertainty. But courts in other states have already shown the path forward. In Iowa, the Supreme Court characterized their ROFR as “crony capitalism” in 2023. Similarly, Texas courts ruled that ROFRs are “unconstitutional because they violate the dormant Commerce Clause.”
Despite these judicial setbacks, the utility industry continues to push for ROFR laws nationwide. Oklahoma has seen ROFR bills proposed every year for the past four years. Wisconsin is battling to prevent similar legislation. And in Iowa, despite court rulings, new bills have been proposed with the same misleading justifications used when Minnesota’s law was enacted.
The evidence is clear: Monopoly by statute doesn’t work. Competition drives innovation, efficiency, and ultimately, the price relief that Minnesota consumers need.
For a state that values innovation, fair competition, and consumer interests, Minnesota’s ROFR law is an anomaly that must be addressed. Since its enactment, Minnesotans have watched their electricity rate advantage disappear.
It’s time for Minnesota to repeal this costly monopoly protection and restore the competitive advantage it once enjoyed. The state’s energy future — and the relief on your electric bill — depends on it.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tariffphoto2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

(From Holcomb's official Flickr)The Indiana Economic Development Foundation has poured more than $13 million into travel, administrative and other expenses across six years, according to audited financial reports released Thursday under Gov. Mike Braun’s orders.
The little-known foundation is charged with raising private funds to boost the controversial Indiana Economic Development Corp. But the nonprofit is on a spending freeze.
State freezes funding for economic development affiliate, promises audit

Indiana had a traditional commerce department until 2005. That’s when, under former Gov. Mitch Daniels, lawmakers created the IEDC: “a body politic and corporate, not a state agency but an independent instrumentality exercising essential public functions,” per Indiana Code. They allowed its board to create a subsidiary: the foundation.
“Everybody always thinks that the tax dollars are going in one direction: they’re going out to nonprofits to subsidize nonprofit activity,” said Indiana University Professor Beth Gazley, a nonprofit management specialist.
“But actually, there’s a lot of money coming back from nonprofits to subsidize government activities,” she continued, noting that the federal definition of a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit includes “lessening the burdens of government.”
The IEDC’s furtive efforts to secure water, land and more for a contentious technology park have made it plenty of enemies since 2022. But now, its problems go beyond public relations.
Braun said Thursday that he’s ordered a forensic audit and reported “impropriety, or even the appearance of it” to Indiana’s Office of Inspector General amid allegations of self-dealing and more, first reported by Indiana Legislative Insight.
And he’s taken aim at the foundation.
In an April 9 news release, his administration called out the foundation for not filing six years of required audited financial reports with the State Budget Committee. Two weeks later, the lapses were cured and the reports available online.
A spokesperson for the quasi-public agency didn’t immediately answer Capital Chronicle questions, including why those records weren’t submitted.
Reports reveal spending’s focus
The newly released reports show that the foundation spent $13.2 million from the 2019 through 2024 fiscal years, which begin July 1 and end June 30.
The bulk of that, $10.9 million, went to travel, meals and entertainment. Years worth of news releases indicate the foundation has paid for virtually all of the international economic development trips taken by prior governors.
The independent auditor used for the most recent three reports — Indianapolis’ Katz, Sapper & Miller — also included conferences in this category, while the previous one — Missouri’s former BKD — did not.
“Is that a lot of money to be spending on conferences, travel, meals and entertainment? That really depends on the programmatic goals of the organization, the mission of the organization,” Gazley said. “And only the board can decide: is that the best use of our funding?”


The IEDC and its foundation share the same staff and 12-member board.
Gazley also said it’s “best practice” to change auditors over time. Get too “close and clubby” and risk the auditor “not being honest anymore about the financial status of the organization,” she warned.
Another $1.8 million was logged for administrative expenses, plus more than $200,000 for sponsorships.
Nearly $300,000 was categorized as “other” spending. The foundation didn’t immediately answer a question about what kinds of expenditures would fit within this category.
Donor information remains largely under wraps
The reports also disclose about $11.7 million in donations. But they offer no clues as to the identity of those donors. Indiana Code forces the foundation to redact donor names out of public records if they request anonymity at any point in time.
Most do.
The groups behind 14 of 16 transactions from 2020 through 2022 were shielded from records obtained in 2023 by the Capital Chronicle. Two didn’t request anonymity: District of Columbia-based think tank The Urban Institute donated $5,000 in 2021, and the Battery Innovation Center in Newberry gave $12,000 in 2022. Between 2015 and 2025, the center nabbed six incentive contracts that total $18 million, according to the IEDC’s transparency portal.
At the time, spokeswoman Erin Sweitzer wrote that private donations “allow more flexibility in how we use the funds and how quickly we’re able to access them.”
For Gazley, that doesn’t add up.
“I don’t see how you can defend privacy as a programmatic priority, or a mission-related priority. You just can’t,” she said. “But privacy does make a lot of organizations more viable if their donors are concerned about having their (donation) choices on the front page of the newspaper.”
“The kinds of accountability tools that we have for the public with, if I ordered them in priority, transparency would be at the top of the list. And I think it should be at (the) top of everybody’s list,” she added later.
But there are indications of who other foundation givers may be — and evidence several have dealings with the IEDC. Organizations can donate money, sponsor events or provide in-kind services.

A webpage for the foundation identifies the state’s “big five” investor-owned utilities — AES Indiana, CenterPoint Energy, Duke Energy, Indiana Michigan Power and the Northern Indiana Public Service Company — as “contributors.”
AES logged $10 million in professional services contracts that expired in 2023 and about $2.8 million in incentive contracts from 2014, according to the portal, while Duke earned about $150 million in an incentive contract from 2010. Incentives are performance-based, so a recipient may not earn the full amount if its targets aren’t met.
Nine other organizations are dubbed “sponsors” on the webpage. They include Old National Bank, Pure Development, Rolls-Royce, Hoosier Energy, Solv Energy, Doral Renewables, railroad giant Norfolk Southern, workforce development consultant TPMA, and Indiana University’s Ventures startup affiliate.
Pure Development holds a $94.4 million contract for development work. Rolls-Royce received $21,000 after co-sponsoring a Northwest Stadium suite with IEDC for an Army-Navy football match in December and racked up 14 incentive contracts — worth $74.6 million — between 2011 and 2022.
Doral Renewables, meanwhile, is the recipient of two pending incentive contracts totaling $1.5 million. TPMA was recorded as having three service contracts — for almost $190,000 — expiring between 2019 and 2025, and two 2015 incentive contracts worth nearly $400,000.
There’s also more information on the way.
Though the foundation secured an exemption from the Internal Revenue Service in 2012 for future filings of the Form 990, Braun has directed it and other state-affiliated nonprofits to file them annually, regardless of any exemptions. The form describes funding sources and amounts, and how much has been spent on programming versus administrative expenses.
All required reports going back 10 years are due by the end of 2025 under his executive order. They must also be “clearly posted” online “for Hoosiers to read for themselves,” according to a news release.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington State. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.


They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Ed Murray for New Jersey Monitor)Lawmakers like to tout New Jersey as the “state for second chances,” citing its expungement law as a crucial tool for helping people move on from their mistakes.
But should cops who commit serious crimes that they later get expunged get to hide their wrongdoing from the public they police?
That was the question before the New Jersey Supreme Court Tuesday, when justices heard arguments in the case of a Jersey City police lieutenant who got his felony charges expunged after authorities say he downed six to eight beers and then shot at his guests during a dispute at a party at his Sussex County home.
States Newsroom, the parent company of New Jersey Monitor, sued Jersey City in 2022 after officials there refused to release the police department’s internal affairs report on the August 2019 incident that led state troopers to charge Lt. Michael Timmins with terroristic threats and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes. County prosecutors allowed Timmins to complete a pretrial diversionary program that cleared the way for expungement, even though his offenses violated the Graves Act, a state law that requires mandatory prison sentences for some gun crimes.
City officials defended their refusal to disclose Timmins’ disciplinary file as necessary under the state’s expungement statute, which threatens violators who knowingly disclose expunged records with a $200 fine and disorderly conduct charge.
Internal affairs reports are not public records under New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act. But a state Supreme Court ruling from March 2022 requires police to release internal affairs reports under the common law right of access when the public’s interest in them outweighs an officer’s confidentiality concerns, noted attorney CJ Griffin, who represents the New Jersey Monitor.
The city’s denial also came before a judge approved Timmins’ expungement request, compounding officials’ error in their failure to disclose, Griffin added. That wrongly impeded the New Jersey Monitor from alerting the public about a problematic officer whose “sweetheart deal” to dodge discipline raises questions about police accountability in Jersey City, the state’s second-largest city, she said.
“The IA unit concluded that it was merely negligent behavior, and this officer received only a 90-day suspension and is still on this force despite his dangerous behavior that could have resulted in killing someone,” Griffin told justices Tuesday.
The city’s response to Timmins’ misconduct is even more of a matter of public concern because Jersey City’s longtime mayor, Steven Fulop, is now running for New Jersey governor, she added.
“Transparency is very important to the public, trusting the police. And the public often feels that police are given special treatment, that they cover up for each other, that the internal affairs unit doesn’t hold their fellow officers accountable. And I’ve personally seen that every time we come to this court and obtain a landmark decision that gives us transparency, then we see agencies finding a way to evade that transparency. So those things are all present in this case,” Griffin said.
Attorneys from the state attorney general’s and public defenders’ offices joined Griffin in arguing that such disclosure is warranted, though for slightly different reasons.
Viviana M. Hanley, representing the Attorney General’s Office, said such internal affairs records should be made public to protect the public’s trust in police accountability — as long as they’re redacted to hide things a judge has ordered expunged, such as the cop’s arrest, detention, trial, and offense.
Michael Noveck, from the Office of the Public Defender, echoed that sentiment but rejected the idea of redactions. Officers’ misconduct — including expunged crimes — serve as exculpatory and impeachment evidence that authorities are obligated to share with the juries that are tasked with weighing the credibility of cops who testify against criminal defendants, Noveck said. Details of Timmins’ arrest were revealed in just such a case.
Attorney Jeremy Jacobsen, representing Jersey City, countered that the state’s expungement statute contains no exceptions that allow expunged records to be disclosed to media outlets.
“We need to make sure that we are adhering to the plain language of the statute, because there’s a lot at risk here if we get it wrong,” Jacobsen said. “We’re exposing our employees to criminal penalties here.”
The New Jersey Monitor’s fight is a policy one that should be fought in the Statehouse, he added.
“If they’re looking for public policy changes, they’re in the wrong building. They should be lobbying the Legislature,” he said.
Democrat running for governor wants more transparency in Trenton — what about in his own backyard?

The Municipal Clerks’ Association of New Jersey backed Jacobsen, with attorney Michael S. Carucci telling the justices that clerks labor under “this heavy cloud” of risking a disorderly persons offense for wrongly releasing expunged records. Disclosure laws require public officials to reveal reasons for redactions, so clerks weighing whether to release information on expunged cases risk litigation either from requestors who get no answer when they challenge redactions or from officers who feel their expungements were wrongly revealed, he added.
“The cat would be out of the bag. The requester would know that something’s up here, that there is expunged information,” Carucci said.
Such concerns did give some justices pause.
“Under what authority can this court overrule the Legislature when it passes a law that says ‘X’ will not be disclosed?” Justice Rachel Wainer Apter asked Griffin.
Griffin underscored that New Jersey Monitor’s request for Timmins’ internal affairs report predated the expungement.
“The facts were all public when we filed the request and when we filed the lawsuit,” she said.
In further questioning over nearly three hours of arguments, some justices seemed to side with disclosure, possibly with redactions to protect information excluded under the expungement statute.
Internal affairs investigators weigh administrative violations, more so than crimes, and the expungement statute applies to criminal justice matters rather than workplace discipline, Wainer Apter noted.
“I’m just having trouble understanding why if a criminal proceeding — if the person happens to be charged with a crime, the entire existence of the IA investigation all of a sudden becomes expunged,” she said.
It’s unclear when the court will return a ruling.

(Getty Images)With the 2025 budget session now in the rear-view mirror, Hoosier veterans are taking note not only of what passed and what didn’t, but how it all unfolded.
This session brought minimal progress for Indiana’s veterans. Some long overdue improvements made it through, but far too many priorities were ignored, watered down, or outright rejected.
What we gained
One win was expanded life insurance for Indiana National Guard members. Lawmakers approved a long-overdue increase in coverage — from $8,000 to $20,000 — for those who die while serving on state active duty orders.
The General Assembly also modernized charitable gaming. Veteran service organizations can now use electronic pull-tabs and apply revenues more flexibly. This modernization was decades in the making.
Businesses assisting veterans with their benefits must now be accredited and required to inform veterans of the free services available to them.
The Indiana Code now recognizes the U.S. Space Force, U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps — making their income exempt from state tax.
These are meaningful steps, but they pale in comparison to the support veterans deserve and the issues left unaddressed.
What we lost or never gained
Despite its potential to save lives, especially for veterans with traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress, the proposed hyperbaric oxygen therapy program failed to advance.
And there is still no restoration of tuition remission for children of disabled veterans, a benefit stripped away in 2011 and not returned.
Once again, Indiana’s reserve forces were left behind, with no state-funded education support.
We stopped a House attempt to raid the Veterans Affairs Trust Fund of $1.25 Million annually for a state program only to see the Senate reinsert the same provision. The Military Family Relief Fund, funded by Hoosiers to support veterans in need, is being quietly siphoned off to fund state agency advertising. Up to 10% of the fund is taken each year, despite the agency already having a communications staff and outside marketing firm on payroll.
That same agency also blocked a bill that would have allowed disabled veterans to access hyperbaric oxygen therapy through the fund. Veterans were denied critical care and a bureaucracy won out. That’s not supporting veterans, that’s exploiting them.
Property taxes
In 1975, Indiana honored disabled veterans with a property tax deduction of $24,950—when the average home cost just $39,000. An additional $14,000 was granted for the totally disabled. Many paid little to no property taxes as a result. It was a tangible, targeted acknowledgment of their sacrifice.

Fast forward to 2025: In an attempt to address broader property tax issues, the General Assembly proposed folding veterans into a general tax credit system.
Under the original plan: all homeowners would get a $300 credit and disabled veterans would receive an additional $250.
Those over 62 or totally disabled would get another $150. However, those over 62 and totally disabled would be excluded from the senior credit entirely.
This was not a continuation of the original benefit, it was a replacement that undermined it. Veterans spoke out. The Indiana American Legion issued a call to action. The Military Veterans Coalition of Indiana mobilized. On the final day of session, lawmakers reversed course and reinstated the original property tax deduction for disabled veterans.
While that correction matters, it shouldn’t be viewed as a win. It was a fix for a mistake that should never have been made and it still leaves the deduction unchanged from 50 years ago. No adjustment for inflation. No reflection of today’s housing market. Just the bare minimum to maintain appearances.
Veteran benefits
Also in the final hours of session, lawmakers inserted language into a conference report that fundamentally alters who is eligible for benefits in Indiana throughout the Indiana code. Anywhere the law previously required an “Honorable Discharge,” it now reads “Anything Other Than Dishonorable.”
This opens the door to eligibility for those with bad conduct and other-than-honorable discharges. To manage this, the Indiana Veterans Commission is tasked with reviewing DD-214 discharge codes which the Department of Defense stopped publicly sharing in 2022. This is a bureaucratic workaround to a problem that shouldn’t exist. The longstanding definition of a veteran, one who earned benefits through honorable service is being rewritten without adequate oversight or public input. Benefits come with honorable service. Period. Rewriting that standard isn’t equity, it’s erasure.
This session proved that vigilance is necessary. When legislators tried to undermine or redirect hard-earned benefits, veterans stood up, spoke out, and pushed back. And we’re not done.
Hoosier veterans live to fight another day. And fight we will.

(Screenshot of Court of Appeals livestream)Do streaming services count as video service providers and should they be subject to franchise fees like traditional cable TV? Judges Melissa May, Elizabeth Tavitas and Paul Felix weighed the above question in a remote hearing held at Wabash College on Tuesday.
Also at question was whether lawmakers unconstitutionally intervened in 2023 to nullify a lawsuit filed by four Indiana cities seeking to recoup franchise fees from some streaming service providers.  
In August 2020, four cities sued a handful of streaming services seeking franchise fees equal to 5% of local gross revenue for using facilities in the public right-of-way, similar to how cable television stations operate. 
A 2006 law requires video service providers to be licensed with the state and pay quarterly franchise fees to cities and other governments. But the cities of Fishers, Indianapolis, Evansville and Valparaiso say that streaming giants like Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, DirectTV and Dish Network haven’t complied. 
Such companies depend on Internet services, specifically shared cables that are part of the greater utility framework accessed through public right-of-way. 
  Michael Limrick, a partner with Hoover Hull Turner LLP, argues on behalf of four cities before the Indiana Court of Appeals on April 29, 2025. (Screenshot of Court of Appeals livestream)
“I’m accessing the Hulu programming via the Internet, but I can only access that because the programming has traveled through the public right-of-way to get to my house,” argued attorney Michael Limrick on behalf of the cities. “… if I’m going to pull up programming on my phone that will have been broadcast to my phone from a tower that may be sitting in the public right-of-way.”
Broadcasting through satellite services, for example, wouldn’t be included under Indiana’s video service provider law, Limrick said. 
But, rather than letting such questions play out in the courts, the General Assembly intervened, tweaking the definition of video service providers in a way that killed the effort.
The original version of the bill that became House Enrolled Act 1454 didn’t include any mention of video service providers, but as the 2023 bill grew from 42 pages to 282 pages, it picked up provisions. The relevant addition explicitly said that video programming offered over the Internet isn’t considered to be a video service provider — and then backdated the language to 2006, when the franchise fees were established. 
On Tuesday, judges also wondered whether re-opening up the definition in a way that includes the Internet might capture other forms of video content, such as creators on YouTube and TikTok. 
“We have these YouTube producers that are making all of these videos … somebody like a Mr. Beast, who now has huge production abilities. He’s not just a guy with a cell phone anymore taking videos of the crazy things he’s doing,” said Felix. “It begins to blur the line as to what is video programming that’s similar to regular broadcast.” 
Limrick argued that accessing YouTube videos aren’t all fee based, though he acknowledged there’s a separate, paid service for watching live television and ad-free videos built into the platform. 
 The case for streaming services

Citing the new law, a trial court judge ruled in favor of the streaming services to dismiss the case and ruled that the additions were constitutional in June 2024. A story from the Northwest Indiana Times detailing the bill’s journey to become law reported that the author said the language came from a lobbyist affiliated with Dish Network. 
But the cities continued to argue that lawmakers overstepped by adding the video service provider language to a bill that initially sought to address certain Department of Local Government Finance concerns — in effect, creating “special” legislation.
 


				Attorney General Todd Rokita, arguing on behalf of the General Assembly, affirmed the trial court’s ruling on the constitutionality of the legislature’s actions in a December filing. However, should judges rule otherwise, he urged the appeals court to sever the specific portion of House Enrolled Act 1454 concerning video streaming providers from the rest of the law. 
“… but this remedy is unnecessary in this case because (House Enrolled Act) 1454 is constitutional,” he continued. “Therefore, this Court should affirm the order of dismissal.” 			



Peter E. Davis, arguing on behalf of Netflix and others, said it didn’t count as special legislation and simply clarified existing law — noting that it mirrors how other states have approached the issue. 
“The cities’ arguments today undermine the General Assembly’s ability to legislate, both for this case and for the future,” said Davis. “… The cities’ argument would make such amendments impossible, locking Indiana into taxes and fees passed in a different time, in a different day, with no ability to adjust.” 
  Peter E. Davis, an attorney with Latham & Watkins LLP, argues on behalf of streaming services before the Indiana Court of Appeals on April 29, 2025. (Screenshot from Indiana Court of Appeals livestream)
Davis said it was his understanding that Internet service providers don’t pay franchise fees either. Additionally, since the companies are “agnostic” about how users access their offerings — whether by phone, Internet or otherwise — he said it makes “very little sense to impose a fee” on streaming.
“What the Internet service provider is doing is very different than what a cable company is doing … they’re enabling access to all kinds of content. So it’s not just video, but it’s email. It’s information; it’s social media; it’s video games,” said Davis. “It doesn’t make any sense to impose franchise fees on just one piece of something that the Internet service provider — whose not even the streaming company here — is ultimately providing.”
He also pointed to a 2022 report from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission concluding that “streaming video is not treated as a traditional video provider and, therefore, is not required to obtain a state-issued franchise.”
However, in a rebuttal, Limrick argued against the notion that the legislature only wanted to regulate the companies installing wiring for the Internet in the public right-of-way. 
“It could do that; it hasn’t done that,” said Limrick. “What the act regulates are companies that transmit video programming through facilities located, at least in part, in the public right-of-way.
“… the act says nothing about who owns those facilities,” continued Limrick, referring to the 2006 law. 
Carving out streaming services who operate using the Internet, he said, would be special treatment. 
Felix noted a “tension” created by the arguments because any ruling would impact not only existing streaming services but companies yet to be created. The three judges didn’t indicate when to anticipate their ruling.

Program participants enroll in AmeriCorps and are paid an hourly wage for their work. (Photo courtesy of Western Dairyland EOC Inc.) A coalition of 25 states, including Wisconsin, sued the Trump administration Tuesday to block the cancellation of AmeriCorps programs across the country.
The cancellation has upended plans at more than two dozen organizations in Wisconsin that have engaged AmeriCorps members in community service work, and stranded scores of participants in the midst of one-year stints in the program.
“I was completely blindsided,” Parker Kuehni told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday. The University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate with a degree in global health was in his second year with AmeriCorps, working at a Madison free health clinic and preparing to start medical school in June when he learned Monday morning that the program was canceled.
Created by Congress in 1993 as the Corporation for National and Community Service, its official name, AmeriCorps has deployed community service workers across the country in the decades since. AmeriCorps members are usually recent college graduates who join the program for a year or two. They teach in schools, assist with disaster relief and take on a host of other roles. 
Wisconsin has 25 AmeriCorps programs that operate at more than 300 locations across the state, according to the office of Gov. Tony Evers. In Wisconsin, AmeriCorps operates through Serve Wisconsin, which administers its Wisconsin contracts and is housed in the Department of Administration.
On April 16, AmeriCorps placed about 75% of its employees on administrative leave with pay, the New York Times reported.
At 6:20 p.m. on Friday, April 25, Jeanne Duffy, the Serve Wisconsin executive director, received an email message that AmeriCorps grants and their recipients in Wisconsin were being terminated immediately “because it has been determined that the award no longer effectuates agency priorities.”
The form letter instructed recipients to notify all organizations and agencies with AmeriCorps-related projects. “You must immediately cease all award activities. This is a final agency action and is not administratively appealable,” the message said.
Lawsuit: Cancellation ‘usurps Congress’s power of the purse’
The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Maryland charges the Trump administration’s cancellation of the program “flouts Congress’s creation of AmeriCorps and assignment of agency duties; usurps Congress’s power of the purse and thereby violates the Constitution’s separation of powers; and arbitrarily and capriciously — without any reasoned analysis — vitiates the agency’s ability to function consistent with its statutory mission and purpose.”
The suit charges that the program’s abrupt end also violates federal law, which states AmeriCorps can make “significant changes to program requirements, service delivery or policy only through public notice and comment rulemaking.”
“The attempt to dismantle AmeriCorps is part of a pattern from the Trump administration of disrespect toward those who serve others,” Attorney General Josh Kaul said in a statement. “That approach is not just shameful — it’s misguided. AmeriCorps volunteers and projects help strengthen communities. AmeriCorps should be thanked for its work, not abruptly dismantled.”
Evers’ office telegraphed Wisconsin’s plan to join the lawsuit late Tuesday morning.
“Once again, the Trump Administration is trying to cut federal funding that Congress already approved and Wisconsin is counting on to help kids, families, and communities across our state — all so they can pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires,” Evers said in a statement. “These latest reckless Trump and Musk cuts will hurt Wisconsin’s kids who are homeless or who need tutors for math and reading, folks who are working to overcome addiction and substance use, stop work on conservation projects, as well as all of the dedicated public servants whose livelihoods are depending on this work.”
Tutoring programs, health care clinics
AmeriCorps’ cancellation affected organizations and agencies all across the state.
In Madison, the United Way of Dane County enlisted 27 AmeriCorps members in two tutoring programs — one in math for high school students and the other in reading and literacy for elementary school children.
AmeriCorps members were placed in schools to help identify students who would benefit from tutoring, United Way officials said. They also screened and conducted background checks for more than 175 community volunteer tutors as well as serving as tutors themselves. More than 1,000 children have received tutoring in the two programs this year.
“And these kids are able to accelerate their academic success, which puts them on track for [higher] graduation rates,” said United Way CEO Renee Moe. “So, this is a really huge loss for us.”
AmeriCorps members were “really key to having successful volunteers support students in literacy,” said Emily Greene, director of Schools of Hope, the elementary program.
In the high school program, Achievement Connections, members have supported and trained other high school students as peer tutors. That helps those students “be engaged in their school in a way that they otherwise wouldn’t be and also gain some skills,” said Karl Johnson, director of Achievement Connections.
“We find that those relationships . . . are some of our strongest when it’s students helping each other out, and our [AmeriCorps] members are a pretty key part of facilitating that,” Johnson said.
The Wisconsin Association of Free and Charitable Clinics has deployed 30 AmeriCorps members throughout Wisconsin this year.
Some assist clinics, local health departments or the state Department of Health Services in administrative tasks, writing grants, collecting and analyzing data and related work, said Domonique Coffee, the association’s AmeriCorps program manager. Others staff clinics in a public health role, taking a patient’s blood pressure or other vital signs, teaching patients about managing their diabetes or hypertension or providing other direct care, she said.
The program allowed “free and charitable clinics to increase their services and capacity for services . . . to those who are underinsured or uninsured,” Coffee said.
It has also helped prepare the AmeriCorps members as future health care providers — “the future physicians and public health leaders of our next generation,” she added.
Fostering skills for careers and life
Parker Kuehni had graduated with a degree in global public health two years ago and was preparing to go to medical school. But he knew he first wanted to get more experience in directly working with patients.
He volunteered as a barbershop health screener for the Perry Family Free Clinic, which serves uninsured, low-income Madison residents. Through the clinic he connected with AmeriCorps and then shifted to helping with patient coordination, communication and scheduling, discussing care plans with patients and managing referrals to specialists.
The experience “built my empathy for people,” he said. The experiences he had “will contribute to me being an overall better future physician.”
While the typical AmeriCorps participant is a college graduate, the Western Dairyland Economic Opportunity Council in Eau Claire took a different approach with the program.
Since the late 1990s Western Dairyland has operated Fresh Start, an education, skills and career program for young adults ages 18 to 25. Participants often have a sparse job history and might not have completed high school.
The program engages up to 15 participants in a year-long house-building project. “We provide them with life skills and job skills and technical education, allowing them to then leave the program and either go on to school or attain full-time employment,” said Dale Karls, Western Dairyland’s communications coordinator.
The participants themselves become AmeriCorps members and earn an hourly wage on the job. Some 600 young people have gone through the program over the last three decades, building 45 homes, Karls said.
All the organizations the Wisconsin Examiner contacted Tuesday said the news of AmeriCorps’ cancellation came too recently  for them to know what they will do if the program isn’t restored.
Coffee said the Wisconsin Free and Charitable Clinics Association is trying to support its AmeriCorps members, “helping them find their footing.”
At United Way of Dane County, “We’ve spoken to our school district partners,” said Moe, the agency’s CEO. “We have reaffirmed with them that tutoring continues to be an important strategy to help with academic success. And so right now we’re trying to be creative around how to best keep really effective tutoring programs going.”
“We’re hoping that the funding will be reinstated,” said Karls of Western Dairyland. In the meantime, he added, “We have a half-constructed house in Strum, Wisconsin. We have to find a way to finish that.”

(Courtesy of the Utah Senate)Utah state leaders are taking the next steps in their efforts to make Utah a major nuclear energy development hub and a “national leader” in developing next-generation energy technology, reaching beyond state lines to do it.
It starts with Utah signing two memorandums of understanding with Idaho and Wyoming as part of a strategy to fire up innovation and collaboration in the region.
Idaho, feds agree to waiver of 1995 settlement agreement on nuclear fuel storage

As part of Gov. Spencer Cox’s “Built Here: Nuclear Energy Summit,” which his office said brought together leaders from across the nuclear energy industry on Tuesday, Cox joined Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon in signing an MOU that calls for the three states to work together coordinating nuclear infrastructure, accelerating nuclear development, and advocating for “commonsense federal policies.”
“The West will lead the next chapter of energy abundance and American prosperity,” Cox said in a statement announcing the alliance. “Today, we brought together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to chart the course for nuclear energy. Our new compact strengthens our shared commitment to aggressively pursue more affordable, reliable energy across state lines.”
According to Cox’s office, the states agreed in the MOU to collaborate on:

Aligning energy policies to support innovation and private investment.
Coordinating the development of critical energy infrastructure.
Jointly navigating regulatory and environmental challenges.
Advocating for federal support of regional energy priorities.
Enhancing energy resilience and grid reliability.
Expanding workforce development efforts to support the growing energy sector.
Ensuring continued delivery of affordable energy to residents.

 Utah, Idaho National Laboratory establish ‘formal, long-term collaboration’

The tri-state agreement comes the day after Utah officials and the Idaho National Laboratory — one of 17 national labs in the U.S. Department of Energy complex that’s focused on nuclear research — signed a memorandum of understanding Monday evening after ceremoniously signing a slate of energy bills Utah lawmakers passed earlier this year.
The MOU between Utah leaders and the Idaho National Laboratory establishes a “formal, long-term collaboration on advanced energy research, workforce development and technology deployment — particularly on nuclear innovation,” according to the governor’s office.

“This partnership will accelerate Utah’s efforts to become the nation’s nuclear hub,” Gov. Cox said in a prepared statement issued Monday evening. “By linking our universities, labs, and industry partners with the expertise of Idaho National Laboratory, we are strengthening our ability to serve Utahns with reliable and affordable energy.”
Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner, who signed the MOU, said he and other lab officials are “excited to partner with Utah to address urgent energy needs by focusing on advanced nuclear and energy innovation.”
“This partnership establishes a cooperative framework for scientific, technological and workforce development to help Utah realize an abundant, secure, resilient and competitive energy future,” he said.
The MOU, according to the Utah governor’s office, creates a “structural, interdisciplinary alliance” between Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory. It envisions Utah as establishing a new institute called the Advanced Nuclear Energy Institute as a “key coordinating hub” between the Idaho National Laboratory, Utah’s system of higher education, the Utah Office of Energy Development, and the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab.
“By linking the capabilities of INL with the talent and resources of Utah’s higher education institutions, this partnership positions Utah as a national leader in developing the next generation of clean, secure and resilient energy technologies,” the governor’s office said in Monday’s news release.
This new institute, state officials say, will enable Utah’s universities to collaborate with other organizations to pursue federal research grants.
“Beyond academic research, the focus is on applied innovation — ensuring resources are used effectively to develop commercially viable, scalable technologies,” the governor’s office said. “This approach will accelerate the deployment of real-world energy solutions and help build a broader, more robust nuclear energy ecosystem in Utah and the surrounding region.”
 How will the state of Utah and the INL work together?

Through the MOU, state leaders say Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory will work together to:

Accelerate development of “next-generation” nuclear technologies.
Enhance scientific research in energy sectors.
Strengthen cybersecurity and physical security for energy infrastructure.
Build up the workforce needed to meet demands of a future energy economy.

The Utah Legislature’s top Republican leaders applauded the move as crucial for Utah’s future.
“Affordable, reliable energy is the driving force behind Utah’s prosperity — powering everything from the lights in Utahns homes to the unstoppable growth of the state’s vibrant economy,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a prepared statement. “As energy demands increase and technologies rapidly evolve, we as a state are committed to staying ahead of the curve through strategic partnership that ensures both innovation and stability.”
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said Utah “is leading the way with smart, strategic investments in our energy future.”
“This partnership drives innovation and keeps energy reliable and affordable for Utah families and businesses,” Schultz said. “It’s about long-term solutions that protect our economy and strengthen our position as a national energy leader.”

But ultimately Allen’s story ended in tragedy, after Marko said Child Protective Services, or CPS, failed to act on multiple occasions.
“The warning bells had been going off for years, and nothing was done,” Marko told lawmakers, saying that when Allen was 2 months old, CPS was aware he had been beaten, sustaining a black eye and abrasions to his genitalia, and was living in a home with no beds.
“It was rat infested. The rats had actually eaten through the pack and play that him and his siblings had been left in and [the rats had] eaten holes in the pack and play,” Marko said.
In this instance, Allen and his siblings were removed from the home, but were later placed back with their mother, Marko said, adding that two months later Allen was found with burns on his hands when CPS came to the home again.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Marko is one of the attorneys working on a lawsuit filed a month ago against employees of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, Children’s Protective Services Division. It outlines the multiple interactions Allen had with CPS, with evidence reflecting that Allen was rendered blind and suffered from frequent vomiting due to frequent physical abuse.
“Defendants were entrusted with the duty of protecting this vulnerable child from harm and neglect and had the chance to intervene and diligently respond to the severity of the situation and the horrific nature of the allegations,” the lawsuit reads. “However, each time, Defendants left Chayce with or returned him soon after to his abusive mother.”
Residents of Michigan began to learn of the horrors Allen faced when law enforcement and other authorities discovered Allen’s body in a freezer during a wellness check in June of 2022. Law enforcement determined Allen had been dead for months and his mother, Azuradee France, 33, was sent to prison for second-degree murder.
The system needs to be fixed, Marko told lawmakers Tuesday.
“It’s hurting the people of the state of Michigan and for many there’s no justice… and the problem is that a lot of times, the state or the individuals who we entrust to protect these children don’t act and a lot of time they don’t do anything until it’s too late,” Marko said.
The state House Child Welfare System Committee has been looking into the state health department, where Child Protective Services is housed, for weeks, evaluating current policies within the department and hearing testimony from stakeholders. For the past two weeks, Members of the Office of the Auditor General have outlined areas of concern the office found in an audit in 2018 that it says persisted in a follow up evaluation in 2024, including what the office asserts are delays in CPS opening investigations that could lead to children being left in dangerous situations.
Even with Allen’s mother serving her sentence for her crimes, justice has not been served while the systems that were of the abuse and allowed it to continue go unchecked, chair of the committee Rep. Luke Meerman (R-Coopersville) said.
“Life is sacred and any life lost is a tragedy. When life is lost after CPS has become involved in a child’s care, it’s a blight on the state and the system responsible for that child’s care,” Meerman said.
It’s heartbreaking to see vulnerable adults and children continue to suffer after CPS or Adult Protective Services doesn’t intervene, Monroe County Sheriff Troy Goodnough told lawmakers.

Goodnough recalled details of the conditions two children in his jurisdiction have been living in since 2023, in which the family was found living in a tent during the winter both in 2023 and 2024, while the kids were covered in lice and hadn’t been to school in more than a year.
“I had two grown command officers come into my office saying we’ve got to do something, we’ve got to do something. They’ve not eaten. They’ve not bathed,” Goodnough said.
Despite multiple attempts to connect the family to CPS, Goodnough said his department has not heard from CPS on the case and has relied on a local church’s services to offer help to the family. It’s not sustainable for welfare services to ignore need in the state, Goodnough said, and something needs to change.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-29-at-4.34.08 PM-1024x579.png,,,2025-04-30 07:02:23.692946

Western tribal groups and environmentalists defend the recent ban on new Powder River Basin coal mining leases, but Trump and Wyoming covet a coal comeback.

On a cool morning in late February, Mark Fix was up before the sun to watch the Tongue River on his ranch in southeast Montana. He was concerned that a breaching ice dam could put his cattle and property in the path of rushing water carrying plates of ice the size of a dinner table.  
He was relieved to find that only his fencing and the riverbanks were damaged; his cattle were spooked but okay, he said. Across three decades of ranching on his property about 20 miles south of Miles City, Montana, Fix, who was born in Ekalaka, has grown accustomed to contending with threats from Mother Nature, but has also noticed them intensifying and accelerating.
“As I get older, it is harder to go through all of these unique climate change deals that we get hit with,” he said. About 10 years ago, a tornado ripped through Fix’s ranch, slashing through the roofs of his barn and home. He remembers winds reaching 100 miles per hour.
“I thought, ‘What the heck? We don’t have this kind of stuff in Montana.’”
In February, Northern Plains Resource Council, the Montana-based environmental organization Fix used to chair, joined other environmental groups and two tribes in a request filed with the U.S. District Court for Wyoming to allow them to join proceedings in a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management over two resource management plans the agency issued last year. The lawsuit, however, wasn’t intended to fight the BLM’s plans, but to make sure the agency defends them.
The plans, one in its Buffalo, Wyoming office, the other in its Miles City, Montana office, directed the BLM to stop issuing new coal mining leases in the Powder River Basin, a mineral-rich formation straddling southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming.

The Northern Plains Resource Council was concerned that, with President Donald Trump back in the White House, the agency would not defend its resource management plans in court. It was joined by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, whose reservation lies atop the formation in southeast Montana, a group of environmental activists from the Navajo Nation, which holds mineral rights in the basin, and other environmental groups who shared that concern.
Then, in April, Trump signed an executive order aimed at rejuvenating U.S. coal, which has been hemorrhaging jobs and revenue for decades as mining has become more efficient, and utilities have switched to cheaper ways of generating electricity, like natural gas and, increasingly, even-cheaper wind and solar. Trump directed the Secretary of the Interior to prioritize coal leasing as “the primary land use for the public lands with coal resources,” required federal agencies to consider “revising or rescinding” federal actions that would transition the nation away from coal and signed a proclamation loosening air pollution restrictions for coal-fired power plants.
Coal mining appeared poised to make a comeback in the Powder River Basin.
A BLM spokesperson said in an email that the agency “is currently in the process of reviewing these resource management plans, as directed by relevant Executive and Secretarial orders,” and added in a separate email that “the BLM is committed to supporting the Trump administration’s prioritization of responsible energy development to make life more affordable for every American family while showing the world the power of America’s natural resources and innovation.”
Yet, burning coal is one of the most expensive ways of generating electricity, behind only nuclear energy and gas-fired “peaker plants,” according to one estimate.
“We’ll continue to try and defend these plans until, essentially, they no longer exist.”Melissa Hornbein, Western Environmental Law Center
The Trump administration is “seeking to undo [the two resource management plans] and they want to promulgate a new decision consistent” with Trump’s energy policy, said Melissa Hornbein, an attorney for the Western Environmental Law Center, which is representing several of the parties seeking to intervene in the Montana and Wyoming suit. Since Trump was sworn in in January, Hornbein said the federal government has been filing motions to stay cases that would require the Trump administration to defend policies enacted when Biden was president, which could happen in the effort to preserve the BLM’s Buffalo and Miles City resource management plans. 
“We’ll continue to try and defend these plans until, essentially, they no longer exist,” she said.
Wyoming is confident those plans will be replaced. In early March, state house lawmaker Scott Heiner, representing parts of Lincoln, Sweetwater and Uinta counties in southwest Wyoming, told Cowboy State Daily that Wyoming was beginning to study building a new “coal-fired plant” using $10 million in state-taxpayer dollars to help fund a yet-to-be-announced project.

“With the new administration, I think they will overturn that [resource management plan] in Buffalo,” the BLM field office that halted new coal leases in northeast Wyoming, “and I think there will be more opportunities to mine coal here in Wyoming,” he told Inside Climate News. Under Trump, Heiner sees “a chance to revitalize coal mining.”
The Powder River Basin, where mining companies report billions in annual revenue and hundreds of millions in profit, produces 41% of U.S. coal, according to Energy Information Administration data from 2022. For decades, while coal from the Powder River Basin was shipped across the U.S. as fuel for electricity plants, communities in Northeastern Wyoming benefited from the industry’s tax revenue. 
But, the tensions between coal’s local benefits and its costliness, dirtiness and production of greenhouse gases warming the climate means it faces an uncertain future, even under the auspices of a friendly Trump administration, leading some communities in the region to begin trying to diversify their economy beyond the thermal coal industry.
Still, for many on the ground, that future still includes mining coal.
Defending ‘good decisions’
Environmentalists and native groups who want to see the latest BLM resource management plans remain in place say that the environmental harms that come from mining and burning coal disqualify its continued extraction. 
“For over 100 years we’ve been affected by different types of resource extraction on our land,” said Robyn Jackson, executive director with Diné C.A.R.E, an environmental nonprofit located in the southwest’s four-corners region within the Navajo Nation. Jackson, who is Diné, the tribal name for Navajo people, said any benefits from mineral extraction — typically from the Navajo leasing land to companies — pale in comparison to “the cumulative impact of that to our air, our water, our land and the public health.”
Even though Jackson does not live near the Powder River Basin, she is worried about the Navajo footprint there. Navajo Transitional Energy Company, an energy company whose sole shareholder is the Navajo Nation, has three coal mines in the Powder River Basin, whose coal spreads below the Crow and Northern Cheyenne reservations in Montana. 
“​​We’re disappointed in the direction [NTEC is] taking of more fossil fuel development, of not limiting their carbon emissions — and especially with coal that does not seem to be a long-term source of revenue for our tribe” as demand for it continues to fall worldwide, Jackson said. “They need to be addressing the climate crisis, not emitting more carbon emissions, not emitting more greenhouse gases. And, really, they should be finding other sources of revenue that are going to be sustainable in the long term.”
The notion that one tribe could be detrimentally affecting another is part of the reason Diné C.A.R.E. has moved to defend the BLM’s decision to stop issuing future coal leases. NTEC’s operations in the basin are “exploitative towards other tribes and impacts their ancestral traditional lands, traditional cultural properties,” Jackson said.
The Northern Cheyenne, the Crow tribe and NTEC did not return interview requests.

Facing headwinds, Wyoming coal industry ‘cautiously optimistic’ about Trump administration 



Fix, the Montana rancher, is concerned that more coal mining will continue to worsen the effects of climate change, and he called the BLM’s decision to stop issuing new leases in the region “common sense” in a press release announcing the motion to intervene.
“This coal will probably never be developed because we’re going to renewables,” he said. “We got better ways to do things now than coal.”
While renewable energy has grown significantly in market share, natural gas has been the primary culprit for coal’s declining demand over the last decade.
If the Trump administration moves to stay the case or begins issuing new resource management plans in Miles City and Buffalo, a time-consuming endeavor, the environmental and tribal groups plan to continue fighting new coal mine leases.
“There were some good decisions that happened in the prior administration and we can’t let that go,” Jackson said.
A Mining Rebirth?
There are some in the region who hope to see coal mining continue, even if it’s never used to generate electricity. The current BLM management plans are “not good plans for us,” said Rusty Bell, director of Gillette’s office of economic transformation, who is working on diversifying the region’s economy. Bell said that Campbell County had received a grant from the Economic Development Administration under President Biden to build the Wyoming Innovation Center in Gillette, which researches ways to use coal for commercially viable products, like bricks, instead of using it as fuel to generate electricity. Ending mining in the Powder River Basin contradicts that effort, Bell said.
“Why would they, you know, allow us to do research on our resource, and then tell us we can’t use our resource?” asked Bell. “It doesn’t make sense.”
Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association, agreed with Bell. “We have to have access to our coal resource, and we have to have access to our resource far into the future,” he said.
Fix doesn’t want Powder River Basin coal mined for uses besides combustion. “A lot of our aquifers are in that coal,” he said. Mining removes water from the subsurface, limiting ranchers’ ability to water their cattle nearby. “It doesn’t matter what you develop it for, you still end up taking the water away.”
Deti estimated that current mining operations in the basin will cover the demand for its coal for the next 15 years, but almost all of that supply is already spoken for. New mining would pave the way for another coal plant to come online in Wyoming.
“It’s a pretty exciting time for the coal industry,” he said.
“Trump came in and gave carte blanche authority to the big coal corporations and said ‘the heck with all the little guys—all the guys working the land trying to make a living.’”Mark Fix, Montana rancher
Such a facility would be the first new coal-fired plant built in the U.S. in over a decade, and would be the first in Wyoming to include carbon capture, potentially increasing the cost to consumers, but providing a new, marketable resource — carbon dioxide.
“CO2 is valuable, and it can be used,” Deti said. He pointed to “enhanced oil recovery,” whereby a company injects CO2 underground to stimulate an oilfield’s production, as such an example.
Deti said he does not necessarily believe carbon dioxide is contributing to climate change, but if limiting CO2 in electricity production is where the market is heading, “there’s no reason you can’t do it” to continue digging up and burning coal, he said. 
Fix does not share Deti’s optimism. 
“Trump came in and gave carte blanche authority to the big coal corporations and said ‘the heck with all the little guys — all the guys working the land trying to make a living,’” Fix said. “Corporate America gets a bye, and the rest of us are going to have a hell of a time.”
He worries that more mining in the area will drive multi-generational ranchers off the land, but found some solace in the tricky economics of coal, which may keep mining companies from opening up new pits in the Powder River Basin. And he had a message for Trump and federal land managers who want more coal mining in the Powder River Basin. 
“Stop giving handouts to the corporate coal mines,” he said. “Don’t just take care of your rich friends. Take care of everyone.”

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)Department of Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy took questions from lawmakers on the Assembly Corrections Committee Tuesday, explaining the plan for Gov. Tony Evers’ about $500 million state budget request. 
Hoy previously defended the proposal to the Joint Finance Committee prior to which co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) had expressed concerns that the plan lacked detail.
About $325 million in Evers’ proposal would go to overhaul the state’s correctional facilities through a “domino” plan — starting with work to close Lincoln Hills School for Boys and Copper Lake School for Girls, which were initially supposed to close in 2021 under 2018 Act 185, and culminating in the closure of the Green Bay Correctional Institution. 
“There are a lot of issues with running facilities that are that old,” Hoy said about the Green Bay facility, which was built in 1898. It would cost about $6.3 million for the closure. “We shouldn’t be running prisons in that manner in 2025… We want to do more with our population than what those facilities can afford us to do.”
Under the plan, Waupun Correctional Institution would be closed temporarily for renovations, including replacing the existing cells with modern housing for 600 medium-security beds and establishing space for a “vocational village.” The work on Waupun would cost about $245.3 million and be ready to open in 2031.
“If we are going to keep Waupun open, we are going to completely flip the script. We are going to rewrite the narrative of Waupun,” Hoy said.
Hoy said that the idea wouldn’t be far from turning the Waupun facility into a “college campus” where inmates can receive vocational, career and technical education. 
“They’re living in community together. They’re going to school together. They’re studying in the evenings together, and it’s predicated on robust partnerships with the community so that we have manufacturers out in the community who come in to do the training on site,” Hoy said. 
Other infrastructure funding would include $130 million to complete construction of a Type 1 youth facility in Dane County, which would be necessary to close Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake schools, $9 million to convert Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake into a 500-bed facility for men, $8.8 million to convert Stanley Correctional Institution to a maximum-security institution and $56 million to expand Sanger B. Powers Correctional Center by 200 beds.
Committee Chair Rep. Dean Kaufert (R-Neenah) asked how DOC considered future budgets and whether there would be increases to the cost.
“It’s not the full cost of capital and programming for the future, so there’s a cost that is going to be harder to quantify when you build this, and you get it up and running,” Kaufert said.
Hoy said that closing Green Bay would actually represent a significant decrease in operating budget and updating Waupun would also lead to some decreases.
“Operating Waupun is quite cost prohibitive because [of] the number of staff that you need to run those aging facilities,” Hoy said. “Running a smaller facility at Waupun…requires less staffing, as well as shutting down Green Bay, your overall operating budget starts to offset [needing] more staff at Sanger Powers [Correctional Center]” to help with the additional beds.
Hoy also addressed some of the policy changes meant to address the growing prison population. Wisconsin’s prison population as of February was 23,074 and is expected to grow to 24,000 by the end of the biennium, despite the state only having capacity to house 17,638 people across its correctional facilities.
“About a third of our entire population is nonviolent in our prisons, and so we have existing programs that help people get the treatment, get the support and get them back out the door in a timely manner,” Hoy said. “One of the main mechanisms we have to do that at our disposal is the earned release program.” 
Evers’ plan would expand access to the state’s Earned Release Program to allow an additional 2,500 participants. The plan would expand access to workforce training and substance use treatment for people who have 48 months or less left in their sentences for nonviolent offenses  to support this. 
Rep. Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison) asked if the state is hitting a “tipping point” when it comes to its prison population. 
“Are we at the point of even thinking about sending people to other jails? Are we thinking about sending people out of state?” Stubbs asked. “Our incarceration numbers right now… are very high.” 
Hoys said that would be a “nuclear” option, given that it would take people away from their families and community. 
“I have no intention, no desire to send people out of state,” Hoys said, but added that “at some point our options are going to run out.” 
Hoys said DOC is leveraging jail contracts as much as it can and noted that one change that is being sought in the budget is an increase to the daily rate. Right now, he said the rate is capped at $60 a day and he wants that bumped to $80 to match the rate for federal inmates. 
“If I’m a sheriff and I’m looking at taking in-state guys versus federal guys or women for that matter, I’m going to choose the federal folks because the price tag [is] better,” Hoy said. “I want to be able to have that as a resource. Again, I’d like to keep everybody in our facilities as opposed to county jails, but that is a safety valve for us that we currently do utilize.” 
Kaufert, who was newly elected to his seat in November, noted that during his previous tenure in the state Legislature in the 1990s, lawmakers on the corrections committee toured facilities in other states where Wisconsin inmates were being held.
“I don’t want to make that mistake again,” Kaufert said. 
Rep. Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere) asked whether DOC would at least consider building a new facility to replace the Green Bay one. He added that he recently spoke to the Brown County sheriff, who said there are hundreds of people at home on ankle bracelets because there just isn’t enough space. 
“I want to commend the governor for acknowledging that that needs to go away — GBCI,” Franklin said. 
“We definitely did look… but to just replace Green Bay [maximum] facility — same size, same number of beds — you’re approaching a billion dollars, if not more,” Hoy said, adding that the state  also got an estimate of about $800 million for a smaller facility. 
“If I was looking across our population right now, and we were packed to the gills with violent offenders… I wouldn’t be saying, no, let’s not build anything. I’d be saying… we need to make sure our communities are safe and continue to house these people,” Hoy said. “But when I’m sitting on, you know, a third of 23,000 people that are non-violent… I believe it’s not only the right thing to do, but fiscally responsible to give those folks a chance in the community.” 
Rep. Jerry O’Connor (R-Fond Du Lac) asked how far up DOC is on Evers’ priority list. Noting the University of Wisconsin system budget and the public K-12 funding challenges, he said that everyone is seeking funding from the same pot of money. Wisconsin has a $4 billion budget surplus and Evers had suggested raising taxes on the wealthiest Wisconsinites. 
“I think we’re pretty close to the top, and I’m not just saying that because I’m the secretary of DOC. I mean I think it’s one of his biggest priorities,” Hoy said. 
Kaufert expressed interest in having more committee hearings with DOC about the plan. 
“There’s so many arms and legs on this that one impacts the other,” Kaufert said, adding that they could break it down to have more time to speak about all the pieces. He noted that if they are spending hundreds of millions and ending up with less beds, they better have “darn good answers” for taxpayers.

A modern Wyoming fable with a naked moral: Save all the parts.
The post A political conversation with a Mayan knife-fighter appeared first on WyoFile .","I bumped into my old friend Nicky Chiffon at the Clown’s Den south of Cheyenne the other night. We hadn’t seen each other in decades, so we had some catchin’ up to do. Back in the day, we stole horses and smuggled contraband together, so we had a bond.

Opinion

He is a strange cat, so I’ll have to explain Nicky to you. His ancestors were Mayan priests and priestesses, and they passed down to Nicky the secret rituals of human sacrifice as practiced in the Yucatan. When we first met, he was the reigning welterweight knife-fighting champion of the Caribbean.
Always a rabid Broncos fan, Nicky was heartbroken when John Elway retired, so he cloistered himself in a Maoist transgender nunnery in the Red Desert. He taught switchblade tactics to the sisters and dabbled in blackbone voodoo. He recently wore out his welcome and was 86ed from the convent for being “ideologically unsound,” hence our reunion.
We found a sticky little table in a dark corner of the strip joint and discussed the deconstructionist politics of 21st-century America as we sipped our Everclear smoothies. Nicky, an astute student of collapsed civilizations, waxed prophetic about the U. S. of A.
“You had it all, amigo. You built it up ‘til you were on top of the pyramid. And now you’re tearing it all down just because some weird rich guy is pissed off at everything. The feathered serpent god is not pleased, compadre.” Nicky sucked on his straw with hollowed cheeks, and added, “I see dark days ahead, if you don’t wake up pronto. Dark days.”
I looked nonplussed, so he continued. “Think about it, cabrón. You fought a revolution so common people could have power, and now you’re giving that power to wealthy corporations. Caramba! How stupid is that?”
That made me take a big slug from my own glass of Everclear.
“It took you 250 years to create all these magnificent democratic institutions,” he said, “and now you’re getting rid of them because they annoy the upper class. See what I mean?”
I asked Nicky for specific examples.
“Okay,” he said, rising to the task. “The U.S. is supposed to be a country that welcomes new ideas, right? Americans always say they support freedom of thought and expression.” I must have nodded in agreement, because he went on. “Then why are you allowing the government to ban books and accuse libraries of sedition, just because powerful oligarchs don’t like what’s written down? That don’t make no sense.”
I ordered another round as Nicky warmed to the subject.
“And you created the judicial branch so that you’d be governed by laws, not a king. But here you are, arresting judges just because they don’t toe a political line. What would your Founding Fathers think about that horseshit?”
Nicky’s brow sweated and veins throbbed at his temple when he said, “And you stand around like peasants when your president threatens to jail anyone who protests against him. It’s almost like you’re willing to pay extra for British tea these days.”
At that point, the jukebox began playing Dylan’s “The Times They Are A-Changin’” and the stripper slowly twirled around her pole.
“Listen, Nicky,” I said, “these are changing times. Don’t be so hard on us.”
“Times change, sí. But some things shouldn’t.” He regarded me with those obsidian Mayan eyes. “If you throw away everything that made you great, you discard your foundation. Then your civilization is built on quicksand or goat manure. If something needs fixed, then fix it. But the first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the parts.”
Nicky’s straw made a slurping sound as he sucked up the last of his hooch. He banged his fist on the table for more and said, “My grandpa taught me that rule. I bet yours did, too. If my ancestors, the Mayans, or even the Romans, or the Sumerians, had followed that rule, they’d still be around today. Don’t throw away the good stuff!”
We tried to drink the Clown’s Den dry that night, and in our younger days, we could have. But we have mellowed with age, Nicky Chiffon and I, so we stumbled out the door and parted with our secret handshake. Nicky limped off to his next adventure, while I stood gazing up into the dark American night.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Smart, progressive women pose a serious threat to MAGA supremacy. Just ask Elon Musk, who wasted millions of dollars in Wisconsin trying to win a seat on the state Supreme Court for MAGA candidate Brad Schimel, only to watch Susan Crawford clean Schimel’s clock.
From his first presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016, “Lock her up!” has been Donald Trump’s battle cry. Restoring the greatness of a white, male-dominated America apparently requires menacing displays of dominance over women in positions of authority. Who can forget Trump acting like a stalker, invading Clinton’s personal space and looming behind her during a 2016 debate?
On Friday, a few weeks after MAGA lost its bid to disempower the progressive female majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the Trump administration sent federal agents to arrest Hannah Dugan at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Trump’s attorney general and the man he chose to lead the FBI gleefully posted pictures of Dugan’s “perp walk” in handcuffs, crowing about this unprecedented assault on the dignity and authority of a judge and the sovereignty of local courts.
On Tuesday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Dugan. “In order to uphold the public’s confidence in the courts of this state during the pendency of the criminal proceeding against Judge Dugan, we conclude, on our own motion, that it is in the public interest that she be temporarily relieved of her official duties,” the state’s highest court said in a two-page letter ordering Judge Dugan “temporarily prohibited from exercising the powers of a circuit court judge.”
It’s a perplexing decision. It didn’t arise from any complaint; the Court acted on its own. And Dugan had already been relieved of her duties while she focuses on her defense by the chief judge in Milwaukee, who assigned her calendar to other judges to cover.
Worse, the suspension gives the impression that the federal charges against Dugan are indeed serious. But that impression is not supported by the only evidence the government has produced.
The justification for Dugan’s arrest, laid out in a federal criminal complaint, is that she impeded federal law enforcement agents when she objected to ICE disrupting her court’s proceedings and ushered the man they came to arrest out a side door. The defendant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who was appearing before Dugan on a misdemeanor battery charge unrelated to his immigration status, exited into the public hallway where the agents were waiting for him. Then they followed him outside and made their arrest — unimpeded.
Fox News claimed Dugan concealed Flores-Ruiz in a jury room. But that assertion is contradicted by the sworn testimony in the government’s own criminal complaint. 
The complaint features breathlessly sexist descriptions of Dugan appearing “visibly angry” and “walking quickly,” as if that were evidence of wrongdoing. But any actual wrongdoing is hard to pinpoint.
“Whatever you think of the actual conduct the complaint alleges,” says Dean Strang, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and a long-time Wisconsin criminal defense lawyer, “there is a real question about whether there’s even arguably any federal crime here.” 
The government’s behavior, meanwhile, is “extraordinarily atypical,” for a nonviolent, nondrug charge involving someone who is not a flight risk, says Strang.
The handcuffs, the public arrest at Dugan’s workplace, the media circus — none of it was normal, or justified. Then Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel began posting pictures of Dugan in handcuffs on social media to brag about it.
“So what is it they are trying to do?” asks Strang. His conclusion: “Humiliate and terrify, not just her but every other judge in the country.”
The bigger issue here, beyond an unprecedented, public display of dominance and intimidation by the Trump administration, is that, in turning federal law enforcement into an arm of his personal, vengeance-themed reality show, Trump is running roughshod over the constitutional principle of federalism, which respects the sovereignty of the states, the integrity of the courts and public safety. Scaring defendants, witnesses and victims away from making court appearances makes it harder to administer justice and makes all of us less safe.
But you’d never know that to listen to Republican state officials, who are championing federal agents barging into courts, schools and churches, forgetting everything they ever said about local control and states’ rights. In a letter released Tuesday, Assembly Republicans led by Speaker Robin Vos sent a letter to Gov. Tony Evers, declaring “our caucus believes it is imperative that our laws reflect the need for local law enforcement to comply with these efforts.”
Republicans accuse Evers of issuing guidance to state officials that impedes federal ICE raids.
 “Unfortunately, recent events in Milwaukee have underscored the importance for our state to legislate and enforce compliance with federal immigration law,” their letter declares, citing Dugan’s arrest.
The Republicans demand that Evers rescind guidance telling state agencies that they need not answer questions, hand over files, or allow ICE to enter non-public areas without a warrant.
Capitulating to an administration that has admitted to deporting U.S. citizens and defied court orders to effect the return of a man it admits was mistakenly sent to a Salvadoran prison is a terrible idea. Big law firms that agreed to drop clients and offer free legal work to appease the Trump administration have eroded trust in the law. Authoritarian undermining of our legal system is a grave danger.
The least the most timid among us can do is insist that the federal government follow the law before caving in. That’s what Dugan did, when she asked if the agents who came to her courtroom to arrest Flores-Ruiz had a judicial warrant. They did not. Nor do they have proof that Dugan herself broke any laws.
The last thing we need right now is more capitulation to MAGA bullying. Stand strong.

Applicants for REAL IDs need to provide the Department of Finance and Administration with four different forms of identification:

A current driver’s license, state-issued ID, or school or work ID as proof of identity
A passport or birth certificate as proof of legal presence in the United States
A government-issued social security card
Two documents providing proof of address, such as utility bills or bank statements, issued within the last six months

The documents “all have to sync up,” Finance Secretary Jim Hudson said last week.
Transgender and nonbinary Arkansans might have changed their names or gender information on some but not all legal documents, and state policies have made it difficult for these groups of people to obtain documents that accurately reflect who they are, advocates say. Birth certificates can be legally altered, and until this year, the federal government allowed gender-neutral information on U.S. passports.
“The government has played politics with people’s lives and upended people’s ability to accurately and properly identify themselves,” said Holly Dickson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas. “This has created much chaos and turmoil for no good reason while making life harder and more unsafe for all of us.”
Last year, the ACLU of Arkansas led a lawsuit against the DFA’s decision to stop issuing gender-neutral driver’s licenses. The case was dropped after Arkansas officials permanently adopted the new policy, which prohibits the use of an “X” to indicate someone’s gender in place of “M” or “F.”
Arkansans urge state finance department not to reverse gender-neutral driver’s license policy

Several transgender and nonbinary Arkansans, including Maggs Gallup of Little Rock, urged the finance department to maintain the previous policy, which had been in place for 14 years. Gallup said in an interview Monday that they are putting off obtaining a REAL ID in case doing so requires the state to remove the X gender marker from their driver’s license.
Hudson told lawmakers that a driver’s license is “not a platform for speech” and “not a platform for personal identity.” Gallup disagreed, saying their gender-neutral ID is important to them and putting incorrect information on an ID is “a deeply incongruent thing to do.”
“In an ideal world, it would be great to have the state and officials recognize our gender,” Gallup said. “They don’t get to determine who we are, no matter what letters we put on our IDs.”
REAL IDs began with a law passed by Congress in 2005 as a response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Instituting REAL IDs statewide “will help fight terrorism and reduce identity fraud,” according to the finance department website.
The federal Transportation Security Administration accepts passports in place of REAL IDs as identification to board a flight. Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, a well-known transgender advocate who lives in Little Rock, said last week on Facebook that she was initially denied access to a flight because she has an X on her driver’s license, but she was allowed to board after displaying her passport containing a male gender marker.
Griffin-Gracy is 78 years old and gender-nonconforming, and she was present at the 1969 Stonewall riot between LGBTQ+ people and police in New York City. In her Facebook video, she expressed disbelief that her passport was accepted even though she did not appear masculine. She also said “we the people” should “stand up and fight” President Donald Trump’s administration, which does not recognize gender-neutral IDs.

Bill regulating transgender Arkansans’ bathroom use heads to House despite public pushback

“This is just one part of a larger, really complicated network of new rules and legislation that are challenging to navigate” for transgender and nonbinary Arkansans, Gallup said.
State lawmakers and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders approved a law this month that will allow Arkansans to sue for damages if they encounter someone in a bathroom, changing room, shelter or correctional facility who does not align with the “designated sex” of the space.
The state has also enacted laws in the past few years that ban transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, require public school students to use bathrooms that match their gender assigned at birth, regulate pronoun use in schools and allow doctors who provide transgender minors’ health care to be sued for medical malpractice.

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signs state’s largest income tax cut into law

The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”













It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state.


– David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst





Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said. That includes Idaho.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Dominated by a series of tax cuts, Idaho Legislature adjourns 2025 legislative session

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville with attorney Ben Rose, left. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The trio charged in a Tennessee political corruption case shared text messages in early 2020 complaining about the state’s failure to pay a mysterious vendor for work on lawmakers’ constituent mailers, at one point cursing the administrator in charge of handling invoices.
One text message from former Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson to ex-Speaker of the House Glen Casada said, “Connie’s a bi—.” Casada responded, “Agreed!”
Smith, who pleaded guilty in the fraud and kickback case and is cooperating with federal prosecutors, was referring to now-retired Legislative Administration Director Connie Ridley, who handled payments for the state’s postage and printing program for lawmakers. Ridley held up payments because of problems with W-9 tax forms by the vendor, Phoenix Solutions, which was run by former legislative aide Cade Cothren, and Casada, testimony showed.
Smith testified she was “highly frustrated” because Ridley approved work without having the federal tax documents on hand. Eventually, Cothren sent the state a W-9 signed as “Matthew Phoenix,” one of the key documents prosecutors are using in the case to show deception by Smith, Casada and Cothren to direct business to Phoenix Solutions without state officials or lawmakers knowing who was behind the company.
Casada and Cothren had stepped down from their posts at different points in 2019 because of a racist and sexist texting scandal. Casada remained in the General Assembly but not as House speaker.

Another text displayed for the jury Tuesday showed the state had paid for work on a lawmaker’s constituent mailer but didn’t include taxes.
Smith and Cothren sent each other “incredulous” text messages and Smith added another one saying, “Quite the bullsh–.”
Smith, former chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, met with Ridley to speed up payments in February 2020 when the state owed Phoenix Solutions $34,000 for work on several Republican lawmakers’ constituent mailers, including now-former Rep. Patsy Hazlewood of Signal Mountain, Rep. Dan Howell of Cleveland, Rep. Esther Helton-Haynes of East Ridge, Rep. Dennis Powers of Jacksboro, Rep. Susan Lynn of Mt. Juliet, Rep. Bud Hulsey of Bristol, Rep. Chris Hurt of Halls, Rep. Andrew Farmer of Sevierville and Smith and Casada.
Ridley testified earlier this week she didn’t find out Phoenix Solutions was run by Cothren until May 2020 when federal authorities told her to continue processing the New Mexico-based company’s invoices.
Earlier Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson ruled that prosecutors can present evidence showing the trio wanted to expand from constituent mailers, which are paid for with tax money, to House Republican Caucus work. Defense attorneys argued that the prosecutors should be limited to evidence about the postage and printing program because it is outlined in the indictment, not an effort to tap into caucus funds.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Casada-4-29-25-004-1024x778.jpg,,,2025-04-30 06:06:12.368474

(Photo: Getty Images)Let’s talk weed! You know, pot, grass, dope, herb, skunk, ganja, reefer, maryjane, cheeba. (Cheeba?) Always on brand, Republicans at the state capitol put the bulk of their energy during the session that just wrapped pursuing craven new ways to ravage immigrant families and bully non-straight-white people. But they did manage to spare some time for the subject of cannabis, resulting in adoption of a big clunker of a new wacky baccy regulatory scheme.
The cannabis state of play in Tennessee is strange and confusing, as those who produce or partake understand but others may not fully appreciate. Ours is among the minority of states where marijuana remains wholly illegal to cultivate, distribute, or possess, even for medical purposes, with criminal penalties for violations. And yet forms of cannabis that will get you plenty stoned are readily available in several forms for perfectly legal purchase and use.
The simple story of how this came to be: The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the definition of marijuana in federal law. Hemp plants are cannabis plants with very low concentrations of THC: under 0.3% means it’s “hemp” and it’s legal everywhere, while over 0.3% makes it “marijuana,” a controlled substance in federal law. And just as hemp as a plant isn’t illegal in legislatively pot-hostile places like Tennessee, neither are its constituent compounds, like the (very small amount of) THC it contains.
Hemp industry fears slate of restrictive bills could gut industry

That led enterprising ganjapreneurs to figure out how to extract THC from low-THC hemp and embed it in the kinds of cannabis products (like edible gummies and smokable concentrates) found in states with full legalization. To avoid getting too deep in the weeds (yes I went there and I’m not proud of it) I’m omitting details around THC variations THCa, delta 8. and delta 9). The point is you can buy a gummy with 10 mg of THC in Metropolis, Illinois where recreational marijuana is legal, or you can buy a 10 mg gummy in Nashville where it isn’t, and both will do the trick. The difference is that in Tennessee the ingredients will say “hemp-derived THC.”
The Tennessee Legislature waded into this free-for-all of stoner innovation two years ago with a bill regulating the production and distribution of “hemp-derived cannabinoids.” With bipartisan support, the 2023 measure created licensing, testing, labeling, and selling requirements for hemp-derived products, spelled out criminal offenses for violations, and put in place a tax on sales to fund enforcement. Sure sounds like regulation, right?
Yet just two years later GOP lawmakers said we have unregulated recreational pot, so they wrote this year’s big do-over bill adding new regulations, levying new taxes, and shifting enforcement of the whole shebang to a different part of state government. Most significantly, it narrows the definition of hemp-derived products in ways that may force the industry to abandon some offerings (until they figure out how to innovate around it).
In Senate committee testimony back in February, two hemp-related business owners said the bill will “wipe out” their industry. Looking at the specifics of the bill and the composition of their products I’d say “wipe out the industry” is a tad hyperbolic, but hempsters are not wrong to call the bill a recklessly crafted threat to a growing industry that contributes meaningfully to the state’s agricultural (and jamband) economy.
The backers of this year’s bill blended reefer madness tactics with puzzling non sequiturs to justify their crackdown. “I think the public does believe that small children should not be taking this,” Sen. Richard Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, freely associated with the committee last month. Apropos of who-the-hell-knows-what, Briggs lamented on the Senate floor ahead of final passage that the pot was much mellower at Woodstock compared to what you find now in Nashville. On the House side, sponsor Rep. William Lamberth, a Portland Republican,) declared that “what we do with these products can change lives for the better or worse significantly.” I have no idea what that means.

The arguments for keeping Tennessee in the column of retrograde states afraid of adult recreational pot may be murky, but there is clarity in public opinion on the other side. A Vanderbilt poll in late 2024 shows Tennessee voters favoring legalization for recreational use by almost two to one (a 63-36% margin), including majorities of both Republicans (53%) and Democrats (78%). Back in 2018 support for recreational access was just 37% in an MTSU poll, so Tennesseans have come a long way on this issue as they have watched other states legalize.
The Tennessee state house is practiced at legislating against majority preferences, a relevant option when an issue stretches tensions between individual rights and collective will. But legal pot is not that sort of issue—there are no relevant rights in play (other than the right to not consume cannabis, which needs no protection).
Tennessee is hardly the first state where elected lawmakers resist treating their adult citizens like adults on this issue. Of the more than two-dozen states that have legalized recreational weed, many got it done by going around their legislatures to legalize it through voter ballot initiative. There is little doubt that would work here as well — except for the pesky little fact that Tennessee’s constitution allows no citizen-activated ballot initiatives ever on any subject. So instead we’re stuck with a feckless legislature that chooses nanny-state provincialism over giving the people what they want. And what they want is to not have to drive to Metropolis, Illinois.

(Photo by ICE)Lawmakers in the North Carolina House voted Tuesday to expand requirements for county sheriffs to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a move that Republicans say closes “loopholes” in an immigration law passed last year.
The 2024 law required sheriffs to comply with ICE “detainers” — or requests to notify the agency before an undocumented immigrant is released from law enforcement’s custody, regardless of whether they are convicted.
House Bill 318 expands on that requirement, forcing sheriffs to contact ICE in cases where a person is charged with any felony, as well as high-level misdemeanors. And it requires the sheriffs to notify the agency when a detainer is about to expire.
The bill intends to root out “loopholes” that Republicans say several sheriffs have used to avoid complying with ICE — most prominently in Mecklenburg County, where the city of Charlotte is located.
“We’re closing loopholes because five or so sheriffs have refused to cooperate,” said Rep. Brian Echevarria (R-Cabarrus).
Democratic opponents to the bill called it a violation of due process.
“You cannot detain your way to public safety,” said Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake), who recounted Tuesday her experience of being stopped on the road by law enforcement and threatened with ICE detention, despite being born in the U.S.

However, they’re noticeably absent throughout the Midwest. Local community leaders in Cleveland have called on the city to create an office of gun violence prevention, stating that a permanent investment in an office would make their work more effective. 
(Photo by Daniel Lozada for The Trace)This story was published in partnership with The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom covering gun violence.
In February, 10-year-old Lorenzo Roberson, dressed in a suit and tie, spoke passionately at a town hall meeting in Cleveland. He was there to address city leaders about how he and other kids feel about safety in their neighborhoods. Most importantly, though, he was there to remember his best friend, Kaden Coleman, who was shot and killed that same month as he sat in the backseat of a car in Mount Pleasant, eight miles south of downtown Cleveland.  
“I am Kaden because his spirit now lives within me. I am Kaden because I am 10 years old, too; I get good grades, too,” Lorenzo told a mix of residents and elected officials. “Will I have a chance to survive? Will my life be cut short, too?”
Then he posed a challenge to the audience: “Will the adults in this room make sure that I have a chance to grow?” 
His call for safety in the face of rising shooting rates among young people reflects the pervasive fear among people who live in Cleveland’s most turbulent neighborhoods, including Mount Pleasant, where Lorenzo lives. Despite a recent decline in shootings across the city, a handful of neighborhoods — Central, East Cleveland, Mount Pleasant and others  — experience disproportionate levels of violence. Homicide rates in those areas range from 25 to 57 per 100,000 residents compared to places that are as low as 0 to 15. All of the struggling neighborhoods are majority Black. 
To combat the burden of shootings on those communities, local leaders and activists have worked hard for decades to fill gaps, establishing intervention and prevention programs, doing outreach work among young people, and providing mental health support to those in need. Those methods seem to have contributed to the city’s overall decline, especially in the last few years. 
But people working to tackle gun crimes in Cleveland said local groups have fallen into silos as they each vie for funding, creating a competitive, uncoordinated response that they see as inadequate for addressing the shifting crisis. A localized Office of Gun Violence Prevention, they said, would help address that isolation — and curb shootings.
“We’ve seen how successful (these types of offices) have been in other cities. I think it would make a real difference,” said Laron Douglas, the executive director of Renounce Denounce, a community-based gang intervention program that works with kids in Cleveland.
Many cities across the country have created offices of gun violence prevention over the past several years. They coordinate local initiatives, fund programs, and help drive policy changes. Since President Donald Trump eliminated the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention in his first month in office, dozens of municipalities are proposing or creating their own, but local offices are notably scarce throughout the Midwest, where gun violence rates are higher than in some of the country’s largest cities. Several states in the region, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Wisconsin, have successfully established them; Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is located, is one of the few counties to host one. 
“Having one dedicated gun violence prevention office will make us more intentional. The office would be able to call a family and deploy resources effectively,” said Myesha Watkins, who runs the Cleveland Peacemakers Alliance, an anti-violence group established in 2009 among a handful of still-active community groups. “There’s too many people who don’t know where to go for gun violence prevention.”

Cleveland has also deployed a street outreach team from the Community Relations Board to do violence intervention work, and the Neighborhood Resources and Recreational Centers are involved with providing activity space for kids. 
Those efforts are helpful, but they’re not strategic enough, said City Council Member Richard Starr, who is a native of Central and represents several neighborhoods struggling with gun violence. “They don’t have a plan right now,” Starr said, noting the city’s handful of initiatives but lack of a concrete plan for tackling gun violence or measuring its trajectory. 
According to city data, Cleveland had a firearm death rate of 45 per 100,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year full data is available, an increase from 39 in 2022. In 2024, homicides declined to 113, from 156 in 2023, according to data from the city’s police department. Still, residents warn that the data doesn’t tell the full story. 
Data is “either going to create chaos or it’s going to create hope, and depending on the narrative, it can do either or it can do both,” Watkins said. “If we’re talking about our community members, they’ll see a post that homicides are down, but they’re not feeling that when they walk outside their homes.” 
Local leaders say the encouraging numbers shouldn’t dissuade engaged citizens from creating an office of violence prevention, especially when considering the areas most affected. Michael Houser, the Cuyahoga County Council Member for District 10, which includes some of Cleveland’s most gun violence-plagued neighborhoods, including East Cleveland, Cleveland Heights, and St. Clair Superior, has been pushing the county to build an office of violence prevention since his election last year, and hopes to work in partnership with Starr at the city-level to create one. 
The County Council is in talks to create one, but the question is how they’re going to fund it. “We find money to fund everything else,” Houser said. “So hopefully we will be able to find the funding for this very important initiative.” 
In Cleveland, Council Member Starr led the effort to declare gun violence a public health crisis, legislation which passed in the city council yesterday. Starr will now be able to use state and federal resources to fund an office. “You look at some of these other cities, they have plans and investment in how they’re going to curb violence. Cleveland is behind on that,” Starr said, pointing to Columbus, one of the few Midwest cities to have such an office.
Since its municipal office was created in 2023, Columbus has achieved what Starr and others hope to. They’ve taken a public health approach to gun violence, helped coordinate and strategize violence reduction programming between different local groups, and begun to measure and assess their progress (a report is coming in the next few months). 
“Columbus is flooded with (violence intervention groups) and we needed a way to streamline these groups to make sure they’re most effective and have access to funding,” said Rena Shak, the executive director of the Office of Violence Prevention in Columbus.  
That sort of strategizing is exactly what people want to see in Cleveland. 
“We have individuals and we have groups doing great work, but we need to find a way to bring people together,” said Michelle Bell, founder of M-PAC Cleveland, which provides resources to families and friends who’ve lost loved ones to gun violence. Bell remembers feeling like there was nowhere to turn after her son was shot and killed in 2019. “If people are saying we need this office, our officials and local leaders need to listen.”

Whether you’re running a small business, managing a classroom, serving in public office or raising a family, you’ve likely seen firsthand how quickly circumstances can change. At Idaho State University, we feel it too. But rather than retreat in the face of uncertainty, or freeze in place, we’re leaning in with courage, creativity and a deep sense of responsibility to the state of Idaho and its communities. 
Nowhere is that more evident than in ISU’s L.S. Skaggs College of Pharmacy, serving Idaho for over 100 years. 
Like many professional programs nationwide, market pressures in the pharmacy industry have caused enrollment declines over the past decade. For a state like Idaho, where access to health care is already strained, this is a serious concern. 
Many pharmacy programs in the U.S. have tried to just weather the storm, unwilling to respond or adapt. At ISU, forward-thinking administrators and faculty got to work. They asked hard questions, made tough decisions and reimagined what the future could look like. They pivoted. 
For the College of Pharmacy, their strategy in the face of enrollment changes was both simple and bold: tighten the belt, focus on excellence and stay true to our mission. The college began a multi-year “step-down” budget process to right-size operations while protecting core programs and positions. They eliminated vacancies through attrition, restructured contracts and found smart ways to reduce overhead and adjust student cohort sizes. Every decision was guided by a commitment to students, principles and patients, not bureaucracy or maintaining the status quo. 
And it’s working. Through disciplined planning, ISU’s College of Pharmacy is not only financially stable, but it’s innovating and thriving in a new environment while continuing to graduate skilled professionals. 
Take, for example, their expansion of clinical psychopharmacology. This master’s degree program trains licensed psychologists to prescribe medication safely and effectively, especially in underserved areas. Today, we have 22 students enrolled from across the country, and demand continues to grow. That’s a real impact, rooted in local need and national relevance. 
Or look at our hybrid delivery model. With campuses in Pocatello, Meridian and Anchorage, Alaska, in partnership with the University of Alaska Anchorage, our faculty teach and collaborate across thousands of miles, supporting students in rural communities and building tight-knit teams that defy geographic boundaries. They’ve turned a challenge into a strength.
What we’ve learned from ISU’s College of Pharmacy applies far beyond higher education. When circumstances shift, we can’t cling to the way things used to be. We need leaders at every level who are willing to adapt, focus on purpose and move forward with faith in the future. It also requires confidence in the mission and knowing what not to sacrifice or give up in pursuit of making a positive difference. 
At Idaho State University, our purpose is clear. We exist to serve Idaho. We prepare the next generation of pharmacists, nurses, teachers, engineers and business leaders while contributing to the creative arts and producing impactful research. We provide a return on investment that benefits every community, and we do this with fewer resources than most universities of our size. 
This year, as Idahoans consider the future of education and government, I hope our story adds something meaningful to the conversation. Higher education institutions can adapt; we can pivot while being true to the most important aspects of an educational mission. At our best, we are nimble, practical and deeply committed to solving real problems and contributing to society. 
We’re not perfect. But we’re listening. We’re learning. And we’re leading. 
In uncertain times, leadership isn’t about being the loudest voice in the room. It’s about showing up, making hard, but principled decisions, and exhibiting strength through resiliency. Because perseverance in tough times doesn’t just steady the ship, it charts a better, bolder course for the future.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.


Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)NEW ORLEANS – The City Council committee voted Monday to advance an ordinance that protects sex workers from prosecution and arrest when reporting a crime and to prevent admittance of condom possession as evidence for prostitution.
All four council members at Monday’s joint meeting of the Governmental Affairs and Community Development committees — Helena Moreno, J.P. Morrell, Lesli Harris and Freddie King — voted to recommend the ordinance to the full council for final passage.
The ordinance, which was introduced by Councilmembers Lesli Harris and Helena Moreno, was added to the council’s consent agenda for its May 8 regular meeting, where it is expected to pass. Consent agenda items typically pass without debate.
During Monday’s hearing, Moreno said the ordinance was drafted in consultation with the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office and the New Orleans Police Department. Neither agency responded to Verite News’ requests for comment on the proposal.
The ordinance would codify into city law an internal NOPD policy meant to encourage victims of violent crimes to cooperate with police investigations. Under the policy, victims and witnesses that police encounter during a criminal investigation cannot be arrested for sex work-related violations.
Prostitution arrests have already drastically decreased in the city over the past several years. But NOPD enforcement priorities can be changed more easily than laws. Natalie Rupp, the executive director of the Trans Income Project, said the ordinance will protect the trans and sex worker community over the long term.
“Currently, if you are a sex worker who is working and you say, ‘I was raped’ or ‘I was robbed,’ and you just try to describe the scenario, you can be arrested for prostitution,” Rupp said before the committee meeting.
The Trans Income Project held a series of community meetings last year with trans people. Rupp said attendees expressed deep concern about being profiled for being trans and arrested for prostitution. A large share of trans women report having worked in the sex industry at some point in their lives, making the ordinance a “gay-specific issue,” said Rupp.
Those worries prompted the push for the proposed ordinance. Rupp said sex workers have no access to protective services if crimes are committed against them, an issue the ordinance would help alleviate.
“It is our firm belief that regardless of what you do for a living, you deserve the right to report a crime that occurred to you,” Rupp said. “We don’t say that because you’re a barista and you handed someone coffee, well, then, ‘What did you expect? Of course, they beat you up and stole your money.’ Like that is just a no-brainer.”
But if it passes, the law would only apply to the NOPD.
As a municipal law, the proposal would carry no authority over other law enforcement agencies operating in the city under the state’s jurisdiction. That includes Troop NOLA, the permanent contingent of Louisiana State Police troopers deployed to New Orleans last year under orders from Gov. Jeff Landry — with enthusiastic support from New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell.
Moreno, the City Council’s vice president and a likely frontrunner in this fall’s mayoral election, did not respond to questions about how sex workers would be affected by the State Police presence in the city.
“I only have authority over local government,” Moreno wrote. “The ordinance as written can provide more clarity on how the state allows local municipalities discretion to handle certain offenses.”
Ordinance does not cover Troop NOLA
It’s not clear how Troop NOLA will respond to the ordinance should it pass. Asked whether Troop NOLA would follow the municipal code when policing in the city, State Police spokesperson Kate Stegall only noted that the troop follows only state law.
“Louisiana State Troopers are responsible for enforcing state laws across the state,” Stegall wrote in an email. “Local municipal ordinances are enforced by the police department within that specific jurisdiction.”
As Verite News reported last October, there is no formal public agreement between city and state governments about how Troop NOLA should be deployed.
Troop NOLA’s actions have sometimes been opposed to directives of local leadership, most notably in the days leading up to a series of Taylor Swift concerts at the Superdome last October, when state troopers abruptly cleared a number of homeless encampments over the objections of the city government. Troop NOLA has also come under fire for repeatedly engaging in high-speed chases for minor crimes, nonviolent crimes; a tactic NOPD can only use to pursue violent suspects under a long-running federal consent decree and departmental policy.
Still, city leaders such as Cantrell and NOPD Chief Anne Kirkpatrick have largely embraced the state’s policing efforts in the city.
And although the ordinance would prevent sex workers from being prosecuted by the local government, those arrested by the state will also be prosecuted by the state under state law. Last year, Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams inked an agreement with state Attorney General Liz Murrill that allows the Attorney General’s Office to prosecute people arrested in New Orleans by State Police troopers.
Neither Williams’ nor Murill’s offices responded to requests for comment on the proposed ordinance.
Under Louisiana state law, sex workers found guilty of prostitution could face fines and jail time. If someone has prior convictions, they can be imprisoned for at least four years and be fined between $500 to $4,000.
Preserving a ‘right to safe sex’
Attorney Lauren Hall, an attorney and co-founder of Below Sea Level Aid, drafted the language of the ordinance and said she wants to see a similar one passed at the state level, which would then protect sex workers across Louisiana.
“We’re not legalizing prostitution,” Hall said. “We’re just protecting sex workers who are victims of crimes, who seek medical treatment and who go to the police for help. It prevents them from being arrested based on prostitution, and it prevents them from being prosecuted based on this alone.”
The ordinance also includes what Hall called “a right to safe sex,” which means that police cannot use condoms as evidence for prostitution. A Human Rights Watch survey from 2013 found that 26% of sex workers in New Orleans who were interviewed were harassed by police for carrying condoms and that more than half of them were trans women. More than 50% of respondents said they carried fewer condoms in fear of getting in trouble with police.
Corinne Green, a board member of the Trans Income Project who worked on the ordinance, said community members commonly brought up fear of interacting with law enforcement in meetings. Green said that trans people are also afraid of being profiled as sex workers.
“Just simple possession of condoms as evidence of prostitution was a huge issue and really impacted people’s willingness to interact with law enforcement and also their experiences when they did,” Green said.
The ordinance drew inspiration from Louisiana’s revamped “Good Samaritan Law,” which protects people experiencing drug-related overdoses from arrest, prosecution and penalization, Green said.
Dozens of community members and organizers spoke in favor of the ordinance during public comment.
“Everyone has the right to protect themselves,” said Deon Haywood, the executive director of the nonprofit women’s rights group Women with a Vision, during public comment at the committee meeting. She has worked on behalf of sex workers for more than 35 years. “Every single person has a right to carry what they need to, and it should not be at the police discretion because someone is carrying condoms.”

Hepp pleaded no contest.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
In June, Hepp was charged in Maier’s death. Maier’s mother sued Wisconsin Department of Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy, Hepp and others Monday, seeking compensatory and punitive damages. 
The lawsuit alleges that the defendants’ “lack of accommodation, deliberate indifference, and negligence in ignoring his rapidly and obviously deteriorating physical and mental health while he was in their care” caused Maier’s death. 
In June, the Examiner reported that Hepp and eight members of his staff had been charged with crimes related to the treatment of people incarcerated in the prison. Six staff members were charged along with Hepp in the death of Maier, who authorities said died due to dehydration and malnutrition, the Examiner reported in June. Seven incarcerated people have died at WCI since 2023, the Associated Press reported. 
A statement in a criminal complaint said Hepp didn’t oversee his staff to make sure they followed all policies/procedures. 
“Randall Hepp did not follow through the requirements of his position required by law as the staff at WCI are poorly trained on many policies and procedures regarding missed meal(s), water restrictions, medication refusals, round checks, and more,” the complaint stated. 
DA, Maier lawsuit tell different stories about Hepp
Earlier in the case, Hepp was charged with felony misconduct in public office. Penalties for a Class I felony are a fine up to $10,000 or up to three and a half years’ imprisonment, or both.

Hepp was convicted of violating law governing state or county institutions. The Class C misdemeanor comes with a fine up to $500 and up to 30 days imprisonment, or both. Hepp was not sentenced to imprisonment.
The Associated Press reported that Dodge County Circuit Court Judge Martin De Vries cited Hepp’s service record, lack of a criminal record and “‘subpar employees’” who failed to follow policy. 
Dodge County District Attorney Andrea Will lowered the charge to a misdemeanor in exchange for a no contest plea, the AP reported. Will told De Vries that she lowered the charge because Hepp was well respected within the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and didn’t know guards weren’t following policy, according to the AP. 
De Vries said the criminal charge against Hepp was “‘to some extent…symbolic,” the Post-Crescent reported. 
According to the Associated Press, Maier’s mother, Jeannette Maier, called Hepp’s sentence a “‘slap on the wrist.’” She said her son had been treated worse than a caged animal.  
“Nothing can bring my son back but I like to think we as a society would at least learn something from this tragedy so it never happens to someone else’s son,” she said in a statement, according to the AP.  
The lawsuit from Jeannette Maier alleges Hepp was aware of a “systemic lapse in enforcement” of the hunger strike and water shut-off protocols. It alleges that Hepp did not take action to attempt to make sure that the protocols were followed. 
The lawsuit also says Hepp was deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk regarding the most at-risk incarcerated people in the restricted housing unit. 
The risk, as described by the lawsuit, was that they were not receiving the level of care and supervision needed in order to afford them adequate medical and mental health evaluation and treatment and did not have humane conditions of confinement.  
This risk was created by understaffing, low morale and lack of adequate training, the lawsuit alleges. 
Sheriff supports conviction
Dodge County Sheriff Dale Schmidt released a statement on Facebook in support of the settlement and conviction. 
“I can understand why some may feel additional sanctions are warranted, but our court system must be blind to ‘feelings’ and ‘agendas’ and decisions made solely on the facts of the case,” Schmidt said. 
Schmidt said that “investigating and arresting Randall Hepp was one of the most difficult cases I have been part of, leading to some of the most difficult decisions I have had to make during my time as sheriff.” He said Gov. Tony Evers and then-Department of Corrections Secretary Kevin Carr put Hepp in a very difficult position. 
“Don’t get me wrong, he was the warden and was by law administratively responsible for Waupun Correctional Institution, and as a result, two deaths that occurred,” Schmidt said. “While we explored it, no Wisconsin or federal law directly tied back to his bosses, who failed to provide adequate resources or leadership.”
A sentencing memorandum by an attorney for Hepp said the former warden “was chosen to run Waupun because of his history of building great work environments and teams, creating positive institution culture and improving operations.” 
According to the memorandum, “Waupun Correctional was known to be the most challenging institution for correctional officers to work.”
“This institution was in complete [dysfunction], there was an extreme understaffing of uniformed positions and no goal to improve the staffing,” the memorandum stated. “There was a historically high vacancy rate that existed over a lengthy period of time that required officers to work an extremely unheard-of number of forced shifts further aggravating an already difficult situation and burning out among staff members. This situation contributed to the staff’s concerning level of apathy, distraction and a desire to transfer to other institutions.”
The memorandum said Hepp “became the primary and recurring voice” for the need to improve staffing at Waupun.
“Unfortunately, his voice was not heard,” the memorandum stated. 
“Many pieces to this puzzle” have not yet gone through the criminal justice system, Schmidt said, since cases are still being processed through the courts. 
One former Waupun employee pleaded no contest in September and was fined $250. Charges were dismissed against another, and other cases are pending, the Associated Press reported.
The Wisconsin Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Hepp’s conviction on Tuesday afternoon.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)A statement that denies the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is compiling an autism registry, but says instead that it is creating a sweeping database of existing health records, has done little to quell fears among autism advocates.
Last week, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya announced that his office would draw on an unprecedented array of public and private records to establish a “disease registry” centralizing information on autistic people’s prescription drug use, insurance claims, Medicare and Medicaid records, genetic and lab tests and even data from smartwatches.
In response to the strong pushback that followed, the department attempted to walk back the announcement — and blame the media for the furor.
“The original narrative incorrectly suggested that HHS was creating an autism registry to track individuals using personal data,” the department said in a statement to The 74. “This is not accurate. The NIH is developing a secure data repository that will allow researchers to analyze large-scale, de-identified data. The director did not misspeak; rather, the term ‘registry’ was misused by the media, implying an unethical method of data collection.”
However, using video of the NIH announcement, the fact-checking site Snopes was able to establish that the original reporting was accurate.
Bhattacharya’s initiative followed a promise by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that by September, new research sponsored by his department would identify an environmental toxin responsible for what he called an autism epidemic. That theory contradicts mainstream science that links autism to genes and the increasing number of diagnoses to better testing — particularly in low-income households and among children of color.
Though many autistic children are able to prepare for college and a career when given the proper supports, “These are kids who will never pay taxes,” Kennedy said. “They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”
To head the study, Kennedy appointed a man cited by Maryland officials for practicing medicine without a license. David Geier was also found to have improperly prescribed puberty blockers for autistic children and administered a harmful drug used to treat lead poisoning that is not approved for use in the U.S.
Given Kennedy’s public proclamations, advocates said they would take a wait-and-see stance to the announcement that the new database would not contain a registry.
“This is positive news, but given this administration’s previous actions and comments, particularly those related to autism over the last several weeks, we are not assuming that there is no longer anything to worry about,” leaders of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network said in a statement. “Given everything this administration is saying and doing about autism, privacy and public health, we have every reason to distrust this initiative under current leadership at HHS.”

The word “registry” is particularly polarizing to disability advocates, who note that such lists — which still exist in some U.S. states — were used to identify autistic children who were killed in Nazi Germany’s experimental “euthanasia clinics,” as well as people to be sterilized and institutionalized in the United States.
“ ‘Registry’ and ‘data collection’ can mean many things,” the network said, adding that if advocates had been included in discussions about the proposed research, they could have asked for clarity: “Under previous administrations led by both Democrats and Republicans, we and other organizations had direct lines of communication with autism policy experts inside HHS.”
Several days before the NIH announcement was reported, four dozen organizations that advocate for autistic people issued a rare collective statement criticizing Kennedy’s repeated, disproven claims about a condition many scientists agree is a naturally occurring neurotype.
“We are deeply concerned by growing public rhetoric and policy decisions,” said the letter. “Claims that autism is ‘preventable’ [are] not supported by scientific consensus and perpetuate stigma. Language framing autism as a ‘chronic disease,’ a ‘childhood disease’ or ‘epidemic’ distorts public understanding and undermines respect for autistic people.”

Proposal to Create Federal Autism Registry Stokes Fear in Disability Advocates

 




Unknown is whether the NIH plan will indeed merge records that contain sensitive personal details with datasets that don’t include people’s identifying information. “HHS will … spend tens of millions of dollars linking existing federal databases,” the trade publication Behavioral Health Business reported, attributing the information to a department statement. “The National Institutes of Health (NIH) working to partner with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies to create ‘a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy.’ ”
In its statement to The 74, the department said the dataset being assembled “would be fully compliant with these laws and regulations to protect Americans’ sensitive health information.”
“Data science can advance our understanding of biomedical and behavioral phenomena and contribute to breakthroughs that improve health by mining large sources of data, such as databases and datasets, for information,” said the statement. “Researchers can use techniques like machine learning and AI in data science to help analyze data and make predictions about health outcomes and disease incidence.”
As of press time, more than 150 researchers belonging to the recently formed Coalition of Autism Scientists had signed a letter calling on HHS and NIH to observe rigorous standards. Kennedy’s controversial dismissal of mainstream beliefs that better diagnosis is a major factor behind the rise in autism rates, and his plans to find, within a few months, an environmental toxin that causes autism, have caused mistrust, they wrote.
“We were deeply troubled to hear [Kennedy] dismiss past research, downplay the causal role of genes and portray autistic people in ways that counter our experiences and demean their value to society,” the letter says.
Among other measures, researchers urged Kennedy to pre-register the protocol for any planned study. This voluntary practice — creating a time-stamped, public document outlining what the study will attempt to determine — is intended to counter what is sometimes referred to as “hypothesizing after results are known.” The scholars also want HHS’ researchers to share their data with independent analysts for verification.

To California Democratic state Sen. David Cortese, the idea of gaining Republican support for a bill to provide cash to certain residents would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.
But his proposed legislation to offer $1,000 per month to homeless youth has so far received bipartisan support in the state Senate.
“It’s being embraced,” said Cortese. “This was not even considered possible five years ago.”
Cortese is among more than 20 Democratic lawmakers from 17 states launching Legislators for a Guaranteed Income on Tuesday to advocate for programs that provide direct, regular cash payments to lower-income residents to help alleviate poverty. They join a network of more than 245 mayors and county officials who have pursued dozens of basic income pilot projects across the country.
The list includes Colorado officials: former Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, Boulder Mayor Aaron Brockett, Northglenn Mayor Meredith Leighty, former Grand Junction Mayor Anna Stout and former Erie Mayor Justin Brooks.

The LGI lawmakers want to see states play a larger role in guaranteed income programs, which aim to help residents in need by handing out no-strings-attached cash.
The concept of basic income programs took off following a 2019 experiment in Stockton, California. There, 125 individuals received $500 per month for two years, which researchers found improved their financial stability and health.
Michael Tubbs, the former Democratic mayor of Stockton and current executive chairman of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, said these kinds of efforts are more important now as economic uncertainty and high prices squeeze the most vulnerable people.
“The work around guaranteed income is moving from cities and counties to states,” he said. “We’re going to be organizing state officials across the country who see what we all see: that affordability is an issue, that the Trump tariffs and gross mismanagement of the economy has made the problem even worse.”
While the concept has gained traction across the country, Republican state lawmakers have pushed bills to ban basic income programs, arguing they disincentivize work.
Last year, then-state Sen. John Wiik sponsored successful legislation banning South Dakota localities from launching basic income programs. At the time, the Republican said he was worried about people growing dependent upon the government.
“So, if you get people addicted to just getting a check from the government, it’s going to be really hard to take that away,” he told Stateline.
The Denver Basic Income Project, which started in 2020, was the first and largest organization in the country to study the impact of direct cash assistance on people experiencing homelessness. It distributed more than $10.5 million to recipients, but Denver leaders withdrew support from the project last year after they said an analysis of the project “did not show a statistically significant difference in homelessness resolution between the groups that received large cash transfers and those who did not.”
Legislators for a Guaranteed Income says its 23 members have so far introduced 25 bills across 11 states.

Those include Cortese’s proposed legislation in California to create a new program to help homeless youth transition out of high school.
Eligible students would receive four monthly payments of $1,000 each beginning in May. That bill, expected to cost $40 million to $50 million, has passed through two state Senate committees.
Cortese previously advocated for a 2023 California program that was the nation’s first state-funded pilot of a basic income program targeting former foster youth. He pointed to research showing basic income programs supplement, rather than replace, the need for work. And he said growing these programs can eventually reduce costs for other social safety net programs.
“I’m so pleased to see the proliferation that we’ve seen so far,” he said. “I think that it will become ubiquitous as a way of doing things and that’s going to outlast me and my career.”
In Pennsylvania, Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta said he’s still exploring details on legislation for a basic income program there.
He said pilot projects across the country have proven that people pay rent, buy groceries and invest in small businesses when they have more financial freedom.
“So, this isn’t really some big experiment,” he said. “It is a proven way to reduce poverty, improve health care, boost our local economies and really get a real return on that investment.”
Kenyatta said so-called trickle-down policies that aim to boost business interests and high earners have failed many ordinary people.
“But basic income really flips that equation on its head,” he said. “It’s not about charity. It’s about power, and about giving people the power and the resources to breathe.”

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson | Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.











I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

This is especially timely in North Carolina, since there are two bills (Senate Bill 714 and House Bill 983) in the legislature aimed at deleting the current statute that allows and provides immunity for public school personnel who “intentionally inflict pain upon the body of a student as a form of punishment” up to the point that “a student requires care beyond first aid”. (Yes, that’s right, this grisly statute is still in place and yes, this is the twenty-first century.) 
Despite no organized opposition, neither bill is likely to get even a hearing in the legislature. If you’d like the back story, please read on.
Virtually all developed countries (and a host of developing countries) prohibit the use of corporal punishment in the public schools. An exception is the United States, which leaves the issue to the states. Currently, 33 states have statutes prohibiting the practice. You already know that North Carolina, along with the entire south, still sanctions violence against public school students.
Happily, there is a Tar Heel State anomaly: Taking advantage of permission granted by the state, all 115 local school districts prohibit the use of corporal punishment, and no student has been subject to the practice since 2018! This is essentially because more than 80 studies confirm that corporal punishment does not improve academic outcomes, but IS associated with negative effects on student educational and psychological development.
Given this situation, the logical question is why is the state legislature reluctant to even consider honoring local decision-making by prohibiting corporal punishment by statute? The reason is embedded in the legislative process. While surveys of legislators indicate overwhelming support for prohibiting the practice, the process allows just a few legislators to block any bill. 
For example, the House and Senate Rules Committees, through which all bills must go, each has hundreds of bills waiting for a hearing. By rule, a bill must pass at least one chamber by the self-imposed deadline of May 8. This means most bills will die on that day, simply because the committee chair refused to give a bill a hearing. This will almost certainly be the case with the corporal punishment bills.
It is generally thought that laws reflect the norms of a society. With regard to corporal punishment in the public schools of North Carolina, this is clearly not the case. It is comforting that all local school boards and administrations have taken steps to protect students. It is disconcerting, however, that the state legislature continues to tarnish our reputation by declining to remove a statute that no longer reflects who we are.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/American-History-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-04-30 06:06:12.368474

(Mike Hawkins for KFF Health News)Adelaide Tovar, a University of Michigan scientist who researches genes related to diabetes, used to feel like an impostor in a laboratory. Tovar, 32, grew up poor and was the first in her family to graduate from high school. During her first year in college, she realized she didn’t know how to study.
But after years of studying biology and genetics, Tovar finally got proof that she belonged. Last fall, the National Institutes of Health awarded her a prestigious grant. It would fund her research and put her on track to be a university professor and eventually launch a laboratory of her own.
“I felt like receiving the award was a form of acceptance, like I had finally made it,” Tovar said. “But I think many of us now fear that this is going to poison the rest of our careers.”
Tovar is one of nearly 200 young scientists across the nation whose research and job prospects have been jeopardized by the sudden termination of the NIH’s MOSAIC grant program, one of many ended by sweeping cuts across the federal scientific agencies. The grant was created by the first Trump administration to foster a new generation of diverse scientists in biomedical research, then defunded in the second Trump administration’s ongoing purge of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.
In interviews with KFF Health News, Tovar and three other grant recipients worried that the loss of funding — coupled with President Donald Trump’s crusade against diversity programs — may transform a grant that was supposed to jump-start their careers into a blemish on their résumés that could cost them the jobs and funding that make their research possible.
“We might end up blacklisted by the NIH because of having this award — for who we are,” said Erica Rodriguez, 35, a grant recipient at Columbia University who conducts brain research that could lead to a better understanding of psychiatric disorders.
“Because not only is it for people with diverse backgrounds,” she said, “but it’s for people who advocate for other people with diverse backgrounds.”

The MOSAIC program — short for “Maximizing Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers” — was created in 2019 to provide early-career support to promising scientists from “underrepresented backgrounds” with a long-term goal to “enhance diversity in the biomedical research workforce,” according to NIH grant documents.
The five-year grant was awarded to scientists who have finished their doctorates and work in research laboratories at universities across the country. In the first two years, scientists generally receive $100,000 to $150,000, which is largely used to pay their salaries.
By the third year, the scientists are expected to have been hired as a professor, likely at a different university, where the grant funding helps them launch their own research lab. In the final three years of the grant, funding increases to about $250,000 a year, which is used to buy supplies and hire other young scientists to work in the lab, completing the cycle.
MOSAIC awardees were chosen using a broad definition of diversity beyond race, gender, and disability. It includes those who grew up in poor households or rural areas or were raised by parents who do not have college degrees. Many of those chosen for the grant also have a history of supporting other budding scientists from underrepresented backgrounds.
MOSAIC funds research on cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, spinal cord injuries, cochlear implants, fentanyl overdoses, stroke recovery, neurodevelopmental disorders, and more.
But in recent weeks the NIH has notified most MOSAIC recipients that the program was “terminated” and their funding will end by this summer, regardless of the years left on their grant, according to NIH emails reviewed by KFF Health News. Other awardees have received no official notification and only learned through word of mouth that their funding was canceled.
Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed in an email statement to KFF Health News that MOSAIC had been defunded. She said the grants “no longer align” with agency priorities or the president’s executive orders “eliminating wasteful, ideologically driven DEI initiatives.”
Trump signed one of those orders on his first day back in the White House, instructing the entire federal government to end programs that promoted diversity, referring to them as “shameful,” “immoral,” and an “immense public waste.”
Diversity programs have been slashed across the government, including at the NIH and other HHS agencies, which have canceled hundreds of grants worth billions of dollars since March. On April 21, the NIH issued a notice that banned recipients from receiving grants if they have DEI programs and said the agency could “recover all funds” from those that do not comply.
“At HHS, we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science – not one driven by political ideology,” Rodriguez Feliciano said. “We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again.”
Many MOSAIC scientists are focused on chronic diseases. Tovar, for example, researches specific genes that make people more susceptible to diabetes, which affects about 38 million Americans.
“We have a lot of treatments for diabetes that are great for the people that they work for,” Tovar said. “In my research, I use genetics to help find better drug targets so we can find medicines for people who don’t already have therapies that work.”
In interviews, Tovar and the other MOSAIC recipients described how the sudden loss of funding will throw research and careers into upheaval: Some postdoctoral researchers may lose their current jobs when funding runs dry in months; awardees competing for professor jobs will lose research funding that made them stronger candidates; and those already hired will have less money for salaries and supplies in their research labs.
Ashley Albright, 32, who grew up poor in rural North Carolina, is now a scientist at the University of California-San Francisco, where she studies Stentor coeruleus, a large single-celled organism with regenerative abilities. She plans to start applying for professor jobs this fall.
Albright said MOSAIC funding would have given her a “better shot at my dream,” which was to give other scientists from diverse backgrounds opportunities to work in her research lab.
“I feel crushed,” she said. “I feel like someone is stepping on half of my life. … I’ve spent the last 10 years in grad school and my postdoc working toward this so I can do science, but also help other people do science.”
Hannah Grunwald, 33, a grant recipient at Harvard who studies eyeless cave fish to better understand complex genetic traits, said one of her worst fears was that universities won’t hire MOSAIC awardees at a time when the White House is ordering schools to abandon DEI programs and withholding billions from those that do not bend to the Trump agenda.
“There has been an enormous debate in our community about what we should say on our résumés,” Grunwald said. “I just don’t know if having my grant canceled because it had to do with diversity is going to limit my ability to get funding in the future.”

The termination of MOSAIC drew quick condemnation from several scientific organizations that receive grant funding to work closely with the awarded scientists, with some calling it “short-sighted” and “a significant step backward.”
Mary Munson, president of the American Society for Cell Biology, who has mentored awardees since MOSAIC began, became choked up and covered her face with her hands as she considered the possibility the grant could end up holding them back.
“Taking this grant away now does not take away the fact that they won this competitive award. It doesn’t take away that they are amazing scientists,” Munson said. “I hope that institutions will still see that nonetheless.”
Stefano Bertuzzi, CEO of the American Society for Microbiology, which also mentors grant awardees, said the mass termination of MOSAIC and other NIH grants may have a cumulative effect that will stifle scientific innovation for decades.
Bertuzzi, who immigrated from Italy in the ’90s because of America’s robust funding for science, said scientists will not stay in or flock to a nation where research funding vanishes on a political whim.
“We are going to be losing a full generation of scientists,” Bertuzzi said. “Other countries in the world will thrive.”

HopSkipDrive, a national ridesharing company focused on “safety, equity and care,” is expanding its supplemental school transportation services to Virginia Beach — aiming to help students with complex needs get to class while creating new job opportunities for local drivers.
The company’s network of “CareDrivers” — highly vetted caregivers trained to provide transportation in communities with unique challenges, such as students experiencing homelessness, in foster care or with disabilities — has already been operating in Northern and Central Virginia, and other parts of the country. 
“Transportation should never be a barrier that keeps the student from accessing their education, and we’re committed to removing those obstacles,” said Cindy Hamilton, a spokeswoman for HopSkipDrive. “We’re really committed to removing those obstacles, and we’re glad to be able to do so now in Virginia Beach.”
The company also announced in February that wheelchair-accessible vehicles would become available in Northern Virginia, with plans to expand that offering to other cities nationwide for the 2025-26 school year. 
School districts typically arrange the service directly through the company. 
Shortly after HopSkipDrive’s establishment in 2019, Virginia began seeing its list of bus drivers dwindle following the pandemic. Some of the reasons for the decline include low pay and an increase in driver retirements. The company also found that many drivers contracted COVID-19 or left for jobs in the private sector.
The company surveyed schools nationally about the bus driver shortage and found little improvement. About 91% of respondents reported the shortages had constrained their school transportation operations, an increase from the 88% in 2022.
According to the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE), the rate of unfilled bus drivers has decreased to 8.7% this school year, compared to 13.6% during the 2021-22 school year.
CareDrivers has also provided opportunities for people living in and around partnership schools. Drivers include parents, grandparents, nurses and former teachers, to name a few.
“Caregivers who tell us they choose to drive with HopSkipDrive do so because of the flexibility it offers and the value of helping kids – or anyone who needs a little extra care – get where they need to go,” Hamilton said. 
She said applicants go through a “rigorous” 15-point certification process before driving on the platform and can earn income while creating their own schedules. They also must comply with existing state and local laws and regulations, as well as the platform’s safety features and community guidelines.
“We have designed our platform to be easy to use, enabling CareDrivers in Virginia Beach and across the state to provide safe, reliable rides for students, schools, and families when it works for their schedules,” Hamilton said.
In Virginia, leaders have taken additional steps to help students get to and from school. 
Last month, Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed into law a proposal carried by Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, to create a two-year pilot program allowing school divisions to explore alternative transportation options. Schools could partner with nearby colleges or private companies to help transport students.
The legislation states that vehicles must comply with state and federal safety regulations and undergo regular inspections. School boards would also be required to hold a public hearing before adopting the program and must submit an annual report detailing ridership, costs, and bus routes to the Virginia Department of Education.
Austin told the Mercury the bill offers another option for schools in rural areas to cut costs while ensuring students are transported efficiently.
Last summer, the VDOE also amended its school bus specifications to state, “smaller capacity fleet vehicles are some options that can be used in conjunction with customary methods to provide a flexible, efficient, and comprehensive public school pupil transportation solution.”

Advocates point to the truly significant revenue they can generate for local governments. Opponents point to data centers’ enormous energy needs, climate impacts, water use and their capacity to diminish the quality of life for residents living nearby.
Will special rate classes protect Va. residents from the costs of serving data centers?

To weigh the costs and benefits of data centers and to set the ground rules for any potential data-center development, local governments should empower members of the public with all relevant information to foster a meaningful debate. We fear, however, that the widespread use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and a larger ethic of secrecy regarding data-center development curtails this discussion and, in so doing, impairs local democracy.
In order to understand how common NDAs are between local governments and data center companies, we submitted Freedom of Information Act requests to every Virginia locality we could identify with an existing, approved, or proposed data center. We found that the vast majority – 25 out of a total of 31 localities – have NDAs. We think that this could be an underestimate because some local governments may use definitions or maneuvers to avoid disclosing this information. For instance, one county reported that officials signed an NDA with a major tech firm, but they did not retain a copy for public record.
When we began our research, we naively assumed that NDAs were narrowly drawn guarantees that local governments would not share a company’s proprietary technology or cutting-edge trade secrets. But upon reading the documents, we found that they were written much more broadly, to prohibit sharing all “business plans” and/or “non-public information.” Such  broad categories could cover almost anything, including information that relates directly to community impacts. 
While these agreements acknowledge that a local government may be required to disclose information if requested by the public, they also often call on officials to share as little as legally possible, while giving the data center company advanced notice to intervene with its legal team if it so wishes before any information is shared. In this way, NDAs are written to privilege secrecy over transparency in data center development.
Data centers approved, solar farms rejected: What is going on in rural Virginia?

There is, of course, another perspective on this topic. Local officials might argue that the use of non-disclosure agreements is both lawful and routine in many types of economic development, not just for data centers. Our response is that just because a practice is currently legal, it doesn’t mean that it should remain that way. And even if local governments frequently join confidentiality agreements, it doesn’t mean that they are in the interest of local democracy. 
For example, when one local government released two NDAs to us, it asked that we keep the information as confidential as possible out of fear that it could jeopardize its data-center projects that were in the works, but not yet publicly announced. Why would sharing this information put the deals in jeopardy? If they are in the public interest, the projects should be able to withstand scrutiny even as they develop.
Here in our hometown of Fredericksburg, the city council recently passed zoning changes to create a technology overlay district for a new data center campus. But it did not give the public enough information to effectively participate in the conversation beforehand. The city did not announce the name of the data center company until the night of the city council’s vote. The city did not share the total number of data centers that would be included in the project until the day after the vote. Members of the public knew that the project would include several data centers, but many people – including us – were surprised to learn that the project will include eight to 12 new data center buildings.
Depending upon the kind of cooling system that a data center uses, its operation may require huge amounts of water, as much as several million gallons a day. But confidentiality agreements may prevent the public from fully understanding potential impacts to our rivers and water systems. This is clearly evident in a water service agreement between Spotsylvania County and Amazon for a new data center campus, which includes a confidentiality clause that states, “for the avoidance of doubt ADS [Amazon Data Service] water usage, sewage usage, and basis of design is considered Confidential Information.”
Data center water and wastewater use should not be confidential. The wellbeing of our rivers, streams and aquifers impacts us all. But this is not just about protecting the health of our environment; it’s also about protecting our democracy.
Local democracy means more than elections. It also requires properly informing the public, nurturing meaningful discussions, and giving community members an opportunity to influence decisions that will directly impact them. By withholding important and timely information, local governments and data center companies short-circuit debate in order to arrive at predetermined outcomes. 
Democracy – some say – dies in the dark. But that is exactly where many data center deals are born and live.

(Photo courtesy AmeriCorps)Maryland was one of the lead states in a coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia that sued the Trump administration Tuesday in an effort to block its push to “dismantle” AmeriCorps, the domestic volunteer service agency.
The suit said that within the past two weeks, agency officials, at the direction of Elon Musk’s DOGE Service,  put 85% of the administrative staff on leave as well as all of the members of the National Civilian Conservation Corp, who were told their service would be terminated.
Last Thursday, the agency began sending reduction-in-force notices to all the administrative staffers who were on leave, the lawsuit said, and after hours on Friday it began notifying states that nearly $400 million in AmeriCorps programs operating in their states was being immediately terminated. That cut would affect more than 1,000 AmeriCorps programs nationwide, according to a statement Tuesday from Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown.
He said that in Maryland, Brown said, AmeriCorps had 4,949 members and provided more than $21 million last year in federal funding and education awards last year, supporting 4,949 members serving across the state. He said the Governor’s Commission on Service and Volunteerism funded 25 service programs through Americorps for everything from working with refugees or elderly residents to being in Teach for America.
“In Maryland alone, programs that educate children, care for the elderly, and rebuild homes are being wiped out overnight. I will fight this brazen abuse of power in court and do everything in my power to restore these life-changing services,” Brown said in a prepared statement on the filing of the lawsuit.
As Trump hits 100 days, Brown among attorneys general battling him at every turn

AmeriCorps has its roots in the Great Society programs of the 1960s and took its current form in 1993, as the Corporation for National and Community Service. It is a public-private partnership, in which volunteers typically spend a year of service, during which they are paid a stipend to cover basic living expenses and can receive scholarship funding at the end of their service.
Until the cuts began earlier this month, CNCS had a staff of 700 and supported more than 200,000 members, the lawsuit said.
The suit said the White House does not have the authority to eliminate the AmeriCorps program, which was authorized and funded by Congress and can only be undone by lawmakers. The sudden, DOGE-inspired cuts were unlawful, arbitrary and capricious, failed to provide sufficient public notice, and exceeded presidential powers to intrude on congressional authority, the suit said.
“The Administration is free to ask Congress to abolish AmeriCorps, but it cannot simply terminate the agency’s functions by fiat or defund the agency in defiance of administrative procedures, Congressional appropriations, and the Constitutional separation of powers,” the suit said. “Accordingly, the Defendants’ actions should be declared unlawful and vacated.”
Those charges were echoed in an April 23 letter to President Donald Trump, led by Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and signed by 147 other members of Congress, including both of Maryland’s senators and four of its eigth House members: Democratic Reps. Johnny Olszewski Jr., Sarah Elfreth, Kweisi Mfume and Jamie Raskin.
The cuts to the program will “prevent the agency from continuing to deliver critical services, which include supporting veterans, fighting wildfires, tutoring in schools, combatting the fentanyl epidemic, and much more,” the letter said.
That was echoed by Gov. Wes Moore (D), who said in a statement Tuesday that the state “strongly supports the litigation to be filed by Attorney General Brown today to stand up for AmeriCorps.”
“If the federal administration wants to strengthen our country’s resolve, bridge divides, and usher in our next era of greatness, it should be expanding opportunities for Americans to serve one another,” Moore’s statement said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The lawsuit is just the most recent of dozens filed by Democratic attorneys general against the Trump administration’s lightning-fast and deep cuts to federal programs and funding, many of which have been successful at reversing or stalling those cuts. Brown has joined more than two dozen such suits, on education cuts, worker firings, transgender rights and more, and this is the second on which he has been one of the lead plaintiffs.
The suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for Maryland by Brown and the attorneys general of California, Colorado and Delaware. Also joining the suit were the attorneys general of Arizona, Connecticut, the District of Colombia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, and the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/14992813330_91a8d676ef_o-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-30 05:04:43.869141

(Screenshot from presentation by John Culbertson, vice president of MSW Consultants)To get a better understanding of what’s in New Hampshire’s trash, workers hand-sorted more than 250 samples of garbage around the state and visually surveyed hundreds more.
Those findings will be detailed in a waste characterization study set to be released early next month, with a presentation Friday to the state’s Solid Waste Working Group offering a preview. John Culbertson, vice president of MSW Consultants, the Florida-based management consulting firm that completed the study, called it “a sort of Gallup poll of trash.”
The study focused on municipal solid waste — such as the trash residents bring to the curb — and construction and demolition debris. “Those are far and away the largest components of solid waste,” Culbertson said, with the two categories making up 952,699 annual tons, or around 87.5% of the state’s solid waste disposal, according to data cited in his presentation.
Combining the categories, the team found 41.5% of what was disposed of was not recyclable in New Hampshire. But the other trash included materials that were commonly targeted in recycling programs (14.6%), recyclable through special collection (11.5%), potentially recyclable (8.1%), and recyclable organics (24.3%), such as food waste.
The most common refuse found in municipal solid waste was unpackaged food waste (almost 12%), compostable paper (just under 8%), and packaged food waste (roughly 7%). 
“What I see is that a very significant amount of the material that we are throwing away in New Hampshire could be recycled or composted or otherwise better managed,” said Reagan Bissonnette, the executive director of the Northeast Resource Recovery Association, a recycling nonprofit, and a member of the working group.
Culbertson pointed out that recyclables sorted out of the waste were “highly contaminated” with liquid and grit, meaning some figures could be an “overstatement.” Like other statistical work, it comes with a margin of error. “Our results acknowledge that we just can’t ever get a perfect knowledge of what’s in your disposed waste stream,” he said, stressing the “nuance underneath just the reported, high-level numbers.”
This study didn’t deal with a major hot topic in the state’s waste policy discussions: the hundreds of thousands of tons of out-of-state waste that pour into New Hampshire landfills each year, which make up about half of what is dumped there. Nor did researchers venture beyond the state to analyze the composition of New Hampshire trash exports. Instead, it dealt with trash generated and deposited within the state’s borders. 
It offers insights into how the state can work to meet its diversion goals. New Hampshire has a statutory goal — but not a mandate — to reduce solid waste, in weight, by 25% by 2030 and 45% by 2050. These goals specifically target municipal solid waste and construction and demolition debris.
The preferred way to minimize that waste, as established in the state’s official waste management hierarchy, is to reduce it at its source. Then there’s recycling and reuse, composting, waste-to-energy, and incineration, in that order. Landfilling is the last resort. 
The state has taken some recent steps toward cutting down on food waste. In February, a law went into effect prohibiting “any person” generating one ton or more of food waste per week from disposing of that waste in a landfill or incinerating it, carving out exceptions if the person is farther than 20 miles from an alternative facility or if there isn’t ample capacity at such a facility. The state plans to use federal grant money for a food waste generator study to identify entities subject to the law. 
Food releases large amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, when dumped in landfills, something supporters of the new law hope it will address. 
However, food waste bans have often been ineffective in diverting waste from landfills and incinerators. Out of the first five states to implement one, only Massachusetts succeeded in reducing landfill waste, a paper published in Science in September found. Researchers pointed to frequent inspections, an easy-to-understand law with few exceptions, and a strong composting network as factors likely influencing the state’s success.
The waste characterization study found a significant amount of materials commonly targeted for recycling instead ending up in the state’s landfills. Bissonnette said education is key, and also pointed to the success of pay-as-you-throw programs that exist in some New Hampshire communities. Trash tonnage in Concord, for instance, has gone down by 40% since the program was implemented in 2009, according to the city. 
The reduction was “pretty much overnight,” Bissonnette said.
“It was so dramatic that city staff called around to other towns to make sure that they weren’t suddenly seeing a flood of trash coming from Concord,” Bissonnette said. “And, no, it really was that people were thinking twice before throwing something away. We saw recycling increase.”
There are opportunities to divert more construction and demolition debris, too. Major components of this waste included wood (29%) and shingles (14.4%), according to the presentation. 
In Littleton, Bissonnette’s organization worked on a pilot program with the town that allowed for items that would typically be discarded in a construction and demolition debris container to instead be set aside for others to take home and use. That included materials like clean wood, which others could take to burn or use as building materials, or things like doors and windows. 
“It was a really significant amount of material that just within, I think it was about a month-and-a-half pilot program, they were able to divert and keep out of the landfill,” Bissonnette said. “And in that case, it was getting reused instead of recycled, which is even better.”
The study was funded through Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling, or SWIFR, funds made available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Executive Council approved a $295,500 contract for the project in December 2023. 
“A lot of our neighboring states and others have had this information profile, and we felt it would be really important to use these federal funds to get our own data,” said Michael Wimsatt, director of the Department of Environmental Services’ waste management division, at the meeting. 
He added: “It’s not going to be apples-to-apples comparisons (to other states), but I think it’s really going to help us.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-29-at-1.07.18-PM-1024x506.png,,,2025-04-30 05:04:43.869141

The bill, however, includes a significant exception. House Bill 781 would allow local governments by “majority vote” to designate local government-owned property located within its jurisdiction to be used for a “continuous period of up to one year for public camping or sleeping purposes.” Local governments can renew the one-year period.
  Rep. Brian Biggs (Photo: NC General Assembly)
Rep. Brian Biggs (R-Randolph) said he sponsored the bill after leaders of local municipalities came to him looking for guidance in handling homelessness. Biggs insisted the bill doesn’t criminalize homelessness as some critics contend.
“It addresses the use of public property for camping and sleeping without prohibiting homelessness,” Biggs said. “It does create clear guidance. We need guidance.”
In addition to Biggs, HB 781 is cosponsored by GOP Reps. Neal Jackson, Jennifer Balkcom and Mike Schietzelt — who represent parts of Randolph, Moore, Henderson, and Wake counties.
Under the bill, counties or municipalities designating property for encampments must establish and maintain minimum standards and procedures designed to:

Ensure the safety and security of the designated property and the persons lodging or residing on the property.
Maintain sanitation, including, at a minimum, by providing access to clean and operable restrooms and running water.
Coordinate with the county health department to provide access to behavioral health services, which must include substance abuse and mental health treatment resources.
Prohibit illegal substance use and alcohol use on the designated property and enforce the prohibition against such use.

Several people signed up to speak against the bill. They were only given one minute each to speak.
Otto Harris, a pastor speaking on behalf of Ken Carter, bishop of the Western North Carolina Conference of the United Methodist Church, said HB 781 treads on the state’s most vulnerable citizens.
“How can we push down folks who are already down?” Carter asked. “Seems like it’s impossible, but this bill has figured it out.”
Harris said the bill will criminalize homelessness and place unhoused people in “harm’s way with potential penalties, fines, court dates, blemishes on their record.”
Chris Nobblitt, an organizer for Durham-based National Union of the Homeless, said the bill will lead to deaths if approved.

“This bill will kill the Hurricane Helene victims that have still not gotten help from  FEMA or the state,” Nobblitt said. “This bill will kill veterans that serve my country, please do not let this bill pass.”
Nobblitt compared “sanction encampments” to “concentration camps.”
“If you really wanted to help homeless people, then you would help to unlock the 27 empty homes for every homeless person. You would help us get Medicaid for every person,” Nobblitt said. “You would raise the minimum wage so we could afford the sky-high rent that the corporations in North Carolina are holding hostage.”
According to the N.C. Housing Coalition, there are 1.1 million families in North Carolina who are burdened by housing costs. The group’s annual County Profiles reported that 48% of renters and 19% of homeowners in North Carolina pay more than 30% of their income on housing. Families that spend more than 30% of income on housing are considered cost-burdened. In 2024, homelessness in North Carolina increased 19%, as the official count reached a total of 11,626 individuals experiencing homelessness.
Chris Sharp of the conservative, Texas-based Cicero Institute, spoke in support of the bill.
“This bill allows for local governments to establish sanctioned camping, camping areas that provide basic sanitation, access to mental health and substance abuse treatment, along with protection from gangs drug dealers, which often prey on these vulnerable individuals,” Sharp said. “HB 781 also provides for protection of individual property and small business property rights.”
Bill critics have said they believe Sharp’s group represents is behind HB 781.
“I’m also glad today that the Cicero Institute has finally revealed itself as the sponsor and lobbyist for this bill,” said Latonya Agard, executive director of the N.C. Coalition to End Homelessness.

Agard noted that the Cicero Institute was founded by billionaire venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale who she said has opposed Housing First policies that prioritizes getting people experiencing homelessness into permanent housing.
“They have provided the template for this bill in other states around the country as an opposition to Housing First, which is documented and clearly has evidence that it does work when it is funded properly,” Agard said. “This bill does not take into account the issue that there is not enough affordable housing as homelessness has increased, as the number of people who are unsheltered has increased, our affordable housing availability has decreased, and that is why we see so many people in this need.”

Benjamin Horton, director of outreach at Veteran Services of the Carolinas, said he’s concerned about whether municipalities can keep veterans safe in such encampments. Horton also worries about being about to find veterans to provide services if the bill becomes law.
“We’re a very stubborn bunch,” the U.S. Navy veteran said. “You’re telling us where we camp, where we can’t camp. That’s going to make it harder on street outreach folks, mental health folks who are working with the VA for multiple services.”
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) said the bill doesn’t solve the problem of homelessness. Lawmakers must address low wages, mental illness and other conditions that lead to homelessness, she said.
A person making minimum wage — $7.25 per hour — and working two, 40-hour a week jobs can’t afford to pay rent, Budd said.
“You do that for two jobs, you’re at $30,160 [a year], so when we talk about solutions for homeless people, we need to not just be talking about affordable housing,” Budd said.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
Federal education cuts and Trump DEI demands leave states, teachers in limbo

In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
‘It’s the system that needs fixing’
Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law Monday.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
Debate over holding back third graders roils state legislatures

The new law requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
Opposition to ‘science of reading’
Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.










A student's likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute


In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

Gov. Ned Lamont proposed using tens of millions of those dollars to fund social services, but in its proposed budget released last week, the Appropriations Committee said this money should come from the General Fund. Even so, some Democratic leaders say they would be open to Lamont having a role in how the settlement funds are used, a major reversal that would require changing state law.
Just a few years ago, Lamont backed a law that created the Connecticut Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee (OSAC) to designate how more than $600 million in opioid funds that are expected to come to the state over an 18-year period should be spent. The law was intended to prevent lawmakers and future governors from dipping into the money to fill budget gaps like they historically did with the tobacco settlements of the 1990s.
[RELATED: Lamont wants to dip into opioid settlement to fund social services]
Lamont’s proposed budget would require changing that law so the money could be used for things like cold weather emergency response and mobile crisis care, services that were previously funded by fees, taxes and federal funds. But in the Appropriations Committee’s proposed budget for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, legislators specified that the Opioid Settlement Fund is separate, and “expenditures must be approved by the Committee and used in accordance with the controlling judgment, consent decree, or settlement.”
Lawmakers recommended continuing these services but said that the money should come from the General Fund. In some cases, they also recommended less money for services.
In a statement through a spokesperson, Attorney General William Tong said he appreciates that the funds have been restored.
“We look forward to continuing discussions about how to fund the state’s priorities consistent with the settlement language and Connecticut’s opioid settlement statute, which requires opioid funding proposals to go through an application process,” the statement reads.
John Lally, a member of OSAC who lost his son to opioid use, said he was “really surprised” when he learned that Lamont had proposed using settlement funds. 
“It goes against what he agreed to in the beginning,” Lally said. 
Lally has spent many hours over the past two years on the committee. While he said it would be frustrating to see that time go to waste, “the bigger issue is what we owe the people of Connecticut who struggle with addiction and their families.” By going through the careful process that OSAC has set up, Lally believes, the funds will be spent “in a way that will honor them and the ones we’ve lost, like my son, in the best way we can.”
After Lally learned of Lamont’s proposal, he and other members of OSAC have been calling lawmakers for their support to ensure the funds would not be diverted.
“We’re willing to fight for what we believe is right,” he said.
But not everyone on OSAC seems to agree that the process is going well, or that Lamont should be kept out of decision-making.
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee and a member of OSAC, said that she doesn’t believe that the line items Lamont singled out to be funded by OSF were the right choice for how the money should be used, but she would be open to the governor and lawmakers weighing in on how that money is spent in the future if it’s carefully focused on opioid addiction and treatment.
“What we have going on right now is an overthought process (on OSAC), and I am well OK with thinking about things, but I think there has to be action along with thinking about things,” Osten said. 
Advocates have expressed frustration with the slow pace of OSAC’s decision-making and confusion over how recommendations for using the funds are being considered, especially considering the stakes of the opioid crisis. But in recent months, the group has picked up the pace: as of mid-April, the fund had received more than $158 million, of which about $93 million has already been allocated, according to Chris McClure, the chief of staff at the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, co-chair of the Public Health Committee and a member of OSAC, said that the committee should be in charge of making decisions about how the funds are used but agreed with Osten that there may be a middle ground that includes the committee while also allowing elected officials to have a say. 
“I think honoring the process is still worthwhile,” he said.

There are many factors that go into the overdose epidemic of opioids and other drugs that kill thousands of North Carolinians each year.
As a pair of law and medicine experts explained, however, in a recent NC Newsline op-ed, there are some increasingly successful strategies that deserve public support.
And topping the list is the urgent need for everyone – health care providers, law enforcement, elected officials – to recognize that substance use disorder – is just that: a medical disorder, not merely an addiction or personal weakness to be frowned upon.
Fortunately, polls show that an overwhelming majority of North Carolinians have come to understand this truth and strongly favor what experts describe as “a health-first approach” to the problem, that includes funding for non-judgmental, evidence-based treatment programs.
The bottom line: To his great credit, Governor Josh Stein has voiced strong support for committing the state to just such an approach and ending the stigma that too often attaches to substance use disorder. All state policymakers and providers should follow his lead.

With a final few tweaks, Ohio senators advanced a major piece of energy legislation.
The Senate Energy Committee vote was unanimous. With both chambers in session Wednesday, it’s likely lawmakers could sign off on the legislation and send it along to the governor.
The most substantive change had to do with the Public Utility Commission of Ohio clock — it moved from 320 days to 360. Lawmakers are putting a ceiling on PUCO deliberations because they want rate cases to move more quickly.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
After Tuesday’s hearing, state Sen. Bill Reineke, R-Tiffin, connected the longer shot clock to broader changes in the ratemaking process. Utilities must come before the PUCO every three years, and they’ll be able to set rates in three-year increments with annual “true-ups” to reflect the companies’ actual balance sheet. Reineke explained the longer timeline will give regulators a bit of breathing room.
Final testimony
Before lawmakers put the bill to a vote, Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis made a final bid to remove a provision on consumer refunds. Under the changes, bill payers could receive refunds after the Supreme Court determines a charge was unwarranted, but any payments prior to that decision would be out of reach.
Willis explained her office in the middle of a case against Dayton-area AES Ohio which could yield more than $300 in refunds per customer.
“If HB 15 becomes law as written AES’s half a million consumers would lose that refund opportunity that has been in the making since 2019,” she said.
Ohio senators propose changes to harmonize House, Senate energy bills

The final version of the bill also left out a passage subjecting more power line projects to state oversight. Willis called that omission “disappointing.”
“No one is reviewing these projects,” she argued. “Not the Ohio Power Siting Board, not the PUCO and not (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission). Ohio consumers, your constituents, pay 100% of those costs through transmission riders.”
Rebecca Mellino from the Nature Conservancy praised lawmakers for repealing a controversial coal subsidy approved as part of 2019’s HB 6 but argued “Ohio lags far behind neighboring states” when it comes to renewable energy. She suggested provisions encouraging brownfield redevelopment could offer an opportunity for renewable energy investment.
Bigger picture
The core incentive for new energy production is a reduction in tangible personal property taxes — levied on things like machinery and equipment. But while lawmakers attempt to boost energy production with a tax cut, they’re also trying to find reductions in property taxes.  Energy committee chairman, Sen. Brian Chavez, R-Marietta, insisted the reductions won’t undermine services.
“We’re not changing any taxes that are in effect right now,” he explained. “So any taxes from power plants that are in place will stay in place as they depreciate out — this is only on new generation.”
Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, argued the tax break is an important cue to companies. When lawmakers passed HB 6, he said, they subsidized coal and nuclear facilities.
“It was not just putting your thumb on the scale,” he said, “I mean, it wreaked havoc in natural gas generation.” With the current bill, lawmakers will remove the last of those subsidies.
“So we’ve sort of restored capitalism in the energy generation space,” Smith argued. “And by reducing the tangible personal property percentage, hopefully that sends a signal.”
Still, there’s little Ohio’s legislation can do to address lawmakers’ central concern about power demand outstripping supply. The 13-state power network PJM has a substantial backlog of power plants that want to connect to the grid, and large-scale consumers like data centers are pushing demand for power higher.
“That’s why we focused on behind the meter generation,” Chavez said, “so that any new industry that comes into Ohio is not adding additional strain on the existing grid.”
Behind the meter generation involves building a bespoke power plant directly connected to a given business.
“PJM is aware of the concerns that are out there. They’re hearing that from all 13 states,” Chavez added. “They are on our list. We’re going to go talk to them in the fall, and we’re going to have some frank conversations with them to see how we can partner to get through this.”

(Getty Images)There have been several new bills circulating in the New Hampshire Legislature regarding vaccines, among them is House Bill 679.
The bill, which passed the House in March and is now in the Senate, focuses on cutting the requirement for children to get vaccines that have not been shown to prevent transmission, or spread, of a disease. 
At first glance of this bill, one may reason: Why should they have to get a vaccine if it has not been shown to prevent disease spread? The truth is, while many immunizations do a great job at reducing spread of a disease through a population, that is not the only thing that they do. Not all vaccines prevent a person from contracting a disease. 
One of the major things vaccines do is prevent disease severity. A person who gets the influenza vaccine may still come down with the flu despite being vaccinated. However, they will be far less likely to develop severe influenza if they are vaccinated. 
In 2021, it was found that patients who were vaccinated against influenza had a 26% lower risk of ICU admission and 31% lower risk of death due to the influenza virus. Becoming vaccinated against the flu also prevents overall hospitalization rates, and in the 2019-2020 flu season, approximately 100,000 influenza-related hospitalizations were avoided due to the influenza vaccine. 
This is not only significantly beneficial for those who were vaccinated against the flu, but also for anyone else who needed a hospital bed for any reason during that flu season. Hospitals had more available space for all patients than they would have had if they were overrun by patients with influenza.
Most of the routine vaccines administered are to infants and school-aged children. This kind of legislation makes our schools less safe against preventable disease, putting students, teachers, staff, and families at risk, again not just for infection but serious infection requiring more intensive care. 
Many people are already aware of the recent measles outbreak in the U.S., which has now reached 30 states. Measles is a highly contagious virus that has been shown to manifest in 90% of close contacts of an infected patient. It typically starts with a fever as high or higher than 104 degrees, runny nose, cough, and conjunctivitis. 
After about a week, patients often develop the “classic” measles rash, which starts on the face and spreads down toward the rest of the body. In vaccinated patients, measles can be fairly mild. For unvaccinated children (i.e. school-aged children who did not get the vaccine or infants less than 1 year of age who are not yet old enough for the vaccine), measles often leads to further complications. 
The mild complications typically include ear infections and diarrhea. More severe complications include pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling in the brain), hospitalization (1 in 5 unvaccinated patients who contract measles require hospitalization), and death (1 to 3 in every 1,000 children with measles). 
Complications can often also occur in adults, and particularly in pregnant patients where they have higher rates of premature delivery and low birth weight. One complication that people generally are less familiar with is called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which occurs 7 to 10 years after a child has recovered from the measles infection, and is a fatal disease of the central nervous system.
For measles, a vaccination rate in a community needs to be at least 95% to have effective “herd immunity,” or essentially to prevent a measles outbreak. Last year (2023-2024 school year), New Hampshire kindergartners had a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination rate of 89.2%, which despite sounding like quite a lot is not nearly enough to prevent spread. The state of Maine does not allow religious or personal exemptions to vaccines for schools, and their kindergartener MMR vaccination rate during the last school year was 97.2%.
As of April 24, there have already been 884 reported cases of measles in the United States. This is compared to the 285 cases reported in all of 2024, and the zero cases reported in 2000, when measles was considered fully eradicated from the U.S.
Polio, which is generally more severe in its complications and outcomes than measles, is another disease that has been eradicated from the U.S. due to immunization. By loosening the reins on vaccine requirements, we risk reintroducing our communities to these deadly and debilitating diseases.
Bad vaccination policies put New Hampshire residents at risk. As a state, we could put our country at risk. Immunizations save lives from preventable illnesses, and by declaring exemption or reducing vaccine requirements, we are not only allowing, but encouraging, the spread of disease.

(Photo by Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”
Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky, and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
‘Generational change’ to taxes
While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
An uneven tax burden
Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco, and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

(Haines Eason)Like many, I’m grappling with the fallout from the presidential election. Life being life, the election result caps a tumultuous time for me. 
My father is dying from a three-plus-year battle with myeloma. My mother needed emergency surgery to correct a health issue that flared up due to the stress of trying to care for my father on her own. I now fly home from Lawrence to Charlottesville, Virginia, as often as I can. I’m from just outside C-Ville, as it’s dubbed locally, and I’m an only child. 
Add to all this that I’m father to two boys, 6 and 4, the oldest being autistic and also diagnosed with my ADHD. 
To stay sane, I meditate, lift weights, bike as often as I can, and try to stay off my phone.
And I used to garden.
One recent, chilly spring morning, I got a wild hair: I went looking for some ancient vegetable seeds from a dusty and cobwebbed corner of the garage. They were buried under long-unused root heating mats, dry and furry peat seed starting pucks and cups, and a menagerie of bird-feeding paraphernalia.
I brought the peat pucks outside to my boys, who were wreaking havoc in the backyard. We soaked them to prepare them for seeds while we selected several varieties of tomatoes to start. The seed packets were stamped with dates in years as far back as 2018, so we started something on the order of 30. I figured most would not germinate.
We now have 30 stubbornly healthy, 104-inch tomato starts. 
Let’s just say my family and neighbors have all been notified that they’ll not need to buy tomato plants for their gardens this year.
Why garden now?
My boys are just old enough to be told to stay out of the garden beds, and actually stay out of them. They’re self-directing more — they don’t need to be underfoot and don’t need to undo whatever chore I’m doing for their devilish entertainment. They’re (kind of) sleeping through the night. There’s now a little more room — mentally, spiritually.
There’s also a dark urgency. I’ve recently bought my family approximately a month’s worth of freeze-dried food, a 20-pound bag of rice, a few cans of propane and a 3,000-watt solar generator. 
Before I decided to detox from social media and the little bit of news that trickled to me through it, the phrase “we’re on our own” seemed to crop up frequently. In this second Trump era, that may be the truth.
Every day some new agency endures firings. The fallout? Benefits slashed, services cut, support and guidance denied.
If this country — if this society — is going to make it, we’re going to have to get off our phones and out into our yards and streets with our neighbors. This is where my tomato starts come in. Most will be given away — they’ll feed my community. Having a solar generator means at least one house on the block will be able to stay connected to weather reports and radio news.
Like every urban homesteader aiming to overdo it, we also hope to buy and raise some chickens soon.
That said, wait times at online hatcheries have been quite long this year with May or June deliveries for orders placed back in March. Missouri’s Cackle Hatchery reported customers lining up before they opened for business.
On the bright side, this means others are digging in — buying and raising chickens for eggs and meat. I hope those chicken-buyers are gardening, too. I hope they’re doing so with a mind to share the bounty.
With the way things are going, I don’t know that I’ll be able to track news of any gardening or urban-homesteading revolution. I have a sense it will be harder and harder to know what’s going on with any resistance before things get better.
All I can do is be present. My family doesn’t plan to flee to Canada or Europe. This is home. Lawrence is my town. This is where we fight.
If I helped to rekindle your spirit some, great. Here are some ideas on where you might start.
If you’re eager to come down from the clouds and find a local cause, your food bank likely needs your support. Thanks in part to Trump administration scrutiny and DOGE-related efforts, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently canceled shipments of fresh food to Kansas and Missouri pantries. There’s no clear sense of when or if deliveries will resume.
Local farms also need your support. If you’d like to source more of your food from nearby and invest in your community’s food supply chain, farm-to-table advocacy organization LocalHarvest hosts a Community Supported Agriculture page that can show you which farms in our area will sell to you directly.
If you don’t have access to a yard or other city-located greenspace, a community garden may be for you. The American Community Gardening Association hosts a Find a Garden | Share a Garden page, and there are numerous ones in Kansas.
Chicken-wise, you’ll be waiting if you want to raise them for meat or eggs. The good news is there are many quality hatcheries that will ship numerous breeds directly to you.
That said, there are scammers out there (yes, even for those just wanting to purchase baby chickens). This BackYard Chickens article offers solid advice on how to separate fraud farms from reputable operations.
Best of luck, whether you garden or raise chickens or subscribe to a CSA. I hope you find the community you need and the strength to carry on.

In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon tried to fire the Department of Justice prosecutor leading an investigation into the president’s involvement in wiretapping the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters.
Since then, the DOJ has generally been run as an impartial law enforcement agency, separated from the executive office and partisan politics.
Those guardrails are now being severely tested under the Trump administration.
In February 2025, seven DOJ attorneys resigned, rather than follow orders from Attorney General Pam Bondi to dismiss corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams. Adams was indicted in September 2024, during the Biden administration, for alleged bribery and campaign finance violations.
One DOJ prosecutor, Hagan Scotten, wrote in his Feb. 15 resignation letter that while he held no negative views of the Trump administration, he believed the dismissal request violated DOJ’s ethical standards.
Among more than a dozen DOJ attorneys who have recently been terminated, the DOJ fired Erez Reuveni, acting deputy chief of the department’s Office of Immigration Litigation, on April 15. Reuveni lost his job for speaking honestly to the court about the facts of an immigration case, instead of following political directives from Bondi and other superiors.
Reuveni was terminated for acknowledging in court on April 14 that the Department of Homeland Security had made an “administrative error” in deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, against court orders. DOJ leadership placed Reuveni on leave the very next day.
Bondi defended the decision, arguing that Reuveni had failed to “vigorously advocate” for the administration’s position.
I’m a legal ethics scholar, and I know that as more DOJ lawyers face choices between following political directives and upholding their profession’s ethical standards, they confront a critical question: To whom do they ultimately owe their loyalty?
Identifying the real client
All attorneys have core ethical obligations, including loyalty to clients, confidentiality and honesty to the courts. DOJ lawyers have additional professional obligations: They have a duty to seek justice, rather than merely win cases, as well as to protect constitutional rights even when inconvenient.
DOJ attorneys typically answer to multiple authorities, including the attorney general. But their highest loyalty belongs to the U.S. Constitution and justice itself.
The Supreme Court established in a 1935 case that DOJ attorneys have a special mission to ensure that “justice shall be done.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXDOJ attorneys reinforce their commitment to this mission by taking an oath to uphold the Constitution when they join the department. They also have training programs, internal guidelines and a long-standing institutional culture that emphasizes their unique responsibility to pursue justice, rather than simply win cases.
This creates a professional identity that goes beyond simply carrying out the wishes of political appointees.
Playing by stricter rules
All lawyers also follow special professional rules in order to receive and maintain a license to practice law. These professional rules are established by state bar associations and supreme courts as part of the state-based licensing system for attorneys.
But the more than 10,000 attorneys at the DOJ face even tougher standards.
The McDade Amendment, passed in 1998, requires federal government lawyers to follow both the ethics rules of the state where they are licensed to practice and federal regulations. This includes rules that prohibit DOJ attorneys from participating in cases where they have personal or political relationships with involved parties, for example.
This law also explicitly subjects federal prosecutors to state bar discipline. Such discipline could range from private reprimands to suspension or even permanent disbarment, effectively ending an attorney’s legal career.
This means DOJ lawyers might have to refuse a supervisor’s orders if those directives would violate professional conduct standards – even at the risk of their jobs.
This is what Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon wrote in a Feb. 12, 2025, letter to Bondi, explaining why she could not drop the charges against Adams. Sassoon instead resigned from her position at the DOJ.
“Because the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged, I cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations … because I do not see any good-faith basis for the proposed position, I cannot make such arguments consistent with my duty of candor,” Sassoon wrote.
As DOJ’s own guidance states, attorneys “must satisfy themselves that their behavior comports with the applicable rules of professional conduct” regardless of what their bosses say.
Post-Watergate principles under pressure
The president nominates the attorney general, who must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
That can create the perception and even the reality that the attorney general is indebted to, and loyal to, the president. To counter that, Attorney General Griffin Bell, in 1978, spelled out three principles established after Watergate to maintain a deliberate separation between the White House and the Justice Department.
First, Bell called for procedures to prevent personal or partisan interests from influencing legal judgments.
Second, Bell said that public confidence in the department’s objectivity is essential to democracy, with DOJ serving as the “acknowledged guardian and keeper of the law.”
Third, these principles ultimately depend on DOJ lawyers committed to good judgment and integrity, even under intense political pressure. These principles apply to all employees throughout the department – including the attorney general.
Recent ethics tests
These principles face a stark test in the current political climate.
The March 2025 firing of Elizabeth Oyer, a career pardon attorney with the Justice Department, raises questions about the boundaries between political directives and professional obligations.
Oyer was fired by Bondi shortly after declining to recommend the restoration of gun rights to actor Mel Gibson, a known Donald Trump supporter. Gibson lost his gun rights after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor domestic battery charge in 2011.
Oyer initially expressed concern to her superiors about restoring Gibson’s gun rights without a sufficient background investigation, particularly given Gibson’s history of domestic violence.
When Oyer later agreed to testify before Congress in a hearing about the White House’s handling of the Justice Department, the administration initially planned to send armed U.S. Marshals officers to deliver a warning letter to her home, saying that she could not disclose records about firearms rights to lawmakers.
Oyer was away from home when she received an urgent alert that the marshals were en route to her home, where her teenage child was alone. Oyer’s attorney described this plan as “both unprecedented and completely inappropriate.”
Officials called off the marshals only after Oyer confirmed receipt of the letter via email.
Why independence matters
In my research, I found that lawyers sometimes have lapses in judgment because of the “partisan kinship,” conscious or not, they develop with clients. This partisan kinship can lead attorneys to overlook serious red flags that outsiders would easily spot.
When lawyers become too politically aligned with clients – or their superiors – their judgment suffers. They miss ethical problems and legal flaws that would otherwise be obvious. Professional distance allows attorneys to provide the highest quality legal counsel, even if that means saying “no” to powerful people.
That’s why DOJ attorneys sometimes make decisions that frustrate political objectives. When they refuse to target political opponents, when they won’t let allies off easily, or when they disclose information their superiors wanted hidden, they’re not being insubordinate.
They’re fulfilling their highest ethical duties to the Constitution and rule of law.

(Stock photo from Getty Images.)Ohio University will close the Pride Center, the Women’s Center and the Multicultural Center in response to a new higher education law banning diversity efforts that takes effect this summer, the university president announced Tuesday. 
OU will sunset the Division of Diversity and Inclusion — which includes those three centers — “over the next several weeks,” Ohio University President Lori Stewart Gonzalez said in a statement.

There is no definitive date for when the division or the centers will close, but the centers will not be open beyond when the law takes effect on June 23, according to university spokesperson Dan Pittman. 
“Work managed by the division that remains within the law will be moved to other areas of the university,” the university said. 
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced Senate Bill 1 at the end of January, it quickly passed both chambers and Gov. Mike DeWine signed it into law on March 28. Youngstown State University faculty are trying to get a referendum on the November ballot to block S.B. 1. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
The new law will also prohibit faculty strikes, regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things.  
“We must continue to ensure every person we invite to be a part of our university community finds their place here and develops connections,” Gonzalez said in her letter to the university. “Without forgetting that essential commitment, we must also follow the law.”
All employee positions within the Division of Diversity and Inclusion will be eliminated. The three centers have eight full-time staffers, according to their websites. The centers also have student workers. 
“Employees will continue in their current roles for the next several weeks and will be given the opportunity to interview for any open university position for which they apply and meet minimum qualifications,” Gonzalez said. 
Employees who don’t continue to work at OU will receive full separation benefits, according to the university. 
Support for the university’s Templeton, Urban, Appalachian, and Margaret Boyd Scholars programs will move under the Honors Tutorial College. 
Ohio University’s Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine’s Office of Inclusion will also close because of the new law. 
The university said it will be reaching out to students, faculty and staff for their input on inclusion and belonging moving forward. 
“I want to be clear that the task ahead for all of us is not to look for ways to recreate the same approaches under a different name,” Gonzalez said. “Rather, the charge is to invent something new that meets the moment and delivers results for our students.”
The Capital Journal previously reported on how OU student Audrey Ansel has been preparing for Ohio University’s Pride Center to likely close as a result of the law. 
This comes as Ohio’s public universities are in the midst of figuring out how the controversial law affects them. The University of Toledo recently announced they are suspending nine undergraduate programs in response to S.B. 1.

Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”














It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state.

Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXHe said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

(Rebecca S. Gratz for Nebraska Examiner)For 35 years, the Women’s Fund of Omaha has worked on issues foundational to achieving gender equity. We advocate for public policies that ensure all women and girls can reach their full potential. Our expertise in policy advocacy includes helping to pass legislation that supports survivors of sexual violence, provides pathways to economic security and creates solutions to problems set up by systems that were never meant for us. 
Unfortunately, very few bills prioritized and championed by legislators this session support women, especially ones like Legislative Bill 89 that claim in name but fail to make any real positive impact in our lives. This so-called “Stand With Women Act” would, if it becomes law, let politicians decide who is “male” and “female” and ban a very small number transgender people from certain bathrooms and sports teams. 
Help women’s lives
While some members of the Legislature spend a lot of time saying they “stand with women” and want to “protect women,” they fail to pass policies that provide us with paid leave when we are sick or caring for our young children and aging parents. They refuse to center our right to bodily autonomy and continue to restrict access to reproductive health care, inserting themselves into our most personal decisions and stripping us of our privacy. 
They attempt to overturn our vote to raise the minimum wage, which impacts our ability to pay rent or put food on our tables. They use the weight of the government to tell us what it means to be a woman, while we’ve been living our lives all these years experiencing the ramifications of their votes.
Nebraska lawmakers could be doing so much more to support women in our state and create meaningful change in our lives. But they will fail again if they use the limited days left of this session attempting to pass legislation like LB 89 while claiming to support us. The bill will not protect us. It will not improve our lives in any measurable way. We know who perpetuates gender-based violence in our communities, and we can clearly see who and what systems are impeding our progress. 
Actions, not words
For too long, lawmakers have attempted to distract and divide our energy. The Nebraska Legislature has pretended to care about us while taking away our rights or failing to pass the policies we need to support ourselves and our families, including those we voted for directly on the ballot.
To the women of Nebraska and our allies, it’s time to remember just what and who we are fighting for: equal pay for equal work, the ability to safely raise our families, the right to decide when and if to become a parent, the privacy to make our own medical decisions, fair workplaces and communities free from violence. 
To Nebraska lawmakers: We are at a critical point in our state’s history, and in our work to protect and advance gender equity. Are you ready to pass meaningful legislation that supports all women? We are beyond ready.

(Photo courtesy Lanny Hartmann)The little-known team of 18 Maryland Department of Agriculture inspectors that typically checks equipment such as gas pumps and grocery store scales for accuracy has a new target: electric vehicle chargers.
In recent weeks, the department has begun dispatching the “weights and measures” inspectors to public EV charging stations around the state for the first time, including some inspections that were in response to customer complaints, said Alison Wilkinson, the agency’s chief of weights and measures.
It might come as a relief for EV drivers, including Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks, who said he sometimes struggles to find reliable chargers for his state-issued electric car.
“It’s become more important, obviously, as I can’t get back from someplace, because I go to three different places, and I spend an hour sitting there … And it’s not charging,” Atticks said in a recent interview.
Wilkinson said the weights and measures team won’t police chargers for their “uptime,” or how often they work for motorists, instead making sure that each charger gives an accurate accounting of the electricity it is dispensing, and charges consumers accordingly.
But if an inspector visits an inoperable charger, Wilkinson said her agency would take action, notifying the operator and requiring fixes.
“We do not oversee uptime. That does not fall under Weights and Measures authority. However, under Weights and Measures authority, it does specify that the device owner is required by Maryland law to maintain their devices in an accurate working state for the consumer,” Wilkinson said.
Already, inspectors have temporarily shut down a “handful” of EV chargers for violations, Wilkinson said, mostly for illegally charging customers by the hour, rather than by kilowatt-hour, potentially penalizing customers for slower charging.
Moore issues executive order that could delay EV sales penalties

The inspection program comes as the electric vehicle industry faces an uncertain future, with the new presidential administration reneging on support for EVs and rescinding significant funding for charging infrastructure, including the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula program, which was expected to fund dozens of chargers along highways in Maryland.
“The industry as a whole is facing strong headwinds coming out of Washington, D.C., so it does pose a question for a state like Maryland that has bold EV goals,” said Josh Cohen, head of policy for SWTCH charging company. “Is now the time to impose unwieldy regulations on chargers while the industry is still just getting off the ground?”
But some legislators say the problem is significant enough to warrant inspections.
Aside from Tesla chargers, which have a reputation for reliability, “the record is not tremendous,” said state Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County). That frustrates existing EV drivers and could stymie future purchases, all while the state is trying to encourage EV purchases to meet climate goals, she said.
“The last thing we want is for people who have made the investment in an EV to throw up their hands and go back to a gas guzzler,” Hettleman said.
She introduced Senate Bill 913, that would have codified the Agriculture Department’s authority to inspect EV chargers and called on it to develop and enforce new reliability requirements for chargers, which would have to be operational about 97% of the time. The bill failed, in part because it had a high cost of implementation during an incredibly tight year for the state budget.
But the Agriculture Department determined that it could begin inspections without a new law, using its existing authority over weights and measures. That’s because the department follows a national weights and measures policy — the National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 44 — that has already been updated to include assessments for EV chargers.
Lanny Hartmann, a Maryland EV driver and blogger focused on charging, participated in a survey of charging infrastructure around the state in late 2024 and early 2025. It found that about half of the state’s chargers were owned by electric vehicle manufacturers Tesla and Rivian, and those ports were 99% operational.
But the remaining chargers were inoperable 31% of the time, Hartmann said in testimony on Hettleman’s bill. He said many of those chargers are funded by public dollars, or were installed by electric utilities using ratepayer funds, under a program run by the Maryland Public Service Commission that is currently under evaluation.
But Hartmann said he is “not convinced that the solution is to appoint the government as the EV charging station police.” He worries that if the state places new inspection costs on charging companies, that cost would be passed onto consumers.

“Every penny that the price goes up … adds up, and there’s already been a disturbing trend of the price of public charging creeping up,” Hartmann said.
The Agriculture Department in January began registering service technicians, who install, repair and calibrate EV chargers. The registration fee is $200 per agency, $50 per technician and an additional $25 for a required test.
The department will begin requiring registrations for every consumer-facing charging device next, Wilkinson said, with regulations being drafted now that could take effect this fall or winter. She said costs of the program will be covered by annual registration fees, which haven’t been determined yet. The cost per device will depend on “the amount of time and effort that would be put into it,” the number of workers needed and the overall cost of equipment for the program, Wilkinson said.
In order to conduct the inspections, the department still needs to purchase large testing equipment known as a standard. Each machine costs more than $100,000, and the department will also need vehicles to transport them, and training for staff, Wilkinson said.
She said the department will likely need two or three more staff members to handle the EV charger inspections. The state will be aiming to visit all Maryland chargers every few years.
Inspecting EV chargers could present challenges that inspecting gas pumps don’t, Wilkinson said. Unlike gas stations, some EV charging stations are inside parking garages, meaning inspectors might have to pay just to access them.
Then, they will need to pay for the power at each station — at a gas station, inspectors can just return any fuel they pump without incurring a charge, Wilkinson said.
And slower EV chargers might be in use for hours at a time, increasing the chances that inspectors would have to leave and return later for testing.
“We have a pretty good idea how we’re going to move forward, but there will still be some hurdles to address along the way, just as there is with any new emerging technology,” Wilkinson said.
Cohen, of SWTCH, said his company supports the meter accuracy rules, but that states must enforce those rules thoughtfully, or risk placing onerous requirements on a nascent industry. He added that he hasn’t seen much evidence that there are wide-scale problems with electric meter inaccuracy on chargers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“You could potentially have chargers being tagged by a field inspector as being out of service, just based on some network glitch that is able to be remotely fixed, and then require a field inspector to go back out again to retest it,” Cohen said. “It’s all needless delays and downtime for chargers that drivers are trying to charge at.”
In mid-April, Hartmann said he found a charger in Columbia blocked off by signs stating it had been “condemned” by the Agriculture Department. This week, the charger was still closed.
When it comes to EV charger reliability, Cohen said he sees a need for “more carrots and less sticks.” He thinks that charger manufacturers have an intrinsic motivation to keep their chargers running, and compete with titans like Tesla.
“I understand that legislators are responding to constituent frustration about some chargers that don’t provide the experience that we want them to,” Cohen said. “The industry itself is evolving, and competing to improve its products and services and address those concerns.”
State legislators said they plan to return to the drawing board next year — and they have a plan for trimming the bill’s fiscal note.
This year’s bill called for a website that would publish chargers’ functionality in real time, which added a $2 million cost to the bill’s fiscal note. Hettleman said that database was “aspirational,” and may not be included when the bill is revived for the next legislative session.
Del. Nick Allen (D- Baltimore County), who sponsored a companion bill to Hettleman’s in the House, said he’s optimistic that an amended bill would pass next session, particularly given the importance of EV adoption for the state’s climate goals.
“Right now, it’s kind of a Wild West,” Allen said. “If we want to reach our goals of so many zero-emission vehicles being sold in Maryland — if we want to reach all these ambitious climate and emissions related goals, we need to make sure that when people pull off to charge their EV they have the same confidence that they do pulling into a gas station.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54484999862_1c4a1bd3c9_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 03:59:39.449697

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The good news is that the state’s schools are not going to lose $418 million in federal funding they feared was lost last month when federal officials abruptly announced they were clawing back unspent pandemic recovery funds.
The bad news is that the state could still be out $232.1 million, the Maryland Board of Education was told Tuesday.
The confusion came after school officials received a letter last month from the U.S. Department of Education, informing states that the Trump administration would cancel Biden administration extensions that would have given schools until next year to spend down any remaining COVID-19 recovery funds.
That letter, from U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon, came in an email on Friday, March 28, at 5 p.m., which said the cancellation would take effect immediately. It said the federal department would consider reimbursing states, but only under narrow provisions.
“This took us off guard, needless to say at five o’clock on a Friday,” said Maryland State Superintendent Carey Wright. In the confusion, state officials estimated that as much as $418 million could be at stake for state schools.
Now, they say, the number is closer to $232.1 million.
Krishna Tullar, deputy state superintendent for the department’s Office of Finance and Operations, summarized from a chart that more than half of that amount, $144.9 million, comes from the third, and final, iteration of the American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief, or ARP ESSER, program.

The remaining $87.2 million came from earlier versions of ESSER and from other pandemic-response funds. It was slated for uses such as mental health services, professional development for teachers and for students experiencing homelessness, like residing in transitional housing.
Donna Gunning, assistant superintendent in the department’s division of financial planning, operations and strategy, said the federal government has not reimbursed the state for at least $127.5 million that has already been allocated. Another $104.6 million is money not reimbursed to the state’s local school systems.
Gunning said about $56.7 million of the school system money has been designated as “encumbered” and not spent by the school systems also called local education agencies, also known as LEAs.
Board President Joshua Michael summarized how local school districts will be affected if they are not reimbursed by the federal government for the millions they have spent.
“That could mean salaries for 2,000 teachers next year. It could mean 12,000 students in our pre-K program. We will have to come up with this money,” he said. “These are real dollars.”
Without schools being reimbursed, certain projects or educational programs must immediately stop. Board Vice President Monica Goldson said many local school systems “were counting on receiving that reimbursement in their FY ’26 budget.”
“And now they’ve been informed that they’re not. Then those cuts at the local level could be even more extreme than they are right now,” said Goldson, former CEO of Prince George’s County public schools. “I just want everybody to understand that we are falling off of the cliff quickly.”
Gunning said the state asked the federal department to reconsider its funding, but the only response received so far is that the reimbursement request for ESSER funding had to be resubmitted in another format.
Board member Rachel McCusker asked if there’s any indication when federal officials will inform the state of a decision.
“We are not aware of any state having received an approval since this decision,” Tullar said.
Because of the federal government’s decision, Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) joined other attorneys general in a lawsuit earlier this month against the federal agency to prevent it from arbitrarily changing its position so the states can continue to access the money that “provides essential support” for students.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Krishna-Tullar-4-29-2025-1024x774.jpg,,,2025-04-30 03:59:39.449697

(Photo by Jacques Julien via Getty Images)A task force is offering Maryland schools statewide guidelines on student cell phone use during school hours, but is being careful to say local systems should have the flexibility to adopt policies to their own circumstances.
Those were among the recommendations from the Task Force on Cell Phone Use in Schools, whose report was discussed Tuesday by the Maryland State Board of Education. The report suggests broad parameters — saying, for example, that restrictions should be most-stringent in lower grades, becoming more liberal as students age — but leaves the details to the state’s 24 school systems.
“So, our task force really wanted to create a guidance document and not a requirement that districts adopt certain aspects of a policy,” said Hannah Oakley, deputy director of the board and one of two facilitators on the task force. “We wanted to empower our districts to create these policies and not [create] a statewide mandate.”
At the beginning of the 2024-25 school year, school systems in the state had a range of cell phone policies, the one constant being that cell phones should be turned off during instructional time.
Cell phone use drew the attention of state lawmakers, who introduced a total of six separate bills on the topic during  this year’s General Assembly session, all of which would have required local school systems to have a cell phone policy in place.

All but one of the bills died in committee. The bill sponsored by Sen. Joanne C. Benson (D-Prince George’s) — which would have required the state Department of Education to develop guidelines for a policy “on student electronic devices during school hours” — made it to the House, which sent it back to the Senate with amendments on the last day of the legislative session, when time ran out on it.
The 17-member task force comprised of state officials, school superintendents, principals, teachers, parents and students did suggest a few requirements.
One would be for school districts to adopt a telehealth exception on cell phone use by middle and high school students with medical reasons that might require a phone, such as monitoring diabetes, or for those who have sensory or mental health needs. It recommended that those policies be in place in time for the 2025-26 school year.
In terms of student discipline, the task force said schools could follow a plan similar to one implemented in Montgomery County, which takes a graduated approach to responding to phone infractions.
The report also recommends school leaders could implement “phone-free initiatives,” incorporating a schoolwide campaign, for instance, for students to earn incentives by voluntarily turning off their phones and allowing school staff to put them away.
Cell phones as defined in the report would also include personal smart watches, headphones, laptops and tablets.
School board President Joshua Michael said he’s seeing young people wear Beats headphones “everywhere I go.”
The board took no action on the report Tuesday after a brief discussion. For the next step, Michael said the plan is for the board to turn any key recommendations into a resolution “that affirms the work of this report that we may consider as a board before moving into next school year.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2070585229-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 03:59:39.449697

Surprisingly, the most dynamic ecosystems aren’t always in Maryland or Northern Virginia but in fast-growing cities like Augusta, Georgia, and San Antonio and Austin, Texas.
In visiting these places, it is with an eye toward bringing best practices back to Maryland to accelerate our growth in a competitive national and international environment.
These cities not only have thriving commercial tech economies, but also host major federal technology centers. Augusta is home to the National Security Agency and the U.S. Army Cyber Command Center of Excellence.

It’s no coincidence that Texas ranks as the third-best business climate in the U.S., Georgia ranks fourth, and Maryland lags at 31st.
What sets these states apart is their commitment to policies that help technology firms grow. That’s why it’s alarming to see Maryland take the opposite approach by enacting a 3% sales tax on information technology and related services—the so-called Tech Tax.
While businesses understand the need for a balanced state budget, this tax directly undermines Maryland’s stated goal of leveraging our true strategic advantage – a world-class concentration of technology and cybersecurity firms. Maryland is home to over 3,300 federal contracting firms, with many ranging from traditional IT services to some of the most cutting-edge technologies in the world. Most operate as subcontractors to large businesses with prime contracts to the federal government. Because they provide services through another business, they will be directly impacted by the Tech Tax.
In a federal market where a 10% margin is considered strong, an additional 3% tax makes Maryland subcontractors less competitive, reducing their ability to reinvest, grow, and hire. This tax will not only stifle job creation but also drive firms to more business-friendly states.
Maryland’s technology companies don’t operate in isolation. They have options, and with the Tech Tax now law, recruiters from lower-cost, high-growth states will have an enticing pitch. Meanwhile, federal agencies, under increasing budget scrutiny, will look for lower-cost alternatives — putting Maryland firms at a clear disadvantage.
Over time, if Maryland firms consistently lose contracts due to higher costs, many will relocate to more dynamic states where business conditions are more favorable. This would be a devastating blow to our state’s economic future.
Gov. Wes Moore has rightly called Maryland’s technology sector a “lighthouse industry” that will guide our state’s economy forward. Yet, the Tech Tax threatens to extinguish that light, forcing federal subcontractors to move operations elsewhere.
As a longtime Marylander, I urge policymakers to reconsider the long-term consequences of these decisions. A tax that undermines our technology industry will hinder Maryland’s economic growth and cedes our competitive advantage to other states.

A new proposal to create a state infrastructure financing board could become another example.,"California’s governors and legislators have a very bad habit of enacting major programs and projects without fully exploring their downside risks.
The most spectacular example occurred in 1996, when a Republican governor, Pete Wilson, and a Democrat-controlled Legislature decided to overhaul California’s electric power industry.
The legislation was hammered out in lengthy and secret negotiations that participants dubbed the “Steve Peace death march” for the state senator who ramrodded the effort. It was enacted with only cursory public input.
As a 2003 autopsy of the ensuing disaster chronicled, “The act was hailed as a historic reform that would reward consumers with lower prices, reinvigorate California’s then-flagging economy, and provide a model for other states. Six years later, the reforms lay in ruins, overwhelmed by electricity shortages and skyrocketing prices for wholesale power. The utilities were pushed to the brink of insolvency and are only slowly regaining their financial footing. The state became the buyer of last resort, draining the general fund and committing itself to spending $42 billion more on long-term power deals that stretch over the next ten years.”
Other examples of the bad habit abound, such as beginning construction of a bullet train linking the two halves of the state with only rudimentary assumptions of its costs, ridership and other important factors — a project that limps along nearly two decades later.
Two others are the immensely costly expansion of pension benefits for public employees a couple of decades ago, which has hammered local government budgets, and big increases in unemployment insurance benefits without increasing revenues, which resulted in a $20 billion debt to the federal government that is still growing.
That brings us to Senate Bill 769, which appears superficially to be a positive effort to expand infrastructure financing but could be another example of unanticipated consequences. The measure, introduced by Sen. Anna Caballero, a Merced Democrat, would create the Golden State Infrastructure Corporation, a state-owned nonprofit company that could borrow money or issue bonds and provide financing for public or private infrastructure projects.
State Treasurer Fiona Ma is the bill’s sponsor and would appoint the corporation’s top executive, who would answer to a five-member board of elected officials and governors’ appointees.
“By partnering public and private capital, SB 769 enables critical investments in climate resilience, water systems, energy infrastructure, housing and transportation, creating jobs and future-proofing California for generations to come,” Caballero’s office contends.

 Democrat, State Senate, District 14 (Merced)



“California can’t afford to wait for Washington, or for outdated financing systems to catch up with 21st-century needs,” she said in a statement. “SB 769 is about building a resilient, modern California by creating a smarter, more flexible way to fund infrastructure that protects our communities, creates good jobs and prepares us for the challenges ahead.”
There are aspects to the proposal that should be triggering alarm bells.
There is no limit on how much debt the corporation could incur. The state would also not be liable if its financial structure collapsed. The decisions on financing private projects could be made secretly because the corporation would be exempt from some open meeting and open records laws.
The danger here is that with a potentially unlimited amount of money to be handed out with no public input, the political figures on the corporate board could be swayed to play favorites for reasons disconnected from infrastructure improvement.
We’ve seen scandals of that sort elsewhere in state government, such as in the Coastal Commission’s land use decisions and the California Public Employment Retirement System’s investments.
Without better safeguards and more sunshine, this is another scandal waiting to happen.

Getty ImagesChildhood poverty doesn’t happen by accident – it is found at the intersection of poor public policy, generational poverty, and a lack of access to essential resources. 
And while childhood poverty can’t be solved by one policy or organization alone it can be made much worse by removing one. Head Start is one of the most effective anti-poverty programs we have in the United States. Cutting it would have devastating effects on families and communities for generations to come. 
At Helping Mamas, a baby supply bank, we see every day what happens when children and families get the support they need and what happens when they don’t.
Head Start is so much more than just a preschool program. It is a family-centered program where parents receive workforce development support, health education and parenting education. Children receive quality early learning instruction closing literacy and school readiness gaps. It is a lifeline where families feel safe, loved and seen. 
Like many learning environments, Head Start Programs are often the heart of a community. Through my work with Helping Mamas I see Head Start utilizing our resources for diapers, wipes, car seats and other essential items. They became a place of safety during Hurricane Helene. They partnered with us to make sure that families in rural areas had access to essential items at their most vulnerable moments.
Head Start mobilizes the community to volunteer with children and parents. I know that when parents engage with Head Start they are getting the tools and support they need to break the cycle of generational poverty.
And I have to ask, in a time where the U.S. is consistently falling behind the world in academic achievement – particularly in math where U.S. students currently rank 28th globally – why would we cut a program that has shown to increase a child’s academic success all the way through college? 
I believe that good public policy, when paired with adequate funding, has the power to transform lives. It always has. 
And when you combine that with strong community partnerships, you’re not just supporting individual children — you’re investing in our future workforce, the long-term health of our communities, and the strength of our economy. 
Nonprofits alone cannot and should not continue to be the public safety net for our children. Overcoming educational deficits and poverty takes a combined approach of nonprofits, communities and public policy. Remove even one piece of the foundation and the structure won’t hold – collapsing along with the futures of our children.
Every dollar invested in Head Start generates up to $9 in economic returns through increased earnings, reduced reliance on public assistance and lower involvement with the criminal justice system. It also increases parental employment and reduced child maltreatment rates. 
Head Start was created as part of our country’s War on Poverty – because early childhood education, health care, and family support are not luxuries – they are necessities. Cutting Head Start doesn’t just impact our classrooms today – it threatens the future of our workforce, our economy and our country’s ability to compete on the world stage. 
So I will ask again: Can we afford the cost of cutting Head Start Programs? I don’t think so. Our children don’t think so. And if our politicians are serious about creating a better future, they shouldn’t think so either.  
This is more than a budget item, it is the future of our children and our communities. Let’s send the message that we cannot keep trying to balance a budget on the backs of our youngest most vulnerable citizens.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-30 04:01:40+00:00,CT Mirror,Don’t ban challenges to sexually explicit materials targeting minors,Brian Gedicks,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/say-no-to-authoritarian-ban-on-challenges-to-sexually-explicit-materials-targeting-minors-in-our-libraries-brian/,Two bills this session would force libraries across CT to adopt policies that restrict challenges to sexually explicit materials aimed at children.,"We have a porn problem in our culture, and it can start with exposing kids to pervasively vulgar and sexually explicit books, comic books, and graphic novels. 
Yet two bills proposed by legislators this session would force libraries across Connecticut to adopt policies that restrict challenges to sexually explicit materials aimed at children (SB1271, HB7014). Proponents claim the mantle of protecting “Huckleberry Finn” from “book banning” when they are really implementing “1984.” A closer look at the bills reveals an authoritarian attempt to intimidate parents and eliminate a transparent, locally controlled process.

Brian Gedicks
Right now, in Connecticut, no parent can remove a book from the library. According to the American Library Association, in all of 2024, only 17 books were even challenged in Connecticut – a tiny fraction of a percent in a state with over 1,000 libraries holding millions of books. 
But with these bills, one librarian can exempt large categories of books from challenge (HB7014 lines 49-66; SB1271 lines 36, 42, 62, 65) and even prevent a challenge by a board of education (SB1271(1)(1), (3), (4); HB7014(1)(d)). They also exclude most of the community from making a challenge by virtue of their childless status or whether someone else has already challenged the book, even if it was years ago (SB1271 lines 14, 15, 17, 79, 84; HB 7014(1)(4)). This is unfair, discriminatory, and antidemocratic.
The legislation would also give librarians gratuitous legal immunity (SB1271 section 1(f), 2(f)) while creating a way for them to sue parents and students for “emotional distress” (SB1271 section 1(g), 2(g)). Librarians should be learning from parents, instead of getting rattled when challenged over sexually explicit materials aimed at kids, which they chose to place in the school library. 
Why are concerned parents being targeted for prosecution when some librarians have been caught watching child pornography, even in the library? The latest case of a child librarian being charged for child pornography in Connecticut was as recent as August 2024.
“Dive deeper with your finger or a butt plug! Just make sure any objects you put up there have a flared base; otherwise, your hungry heinie can gobble it up,” advises Let’s Talk About It: The Teen’s Guide to Sex, Relationships, and Being a Human, a sexually explicit and graphically illustrated book, found in some of Connecticut’s school libraries. “I’ve never seen these in the library” claims Sen. Bob Duff. But has he looked? A quick review of the website takebacktheclassroom.com, which lists many vulgar and sexually explicit books in Connecticut school libraries, with excerpts, would educate Senator Duff about what concerned parents already know confronts their children in the local school library.
Senator Duff claims these bills “create a process.” But one does not need a law to create a process. And the proposed new processes mandated by the bills are unfair. 
Setting aside whether you think a teen should be instructed to “pay for your porn,” shouldn’t all parents and members of the community be allowed to object? The bills permit exclusion of books from challenge based on the opinion of only one librarian. The librarians could classify “Let’s Talk About It” as “sexual health” material (HB7014 lines 61-63) or “appropriate” (SB1271 lines 36, 42-46, 62, 65-66) and exempt it from any book challenge by a community member or parent (HB7014 lines 49-50; SB1271 lines 36-37, 42-43). 
It is time for concerned parents and all those who share those concerns to step up and petition their legislators to oppose these two extremist and radical bills, SB1271 and HB7014.

It can save a lot of time, provide an infinite amount of research, chat with us when no one else wants to, create outlines, press releases, and ad copy. It can rewrite our emails, structure our resumes, and in the medical community, it can provide diagnoses in record time that may result in saving lives.
In education, students like it because they can finish a homework assignment or write an essay in minutes instead of hours. And for teachers, AI can generate lesson plans and rubrics, compose quizzes, design projects, and even grade student essays and exams. Those who use it say this gives them more time to be better teachers in the classroom and that the feedback AI provides can be very similar to comments they would make. I can see why using an AI program isn’t all that different from having a teaching assistant do one’s grading, and who wouldn’t love to have a TA?
But I have some concerns.

Patrice Hamilton
First, higher education is under a microscope right now, which isn’t a bad thing because we could certainly make improvements. However, with the Department of Education being dismantled, now more than ever our society needs to believe in the importance and relevance of a college degree. 
We’re all familiar with what happened when every child who played a sport went home from the end-of-the-season banquet with a trophy. It was a well-intentioned idea, but the concept backfired because many children didn’t value the awards they received. Even at a young age, they needed to feel that they earned that ribbon or statue. What happens when college degrees are seen as another form of participation trophies? If students can get AI to write their papers, complete their math homework, fill out their lab reports, and answer their exam questions, getting a degree won’t be that big of a deal. 
Graduates need to feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with sweat and sacrifice, and professionals looking to hire should see graduation as a significant achievement as well.
Second, most of us know that one problem steroids create in sports is that if some athletes use them, this increases pressure on other athletes to use them just to stay competitive. I worry about this when it comes to education. Many students want to do their own work, and if they use AI or sources on the internet, they use them to enhance learning rather than replace it, but how will their efforts stack up against content created by an algorithm? After all, those students are only human.
I spoke with a colleague who teaches math, and they told me about a math major who had taken all of their upper-level math classes in online asynchronous courses; however, when they applied for a tutoring job, they were unable to pass a basic algebra test.
When I attend conferences, I listen to advice about what instructors can do to rewrite their assignments to discourage AI use, and yes, we should do what we can. But this puts the burden on the teacher to keep revising assignments, which is not only time-consuming, but very difficult given the way AI keeps evolving and the amount of websites that host research papers and exams keeps increasing. Of course, we could use AI to revise our exams, but this all starts to feel a bit Orwellian: AI writes paper assignments and exam questions, AI is used to respond to those assignments and exams, AI grades those papers and exams—the only thing missing is human beings. Of course, if we do use AI to grade student work, we would have to inform them of that. How will this impact students and their motivation to turn in authentic work?
As a professor, it can be dispiriting to read a batch of student work, especially when I teach an online class. With asynchronous courses, the only way I get to know my students is through their writing because I don’t have the opportunity to meet them in a classroom. 
When reading discussion posts, I used to get a sense of their personalities by their word choices, their individual examples, and their unique perspectives. Each discussion post had a different voice. Sure, the writing was flawed at times, and yes, I used to complain about wordy sentences and vague statements, but I felt that I knew my students. I miss that now. 
The other day, a colleague said, “I asked my class to write a literary analysis, and many of them turned in nearly perfect papers, but when I asked them what literary analysis is, only one student could come up with an answer.” They supposedly had done literary analyses, but they didn’t know what they had done.
There’s no such thing as a free lunch, and someday I think we will pay a price for the steroid we call AI. Someone who graduates with a college degree shouldn’t have to worry about what impression their writing will make if they can’t get a fix from an AI program.
It’s tempting to get on the AI train and see where it takes us. After all, we can’t be afraid of technological innovations. Maybe it’s not important that tomorrow’s leaders know how to write or calculate answers to problems. Maybe all they need to know is how to craft good prompts and edit the results. But I think we all can agree that they do need to know how to think, and AI is eager to do that for them as well. Should everyone who uses AI review it for errors and accuracy? Sure. Will they? Sometimes.
Another concern is whether business executives will want to pay top salaries to employees who completed their classes with the help of AI. Will those high GPAs carry the weight they used to? We all are keenly aware that graduates need substantial salaries to pay off those student loans.
I’m not suggesting we get rid of AI because the benefits it offers are important, and much like social media, we can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube. We have to learn to manage both AI and social media so that they add to our lives without creating dependency. 
Artificial Intelligence needs to be regulated. We need to have clear identification of all AI created videos, text, images, and audio, and we need regulations that hold platforms responsible for hosting exams, student papers, and deepfakes. We need to require students to cite the AI they used just as they would any other human source, and we need better tools that spot AI plagiarism so that when we talk to students, we can refer to reliable evidence. 
Teachers are advised to use their intuition when it comes to student work, but this is very difficult because with programs like Grammarly, we may never get to know their authentic writing voices, and the last thing we want to do is falsely accuse a student. Many instructors have students do more of their work during class, which helps, but at the end of the day, some work has to be done outside of the classroom, and when teaching an online course, that solution is impossible to implement. 
I also think that college institutions need more limitations regarding the amount of classes a student can take online, and I would like to see more hybrid courses offered so that students are required to demonstrate their knowledge in front of an instructor once or twice during a semester. 
One major reason students choose asynchronous classes is because they offer flexibility, which is especially important to students who juggle their courses along with work and family responsibilities, but we can find a way to provide that convenience while also ensuring that students are learning what we think they are learning. I have heard that some math departments are leaning in this direction, and I hope that continues.
Social media companies like Meta and X are reducing fact-checking and putting the responsibility on the user to call out misinformation. We can’t rely on the gatekeepers of the past, which means we need a population who has information literacy skills, and we all have to protect ourselves from becoming intellectually lazy. 
People tell me that they frequently use AI at work—it saves employees time and the company money. I think that’s great, but education is a different matter. We are teaching students to not only accomplish a task, but to deepen their intellects. AI shouldn’t be a crutch and we shouldn’t let it become an addiction. I would rather read my students’ work, warts and all, then read some artificial concoction that is bulging with muscles but has no beating heart.

During the 2023-2024 academic year alone, PEN America counted over 10,000 book bans in 29 states and 220 school districts. 
Seventy-eight percent of surveyed educators said that their “students read more when they have free choice in what to read, including access to banned books,” and 81% “feel that conversations around banned books and restrictions to book access harm students.”
The data speaks for itself. Book bans have become a core facet of contemporary American politics, and continue to more forcefully occupy our collective political conscience with each passing year. 
Such censorship is a federal overreach that actively breeds illiteracy, ignorance, and intolerance. Simultaneously, these restrictions deprive states, school districts, libraries, families, and individuals of their autonomy, choice, and freedom to educate and be educated. Without protected educational rights, there is no individual and collective progression or evolution, no ability to cultivate future generations, affect global change, or resist systems of oppression. Without education, the very seats in government that create and contest bills aimed at addressing these pressing issues will not be conscientiously filled, nor their obligations dutifully fulfilled.
In order to preserve liberty, support existing educational precedents, and generate new precedents that may lead to further reform and greater literary and scholastic protections, it is necessary that the state of Connecticut show its support of civil liberties and the fundamental right to read and read freely by passing H.B. 5508: An act concerning a freedom to read.
This bill would restore agency to the state of Connecticut and its local and regional boards of education in their ability to prescribe the materials accessible in school libraries. 
Other states have already started setting legislative precedents in opposition to censorship and infringement, including California with law AB-1078 (forbids the prohibition or denial of approval of the use of instructional materials, including those in school libraries, simply for containing information about diverse groups) and Illinois with HB 2789 which became Public Act 103-0100 (holds that the State’s policy is to support and safeguard the ability of libraries and library systems to obtain materials without external restrictions, and to protect libraries and related library systems from efforts to ban, remove, or otherwise limit access to books or other resources/materials).
Beyond this data, however, I find it even more important to return to the very heart of this issue: our humanity. Ultimately, this is a matter of people, of personhood, and of the right to question and oppose, and learn and affect change. 
I remember falling in love with reading in preschool. Having access to a wide and uninhibited range of literature has helped me develop a unique identity and thought process over the course of my lifetime. Volunteering at the preschool I attended as a young child, I have seen countless other children embark on this same process of self-discovery, using these scholastic spaces and materials to self-educate and explore the world around them. I now attend Yale, speaking and engaging in political discourse, realizing and exercising my political efficacy, innately aware that so much of this opportunity has been granted to me because of the skills I developed from an expansive, inclusive, and multi-faceted education.
Participation in and resolutions of sociopolitical issues such as these require critical thinking. Critical thinking is developed through an education that begins with access. If the literature in jeopardy provides us with the developmental and social tools to question their very place in our society, it is imperative that we consider what might occur – or perhaps what might cease – in their absence.  
Without access to these materials that are now in threat of extinction, we will not have the tools to generate such discourse.
Literacy grants us knowledge. Knowledge gives us power. Power vests the next generations with the capacity to affect positive change. Ensuring this legacy begins with providing and protecting the liberty and the resources that promote a global, holistic, inclusive, productive, and universally apt education.
Discourse surrounding such controversial issues might cease to exist if we do not safeguard access to the very knowledge that assists in our development into critical thinkers and global citizens. To eliminate certain perspectives, viewpoints, and media is to effectively eliminate the ethics and integrity of education. 
If you want to protect these fundamental educational rights within the state of Connecticut, I ask that you take positive action. Show your support for this bill that currently awaits passage in the Connecticut General Assembly. Contact your local representatives. Interact with your legislators. Support school districts, libraries, and other public educational institutions in their quest to provide unmitigated access to reading materials. 
Above all, recognize the power of your voice. All of the beloved heroes and villains and protagonists and side characters from your favorite books are beloved because they had a unique voice that inspired you. They are memorable and remarkable because of the impact they made and the imprint they left. They taught you to recognize and believe in your own voice. So, out of love for them and every other person and piece of wisdom that has shaped you, protect their continued existence by using your voice now. 
Become a part of this moment in time. Become a change-agent in your present, and help to shape the future. And if you are to ban anything, work towards banning these bans.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Ahead of its vote on a bill to restrict political donations in state elections, members of the House’s multipartisan majority rejected a series of amendments that would have expanded the bill. 
Among the rejected proposals were ideas to require greater disclosure of donations funneled through so-called dark money groups enabled by the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision known as Citizens United. 
The rejected amendments, from Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, would have required prompt disclosure of donations to independent expenditure groups, required advertising disclosures, and sought to limit out-of-state contributions to groups backing ballot measures. Federal courts have struck down Alaska’s limits on out-of-state contributions to candidates.
Previous bills dealing with independent expenditures haven’t advanced to a floor vote, making the rejected amendments significant.
Inverting the usual pattern, Republican lawmakers proposed the restrictions, and they were defeated by the votes of independents and Democrats. 
Speaking on the House floor, McCabe called the lack of disclosure rules for third-party groups “a critical loophole” in state law.
Traditionally in Alaska, Republicans have supported actions to reduce limits on campaign contributions. The Republican Governors Association has repeatedly challenged disclosure rules imposed by voters in a 2020 ballot measure, and a Republican-backed lawsuit led to the elimination of Alaska’s campaign finance limits in 2022.
A ballot measure scheduled for Alaska’s 2026 elections would reimpose some limits, but if House Bill 16 becomes law, those limits would come into effect ahead of the election.
McCabe argued that HB 16 should be extended to cover independent expenditures, not just direct donations.
“Independent expenditure groups have become a big part of our political campaigns,” he said, speaking on one of his amendments.
Other lawmakers noted that most of the political mailers that filled Alaskans’ mailboxes last year were from independent expenditure groups, not politicians’ campaigns.
“Voters deserve to know who is funding the message,” McCabe said.
Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage and a sponsor of the ballot measure and HB 16, was among the lawmakers who voted against the dark-money amendments. 
“I think there is concern amongst the Alaskan public around both contribution limits and independent expenditure spending. However, the dire concern is really around the hole around campaign finance, and so to the maximum extent possible, my efforts were to try and keep the bill constrained to what was approved through the ballot measure, and to address the campaign  finance portion of this,” Schrage said.
Under the Alaska Constitution, a law can replace a ballot measure only if the underlying bill is “substantially similar” to the ballot measure.
In addition to the dark-money amendments, the House rejected a proposal to exempt most municipal elections from campaign-finance reporting requirements, and an amendment that would have prevented the recipients of state contracts — and their family members — from donating to political campaigns. 
That amendment was almost identical to a bill rejected by Hawaii’s Legislature on the same day that the Alaska House turned down the idea. Several states, including New Jersey, have so-called “pay for play” disclosure rules; the amendment proposed by Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, would have gone further by actually restricting donations.
Schrage said it went too far.
“With that specific amendment, I think my biggest concern was around the fact that family members would be prohibited from making donations to political campaigns,” Schrage said. “The courts have been pretty clear that we need to be careful about limiting people’s free speech, and thanks to Citizens United, political spending is considered free speech.”
In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission eliminated restrictions on spending by political groups unaffiliated with a particular politician. Since then, the amount of money spent by independent groups has significantly increased. So has the role of dark money contributions — money funneled through independent groups in order to conceal the identity of the donor.
A ballot measure approved by Alaska voters in 2020 requires independent groups to disclose the “true source” of their contributions, but that measure has exemptions: It doesn’t cover ballot measure groups, for example.

	Schrage said some of the rejected ideas could show up in separate legislation, but he wanted to keep HB 16 confined to the ballot measure that’s ready for a vote in 2026.
“There’s always this question of, how much do you try to do, and how much can you fit into a bill before it becomes too heavy and too controversial to make it through the process. There is a very strong desire from Alaskans to address our campaign contribution limits, and we have a very clear proposal before us. I wanted to move forward,” he said.

For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.

Using health programs to encourage work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women and disabled people.

Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The hunt for results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”

Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

Jan. 28, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s educational savings accounts designed to help pay for public or private college expenses could expand to cover private K-12 tuition, in line with federal law, beginning in 2029.
The proposed change from State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area was amended 32-11 Tuesday evening into Legislative Bill 647 after multiple hours of debate. At least 42 states already allow such savings accounts to cover tuition at K-12 private schools, which was first allowed in 2018 after passage of the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for up to $10,000 per beneficiary per year.
A 529 savings plan — in Nebraska, NEST 529 — offers tax breaks to encourage families or students to donate and allow the savings to grow tax-free. 
Multiple attempts to expand the accounts in Nebraska have stalled in recent years.
‘Great way to save’
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, who led LB 647 as chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, said he didn’t have the “foreknowledge” to use NEST 529 accounts for his children. But he “very gladly” started them for his grandchildren and suggested others do so.
“It’s a great way to save for college education, and with the implementation of this bill … those funds could also be used for primary education,” von Gillern said.

Von Gillern said that of the other states without expanded accounts — California, Oregon, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan and New York — it is “probably not a club that you would imagine Nebraska being in.”
“It sort of reminds me in grade school when they showed you pictures of five cats and a dog and said, ‘Which one doesn’t belong there?’” Sorrentino told von Gillern during the debate.
‘Subsidizing’ private school dollars
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln led opposition to Sorrentino’s measure, which he noted did not directly send public dollars to private schools. However, he and State Sen. Dunix Guereca of Omaha said it was in the same vein as the defeat of a private school voucher system last fall at the ballot box.
“We are indirectly subsidizing the tax deductions for money that goes to tuition for private K-12 education,” Dungan said of Sorrentino’s proposal, originally LB 131.

Guereca, who, along with Dungan, has been on the frontlines advocating against recent school choice proposals, said the November vote was about the “concept” of using public dollars for private schools. He said the tax breaks allowed under Sorrentino’s expanded measure could instead be used for a “plethora of other ideas,” particularly with the state’s projected budget shortfall.
“I’m afraid that if we do pass this measure then it’s a slippery slope to see more and more school privatization,” Guereca said.
Dungan raised concern that Sorrentino’s measure would not allow savings to cover K-12 public school expenses, such as for extracurriculars. Sorrentino said he was “fine” with including public schools but that doing so is not federally allowed.
Budget woes
The measure’s start date was pushed back to 2029 in part to push it beyond the state’s budget woes, not just for the next two fiscal years, at nearly $400 million in the hole with even the cuts proposed in the Appropriations Committee budget, but also following two years to mid-2028. The state would be about $700 million short of the mark future lawmakers would need to hit, based on current projections.
  State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area. Aug. 13, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Sorrentino’s measure could lead to new tax breaks of about $3-4 million each year, but he cautioned that the estimate is based on assumptions of 12,000 to 15,000 people opening new accounts and meeting the maximum $10,000 contributions to those accounts.
Of 49 state senators, he said each could come up with a different estimate. He said it could be as much as $5 million or as little as $500,000. He said he thought the number was likely closer to $3 million.
State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County said Sorrentino’s measures could alleviate public school overcrowding, possibly leading to overall cost savings to the state.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln differed from her progressive colleagues and voted for the bill, as did State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, a more moderate Democrat. State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, a Republican who has rebuffed past school choice proposals, voted against adding Sorrentino’s measure to LB 647. The other votes largely followed party lines.
Conrad said Sorrentino’s measure was “intellectually and practically and policy-based distinguishable from some of the prior measures that we have looked at.”
Said Conrad: “This measure doesn’t seem to really raise the exact kind of concerns about a dilution or diminution of public funds into private schools.”

(Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)Humanities Montana announced Tuesday it is receiving a grant of up to $250,000 from the Mellon Foundation following news its budget was slashed as part of recent federal budget cuts.
The contribution is made up of an immediate $200,000 and an additional $50,000 available in matching grants, according to a news release from Humanities Montana.
The money is part of a $15 million “emergency funding commitment” from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for all 56 states and jurisdictional councils of the Federation of State Humanities Councils, according to the news release.


Match the grant
Any donations received by Humanities Montana starting April 29, 2025, count towards the match, Humanities Montana said. Members of the public can donate to Humanities Montana by visiting www.humanitiesmontana.org.


Humanities Montana Executive Director Jill Baker said the organization is “deeply grateful and humbled” by the outpouring of support it has received in response to news early this month that its federal grant was being terminated.
“This significant investment from the Mellon Foundation is a powerful affirmation of the value of public humanities,” Baker said in a statement. “Investing in the public good, our communities, and our neighbors has always been a source of pride for Montanans. I remain hopeful that this tradition will hold.”
Humanities Montana supports arts and civics programs across the state. It passes on most of the money it receives to other organizations and arts projects, and last year, it said funding reached all 56 counties.
In the news release Tuesday, Humanities Montana said the money comes at a critical moment, when $65 million in federal support for state humanities councils has been eliminated as a result of federal cuts to the National Endowment for the Humanities.
However, Humanities Montana also said a nearly $500,000 shortfall remains.
“Additional support is necessary in order to continue providing a robust level of public humanities programming, which brings writers, poets, historians, scholars, artists, and performers to museums, community centers, parks, libraries, and educational institutions, including in public, private, and homeschool settings, across Big Sky Country,” the organization said in the news release.
On April 2, Humanities Montana received a letter from the acting chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities that said its grant was terminated “in its entirety” effective the same day, April 2.
The letter cited an executive order from the Trump administration to reduce “federal bureaucracy” and “safeguard the interests of the federal government, including its fiscal priorities.”
“The termination of your grant represents an urgent priority for the administration,” the letter said.
In the news release Tuesday, Humanities Montana said the loss totaled $725,000.
The funder and network of humanities councils praised the impact the arts have on communities in a separate news release Tuesday from the Mellon Foundation.
“The places where American communities come together to read, learn, and engage with the humanities’ vast and varied forms of knowledge and creativity are often those supported by these councils,” said Elizabeth Alexander, president of the Mellon Foundation, in a statement.
The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation describes itself as the nation’s largest supporter of the arts and humanities with a belief that the humanities and arts are essential to human understanding.
Federation of State Humanities Councils President Phoebe Stein said the support from the Mellon Foundation allows the Federation to preserve the network, along with the connections and understanding it fosters.
“This is more than a grant — it’s a lifeline for communities across the country who rely on their humanities councils’ programs and grants to fill critical needs and enrich their lives,” Stein said in a statement.

Woodside Energy Group said it has reached a final investment decision to proceed with the project in Calcasieu Parish formerly known as the Driftwood LNG Terminal. Woodside purchased Driftwood less than a year ago, betting on a project that has encountered several stops and starts since 2017, partly the result of volatility in the fossil fuels market. 
Plans include new production and processing facilities in Lake Charles that will create an estimated 16.5 million metric tons of LNG for the global fuels market.
Woodside announced later in the day it had reached a deal with BP to provide natural gas for its Louisiana facility, Reuters reported. Terms of the deal were not made public. 
Gov. Jeff Landry touted the Woodside commitment as the largest single foreign investment and greenfield project in Louisiana history. In doing so, the Republican governor invoked a slogan his Democratic predecessor, John Bel Edwards, frequently used.
“Our ‘all of the above’ approach to energy is working,” Landry said in a statement. “We have four active LNG terminals in Louisiana – more than any other state. With more than 30,000 miles of natural gas pipelines, it is clear that when it comes to LNG, Louisiana is the place to be. We are not only promising President Trump’s agenda, we are delivering it!”

Woodbury Corp., a Salt Lake City-based real estate management and development company and partner WRK Real Estate of Lincoln announced the project Tuesday, saying a groundbreaking is expected in June at the northwest corner of 72nd and Dodge Streets.
“There’s nothing like it in the area. It’s the perfect first tenant that will set the tone for the rest of The Crossroads project,” said Jeff Woodbury, senior vice president at Woodbury.
Woodbury representatives described Gamescape by Cinemark as an “immersive entertainment destination” for guests of all ages. Included is dining, movie theaters, bowling, an arcade, climbing wall, laser tag and more.
Lengthy effort to remake Omaha’s Crossroads mall site hits ‘milestone’

It is part of the first phase of the overall redevelopment initiative. That first phase covers about one-third of The Crossroads site and also is to feature apartments, office space, shopping and parking. 
The broader site — about 42 acres — has been billed by developers and city officials as an $850 million-plus mixed-use campus buoyed by $105 million in city-approved public tax-increment financing.
Mayor Jean Stothert said in a statement Tuesday that the Gamescape center “will be part of the revival of this true crossroads of our city.”
Many have criticized the drawn-out redevelopment of the prominent corner of Nebraska’s largest city. Stothert said in the release that “we can all be confident in the construction timeline” and Woodbury’s record of development.
Woodbury officials, who took over the redevelopment of the site from a previous local team, said they consider the 72nd and Dodge Streets intersection among the best commercial real estate in the state.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan Tuesday due to the federal charges that allege she tried to help a man in her courtroom avoid arrest by federal immigration agents.
Dugan was arrested Friday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the Milwaukee County courthouse and has been charged with two federal criminal offenses, felony obstruction of a federal agency and a misdemeanor for concealing a person to help them avoid arrest. 
Earlier this month, ICE and other federal agents showed up outside her courtroom to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. The federal government alleges she helped Flores-Ruiz evade them by allowing him to exit using a side door without going past the agents. The agents then apprehended him outside the courthouse on foot.
The Court said in a two-page letter that it was in the public interest to relieve Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan of her duties. The letter stated that Dugan is temporarily banned from “exercising the powers of a circuit court judge” as of Tuesday.
“In the exercise of [the Supreme Court’s] constitutional authority and in order to uphold the public’s confidence in the courts of this state during the pendency of the criminal proceeding against Judge Dugan, we conclude, on our own motion, that it is in the public interest that she be temporarily relieved of her official duties,” the Court stated.
Dugan’s legal team said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that they “are disappointed that the Court acted in unilateral fashion. We continue to assert Judge Dugan’s innocence and look forward [to] her vindication in court.”

Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, speaks to the Alaska House of Representatives on Friday, April 25, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Four years after a federal appeals court eliminated Alaska’s limits on political campaign contributions, the Alaska House of Representatives has taken a step toward reimposing them.
On Monday, the House voted 22-18 to approve House Bill 16, which mirrors the language of a ballot measure slated to go before voters in 2026.
Alaskans are expected to approve the upcoming measure by a wide margin, based on historical trends, but that approval would bring new limits into effect for the 2028 elections at the earliest. 
If the Legislature approves a substantially similar bill, it would allow limits for the 2026 election and remove the upcoming initiative from the ballot.
“This is something that Alaskans very clearly want,” said Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage and the sponsor of HB 16. Schrage is also a co-sponsor of the ballot measure.
HB 16 proposes to limit Alaskans to $2,000 in donations per candidate in each election cycle. For the governor’s race, where a lieutenant governor candidate and governor candidate run together on a single ticket, the limit would be $4,000. The limit for donations from one person to a political party or group would be $5,000.
If a group wants to donate to a candidate, the limit is $4,000, or $8,000 for the governor’s race.
Those limits would be adjusted for inflation every 10 years.
Alaska’s politicians have been able to collect unlimited amounts of campaign contributions since a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that found the state’s prior limits were unconstitutional. 
In 2021, a three-judge panel of the court ruled that a $500 annual limit — amounting to $1,000 over a two-year cycle — was too low. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a $1,075 limit set by Missouri in 1998 for a two-year cycle was constitutional; adjusted for inflation, that would be roughly $2,100 today.  
Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration declined to appeal the 2021 decision, and the Alaska Public Offices Commission implemented it starting with the 2022 election.
“This bill would allow us to reinstate those limits and again provide that protection to Alaskans — and frankly to us as elected officials — in helping to ensure that there is some faith and confidence among Alaskans in their elected officials, acting with integrity and not having undue influence on them by outsized donations,” Schrage said.
Each time ballot measures have proposed new limits for political donations, Alaskans have approved them by large margins. Public polling has shown continued large support for new restrictions.
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, has been elected to the House four times and spoke in support of the bill.
“I can tell you that, to me, putting these contribution limits in place will help us do what we should be doing, and that is spending more time discussing and hearing from our constituents, learning about the needs and concerns of the voters that we will hopefully represent, and not thinking about the biggest check writers,” he said.
Voting against the bill were 18 members of the House’s Republican minority caucus. The only member of the caucus to vote in favor of it was Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna.
Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, spoke against the bill and urged lawmakers to reject it.
“I believe in Alaskans’ right to free speech, and the courts have ruled that political contributions are free speech,” she said. 
“We’ve gone through an entire election cycle without any limits, and I have not once heard on record any specific Alaskan contributions that have given the appearance or showed proof of corruption,” Vance said.
That matters because the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that limits on campaign donations are legal only if they are needed to avoid quid-pro-quo corruption or the appearance of corruption.
Schrage responded to Vance’s point by observing that the Alaska Department of Law has already reviewed the similar campaign-limits ballot measure for constitutionality and found no problems.
“It does not get certified unless the limits herein are viewed by our own administration as being constitutional,” he said. 
Schrage said that it’s clear by state history and opinion polling that Alaskans want to restrict campaign contributions, and that legislators should advance HB 16 to the governor’s desk.
“I would just encourage my colleagues here to vote yes on the bill,” he said, “and listen to their constituents who want to see us do something concrete to improve the trust in their elected officials and in their government.”

Taking the stage Tuesday evening, Trump wasted no time in continuing to push his disproven claim that the 2020 election had been stolen, telling the audience he’d actually won the state three times while recounting his past victories in Michigan despite losing the state to former President Joe Biden in 2020 by more than 154,000 votes.
Although several banners hung throughout the university’s sports and expo center, reflecting Trump’s campaign promises to bring back American jobs and usher in a “golden age” of American manufacturing, the President spent much of his speech talking about his administration’s efforts on immigration, criticizing his political opponents and recapping his work on other campaign promises.

However Trump told attendees to expect a surge in auto jobs, crediting his tax and tariff policies, though auto industry advocates have expressed concern about the policies.
In February, Ford CEO Jim Farley warned that Trump’s 25% tariff on goods imported from neighboring Mexico and Canada threatened to “blow a hole” in the U.S. auto industry, according to a report from Reuters. 
Sandy Baruah, president and CEO of the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce has also warned that the president’s tariffs would significantly harm Detroit-area businesses with 234,000 jobs in the region relying on trade and investment with Canada.
However, the President pointed to a recent executive order he’d signed offering automakers credits for up to 15% the value of vehicles assembled in the United States to offset the value of imported parts, saying the effort would help automakers bring factories back to the U.S. as quickly as possible. 
Glenn Stevens Jr., executive director of the auto industry advocacy group MichAuto, applauded the decision alongside another order making changes to how the levies would be enforced to prevent multiple tariffs from being charged on foreign-made vehicles.
“As MichAuto has advocated since these tariffs were first announced and communicated in our March 31 letter to the Trump administration, the automotive and mobility industry needs clear lines of sight on costs and reliable supply chains to remain globally competitive. Relief from these stacked duties would offer some of that much-needed clarity and help preserve the industry’s global competitiveness at a time of critical transition and investment,” Stevens said in a statement.
“MichAuto continues to believe that an ideal outcome is an accelerated renegotiation of the [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement] to further position America and our North American strategic partners as strong competitors to China and its violations of intellectual property, over-capacity, and unfair trade practices,” he said.

“Since day one, I’ve been laser-focused on securing a new fighter mission at Selfridge and supporting the brave service members who step up for our communities every day,” Whitmer said in a statement. “I appreciate the President’s partnership on this new fighter mission that will protect jobs and show the world that Michigan is the best place to pioneer the next innovations in national defense.” 
Trump’s visit also follows the introduction of seven articles of impeachment from U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) who told the Michigan Advance Tuesday he wanted to introduce the resolution a day before the President comes to Michigan and “[Tells] us more lies about his 100 days of accomplishments.”
Thanedar’s office also unveiled four billboards in the Metro Detroit area calling for Trump’s impeachment ahead of the visit. 
“I had the television way down and I said to our great First Lady, ‘Listen, did I just hear is being impeached again?’ We’re getting good at this though,” said Trump, after mistakenly stating that Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.) was the one who brought the articles. 
Trump was impeached twice during his first administration, but was not convicted by the Senate in either case.
“They’ve gone totally crazy, these people. And you know what? They’ve totally lost their confidence.  They can’t even tell a lunatic like this dumb guy that said it. And then you have the other one that’s always with the cane. He’s always impeaching,” Trump said, referring to U.S. Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), who in February announced he would bring articles of impeachment against the president.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)One of the most cynical things Alaska legislators ever did — and that’s saying something — was vote to gut the 2002 minimum wage increase less than one year after passing it.  After trying to supplant a voter initiative approved for the 2002 election with weaker measures, Republican majorities finally took the advice of their own attorneys — that they could only moot the initiative with a bill virtually identical to the ballot measure — and passed such a bill, which included an annual cost of living adjustment and a provision requiring that the Alaska minimum wage would always be at least one dollar over the federal minimum.  Then-Speaker Pete Kott told the Daily News when the bill passed that it was preferable to letting the initiative pass since legislators wouldn’t have to wait two years to change it.  Less than a year later, they deleted the COLA and dollar-over-federal provisions.
In 2014, an initiative to raise the state minimum wage to what it would have been had the 2002 law remained intact, and restore the COLA and dollar-over-federal provisions, was approved.  Then-Speaker Mike Chenault, who had voted for both the 2002 law and the 2003 bill gutting it, tried to pull off the same cynical maneuver.  Chenault’s bill passed by one vote in the House, but Senate Republicans, to their credit, refused to play along and the initiative passed with a 70% vote.
Now Rep. Justin Ruffridge has reached into the old bag of tricks to try and gut the recently passed Ballot Measure 1 — approved with a 58% vote in November — before it even takes effect on July 1. Their HB 161 would exempt employers of less than 50 employees, and all seasonal employers, from the paid sick leave provisions of Ballot Measure 1.  
Under Alaska law, the Legislature can not repeal an initiative until two years after its adoption.  An initiative can be amended prior to two years, but the Alaska Supreme Court found in 1977 in Warren v. Thomas that the Legislature would exceed its power to amend “by passing an amendment which so vitiates the initiative as to constitute its repeal.” According to the Research and Analysis Section of the Alaska Department of Labor, 96% of Alaska’s private sector employers — the only employers subject to Ballot Measure 1 — employ fewer than 50 workers, and 43% of all private-sector workers in the state are employed by these employers.  The broad exemption for seasonal employers, regardless of size, would only increase the vitiating effect of HB 161 on the initiative and the clear intent expressed by the voters in passing it overwhelmingly.
Ballot Measure 1 was supported by a coalition of over 130 Alaska small businesses, employers who recognized the importance of providing a modest amount of paid sick leave to workers, for their well-being and productivity — and for the economic and physical health of our communities. No parent should have to decide between going to work or caring for a sick child.  Nor should they be forced to choose between losing a day’s pay or going to work sick and spreading illness to co-workers or customers.











We should protect our ability to enact needed legislation through initiatives, where the people themselves act as the Legislature.



	Seventeen states have paid sick leave laws, and none of the hysterical predictions of negative effects on their businesses or employment have come to pass.  Alaska used to be a leader in providing meaningful worker rights and protection.  Let’s at least be a follower now and afford our workers the same basic benefits enjoyed by millions of Americans in other states.
We should protect our ability to enact needed legislation through initiatives, where the people themselves act as the Legislature.  Our elected legislators should respect that process, but all too often, as in the case of HB 161, they do not.  We need to let them know that we didn’t elect them to thwart the will of the people, and that HB 161 is tantamount to a repeal of Ballot Measure 1 and should not pass.

Kim Reynolds in an effort to force the release of government records related to a decision to block The Satanic Temple of Iowa from staging an event at the Iowa State Capitol.
The lawsuit was docketed in Polk County District Court on Tuesday, four days after Reynolds sought a court injunction that would block the Des Moines Register from accessing an entirely different set of records. The Register is seeking documents pertaining to allegations about the finances of Lutheran Social Services and its affiliates, but the governor’s office has claimed the sought-after documents are covered by executive privilege and need not be disclosed.
The ACLU case also involves a claim of executive privilege by Reynolds’ office. The ACLU case stems from a June 2024 request by the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers for documents from the governor’s office that are related to the State of Iowa’s decision to cancel an Iowa Satanic Temple winter celebration in the rotunda of the Iowa State Capitol.

The governor’s office refused to produce all of the requested documents, citing executive privilege, even though, the ACLU argues, the documents in question are an executive agency report and documents related to media preparation.
Some relevant materials were turned over, but much was redacted, according to the ACLU.
“At present, this claimed ‘executive privilege’ has no limit unless one is self-imposed by the governor’s office,” the lawsuit states. “This would, contrary to the purposes, goals, and express language of Iowa’s Open Records Act, allow the governor’s office to reject the public interest in favor of free and open examination of public records solely because of the potential for inconvenience or embarrassment.”
In addition to Reynolds, the lawsuit names as a defendant Steven Blankinship, general counsel for governor.
The lawsuit seeks a court order declaring that Reynolds has violated the Iowa Open Records Law, an order enjoining the governor’s office from committing any future violations for one year, and an injunction requiring Reynolds to turn over the requested records.
The governor’s office has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, and her communications staff did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
It’s not the first time the ACLU and Reynolds have clashed over access to information. In 2023, the ACLU of Iowa successfully sued Reynolds’ office on behalf of Iowa Capital Dispatch and other media representatives and advocates for failing to respond in a timely fashion to journalists’ requests for information about the state’s response to COVID-19. The Iowa Supreme Court ultimately ruled against Reynolds, and her office was ordered to comply in a timely manner to public record requests from journalists.
The Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers, or IAF, is a public interest group based in central Iowa that focuses on secular governance, the importance of science, separation of church and state, and a transparent and responsive government.
Jason Benell, IAF’s president, said the organization “contends that it is in the interest of the public, regardless of their religious, economic, ethnic, or any other background, that our government be transparent and responsive to the needs of the governed… The governor’s office has repeatedly refused to respect the rights of Iowans by unjustly and flagrantly asserting executive privilege in order to avoid accountability in matters of public interest.”
Thomas Story, an ACLU of Iowa staff attorney, said the lawsuit is intended to challenge the governor’s claim of “an unprecedented ‘executive privilege’ to defy Iowa law. For more than half a century, the Iowa Open Records Act has ensured that the work of the state happens in the open. Now, the governor’s office has decided it alone gets to decide what the public sees. The Iowa Constitution does not give it this authority.”
Randy Evans, executive director of the Iowa Freedom of Information Council, said that as one of the plaintiffs in the 2023 lawsuit against Reynolds, the council is concerned that the refusal to turn over records concerning the planned Satanic Temple event at the Capitol was a “continuation of the governor’s desire to shield from public release documents that might cast her in a negative light.”
Evans said the “people of Iowa are entitled to evaluate their governor’s actions. That becomes difficult when the governor tries to hide behind what should be a very narrow interpretation of executive privilege.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A week after the House Committee on Judiciary struck down a proposal by the Rhode Island State Police to make it a misdemeanor for anyone under the age of 21 to gamble online, that very legislation is now headed to the chamber’s floor.
Without any debate, the committee on Tuesday reconsidered the bill to amend the state’s 2023 iGaming law and advanced it with a 10-5 vote. The legislation sponsored by Rep. Gregory Costantino, a Lincoln Democrat, would impose up to one year in prison and a $1,000 fine if anyone ages 18 to 20 bets or plays in the virtual casino. 
Bally’s Corp., which runs Rhode Island’s two casinos, manages the only iGaming app available in the state.
Fears that high-school aged kids would get hooked on iGaming led lawmakers to restrict access to anyone under 21 when state officials legalized online gaming in 2023.
Costantino’s proposal had been rejected by the committee 7-5 during its April 22 meeting amid concerns that it would criminalize an act 18-year olds are allowed to do in person or online when betting on sports. But under House rules, committee members can move to reconsider a vote as long as the bill is still in the legislative panel’s possession and the motion is made by someone who voted with the majority. 
In this case, the motion was made by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat who initially voted against the bill.
“Although it’s unusual for a bill to go up and down then come back, it’s not unheard of,” Knight told Rhode Island Current after the vote.
House committees reconsidered three bills in 2024, chamber spokesperson Larry Berman said in an email Tuesday. This year, five bills have been reconsidered among the 114 advanced to the House floor.
Berman said reconsiderations occur when new information emerges or if further clarification on a bill is needed. He added that at least two of the three committee members who missed the vote have indicated they would like the opportunity to participate.
Democrats David Bennet of Warwick and Matthew Dawson of East Providence voted in favor of Costantino’s bill. Rep. José Batista, a Providence Democrat, voted against the measure.
Asked why he made the motion and changed his vote, Knight said it was done to pass a piece of legislation “that would make everyone happy.” Also changing their votes were Reps. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat, and Rep. Marie Hopkins, a Warwick Republican.
“We’re looking for a way to get to a bill that wants to accomplish what it wants to policywise while addressing some of the objections,” Knight said. “All I can say is the bill is alive, it’s the subject of a lot of conversations and we’ll see what happens.”
Rep. Cherie Cruz, a Pawtucket Democrat, is certainly not happy that the bill is advancing to the floor without additional debate.
“I just wanted to ask a question,” she said in an interview. “And we usually can always ask a question on a bill.”

But the committee’s chairman, Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat who voted in favor of the bill, told Rhode Island Current that House rules prohibit testimony and debate on bills up for reconsideration.
Committee members can question witnesses who are there to provide clarification on the proposal. Craven indicated ahead of the meeting that a representative from the Rhode Island State Police may have wanted to have an additional chance to make the case for the legislation they are pushing.
A state trooper was present at Tuesday’s committee meeting, but did not speak.
Sgt. Ernest Adams, a detective for the State Police’s Gaming Enforcement Unit, testified at the bill’s initial hearing March 25 where he called the proposal “essential” for officers to enforce the mandated age of the iGaming law.
But Cruz told Rhode Island Current that gamers under 21 who are allowed to bet in person may not know they are breaking the law should they do it on their phones. 
“You could even be inside the casino and you’re violating the law,” Cruz said.
Joining Cruz against the proposal were Democrats Edith Ajello of Providence, Leonela Felix of Pawtucket and David Place, a Foster Republican. Cruz said the state should instead penalize minors with civil fines, much like it does for underage drinking and smoking. 
Knight disagreed.
“We’re not talking about cannabis, alcohol or tobacco,” he said. “We’re talking about gambling — it’s a different public policy question.”
An official floor vote has not been scheduled as of Tuesday evening.
Companion legislation is sponsored in the Senate by Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat. The Senate Committee on Gaming and Labor, which Ciccone chairs, held the bill for further study on March 26, as is standard procedure when legislation is first considered by a legislative panel.

(Photo by Nikki Silva/Rhode Island Current)On Monday morning, Sen Valarie Lawson’s eyes brimmed with tears as she hugged fellow lawmakers walking out of the funeral Mass honoring the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. 
Less than 36 hours later, Lawson embraced colleagues again after she was elected as the chamber’s new president. Lawson, 58, an East Providence Democrat, will be the chamber’s fifth president and its second female leader, filling the vacancy left after Ruggerio died on April 21.
Lawson secured nearly two-thirds of support among the 36 other state senators during Tuesday’s leadership elections at the Rhode Island State House, with 24 votes in a three-way contest against Sen. Ryan Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat, and Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican. Pearson secured eight votes, all Democrats, while de la Cruz claimed all four Senate Republican votes.
Sen. Leonidas Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat, abstained.
Yet tensions linger in the State House’s upper chamber amid concerns over potential conflicts of interest with Lawson’s day job as head of the state teachers union and her surprising alliance with conservative Democratic Sen. Frank Ciccone.
Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, was elected as Senate majority leader during the party caucus, having teamed up with Lawson on a slate ticket confirmed last week. Both Lawson and Ciccone faced challenges from within their own party; Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat, also sought the president role, while Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, was put up as an alternative to Ciccone for the majority leader role.
Nearly one-third of Democrats backed Pearson and an even higher share — 10 — threw their support behind DiMario during the party caucus Tuesday.
Addressing the chamber following the election, Lawson pledged to “work tirelessly” and with “utmost respect” for her fellow senators.
“Thank you, thank you, your trust in me means more than I can ever express,” Lawson said. “Serving as president of the Rhode Island Senate will truly be the honor of a lifetime.”
First elected in 2018, Lawson is a former high school history teacher. She has served as president of the National Education Association of Rhode Island since 2023 — the same year she became Senate majority whip following the death of former whip Maryellen Goodwin. Lawson ascended within the chamber again last year, when Ruggerio picked her as his second-in-command, replacing Pearson after a falling out between the two allies.

Conflicting interests 
Speaking to reporters after the votes, Lawson dismissed concerns about potential conflicts between her union job and the Senate leadership role. She noted she has sought advisory opinions from the state ethics panel previously regarding potential overlap, though none specific to her new role as Senate president.
As the chamber’s leader, Lawson now has outsized power to negotiate across the rotunda with the House and decide which bills advance to the Senate floor, setting the stage for conflicts on a host of education-related issues, said John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island.
Senate rank-and-file members can recuse themselves by not voting or leaving the dais or even the room when their jobs or personal relationships conflict with legislative business, Marion said in an interview Monday.
“The Senate president, the buck stops there,” Marion said. “It makes recusal an insufficient tool for dealing with potential conflicts of interest.”
Similarly, as president of the 12,000-member state teachers union, Lawson holds key decision-making power over its legislative agenda and policy priorities. Ruggerio, who worked as an administrator for a branch of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, stepped down from his union job when he was elected as Senate president in 2017. 
Sen. Ana Quezada, a Providence Democrat, questioned Lawson’s ability to fairly consider bills related to the state takeover of Providence Public Schools. Quezada backed Pearson for Senate president for this reason.

“My organization doesn’t represent Providence,” Lawson said, speaking to reporters after the vote. Providence teachers are represented instead by the Providence Teachers Union, a local of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals and the American Federation of Teachers.
Lawson pledged to continue her “due diligence” regarding potential conflicts of interest, which may include seeking a new advisory opinion from the Rhode Island Ethics Commission, though she did not commit either way.
With less than two months until the Rhode Island General Assembly concludes its 2025 session, Lawson’s immediate focus turns to the chamber’s legislative priorities. She stressed a variety of health care bills, including increasing reimbursement rates for primary care providers and a study panel considering a state medical school as two examples. She was noncommittal when asked about a state ban on assault-style weapons, despite being a co-sponsor on the Senate legislation.
“We’ll go through the process and see what happens,” she said.
Much like Ruggerio, who has long opposed state-level restrictions on guns, Ciccone said he would oppose the assault weapons ban as currently drafted. Ciccone is a licensed federal firearms dealer who sells guns out of the basement of his Silver Lake home; he also voted against the safe storage mandate signed into law in 2024.

‘Strong enough for two strong women’
Ciccone’s voting record on guns, along with reproductive rights and protections for the LGBTQ+ community, rankled progressive lawmakers and advocacy groups. Sen. Pamela Lauria, a Barrington Democrat, nominated DiMario as an alternative to Ciccone for majority leader during the party caucus Tuesday.
“We all deserve to vote for someone we believe in,” Lauria said, insisting the Senate was “strong enough for two strong women.”
DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, lost the bid for second-in-command to Ciccone by 12 votes, with one abstention from Sen. Lammis Vargas, a Cranston Democrat. Most of DiMario’s supporters also backed Pearson for president, though some split their support between the competing sides.
Quezada backed Pearson for president but Ciccone for majority leader. In an interview, she cited Ciccone’s support for licenses for undocumented immigrants and labor protections as reasons why he secured her vote.
Sen. Jonathon Acosta, a Central Falls Democrat, also backed DiMario but abstained from choosing between Pearson and Lawson for president during the caucus. (He voted for Pearson during the floor vote, though). 
“I would much rather be spending time with my kids right now, grilling some food, smoking a joint and having a drink,” Acosta said. “On the days this job has felt like we’re doing something, it’s worth it. For the last year and a half, this job has felt like political theater.”

Drama descended upon the Senate early last year, after a private falling out between Ruggerio and Pearson became public. The conflict between the two occurred after Pearson visited Ruggerio at his home to discuss Ruggerio’s health and his ability to lead.
At the same time, Ruggerio confirmed his third diagnosis with cancer; his health struggles forced him to miss long stretches of the 2024 session and nearly all of the 2025 legislative session, as well as much of the door-to-door campaigning leading up to his reelection in November. 
Pearson unsuccessfully attempted to oust Ruggerio from the president seat during a caucus after the November election, airing tensions brewing for months between opposing factions of Senate Democrats. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Pearson said he felt vindicated in his prior insistence that Ruggerio’s illnesses had compromised his leadership, and in turn, the chamber’s function.

Vindicated
“My worst nightmare, what I was trying to prevent for this chamber, has played out exactly as I had a nightmare about it,” Pearson said.
He relayed a very different series of events than Ruggerio regarding the aftermath of their closed-door conversation last year. As Pearson tells it, when he went to the then-president with concerns about Ruggerio’s health, Ruggerio hugged him, and thanked him for his honesty. It was only after other senators got in Ruggerio’s ear, convincing him that Pearson’s concern was actually a power grab, that Ruggerio turned on Pearson, Pearson said.
Sen. Dawn Euer, a Newport Democrat, admitted during the floor session Tuesday that she believed the “rumors” spread about Pearson last year, but changed her mind after seeing Ruggerio’s health firsthand as former chair of the Senate Committee on Judiciary.
Euer alleged Pearson was “bullied” by other senators to advance their own interests.
“We need leadership that is going to tell the truth to members of this chamber, even when it’s hard,” Euer said.
While the battle between Pearson and Lawson for president was not a close vote, it could have been. Pearson alleged he had verbal support from nearly half of the chamber’s Senate Democrats even a day prior, including from Ciccone, who agreed to back Pearson as president if he was made majority leader.
Ciccone could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday night. 
In the frenzy of phone calls leading up to Tuesday’s leadership elections, one conversation never happened: between Pearson and Lawson. Pearson said his calls to Lawson went unanswered, noting that she has not responded to his calls or texts for a year.
Lawson walked away when asked by reporters about discussions with Pearson for a potential leadership slate.
The Senate will reconvene at 4 p.m. Wednesday; the only item on its agenda is a tribute to Ruggerio. 
A special election will be held later this year to fill the Senate District 4 seat spanning sections of Providence and North Providence held by Ruggerio since 1985; a date has not been determined.

Keith Stokes will take over the voluntary role of delivering lectures about Rhode Island’s past at special events and formal ceremonies, Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore announced Tuesday.
The state established the position in 2012. State law specifies that the historian laureate serves a five-year term. Stokes, a Newport resident, will serve through April 30, 2030.
Stokes will make his first appearance as historian laureate at the Rhode Island Independence Day event at the Rhode Island State House on Saturday, May 3. He said he was honored and humbled to be the state’s historian laureate.
“I am profoundly honored to be appointed as Rhode Island’s Historian Laureate,” Stokes wrote in a post on LinkedIn. “Historical interpretation has long served as a beacon of guidance, particularly during times of social, economic, and cultural transformation. My mission is to illuminate Rhode Island and America’s past in a way that inspires us all, nurturing a collective sense of identity and purpose.”
Stokes was chosen from a field of eight candidates who applied for the position after Patrick Conley, the first and only person to have been historian laureate, chose not to seek reappointment earlier this year. 
Other applicants included Steve Frias, a former Rhode Island Republican National Committeeman and member of the RI250 Commission; Allison Horrocks, a park ranger at the  Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park in Pawtucket who is also a podcast host and author; David Kohnen and associate professor at the. U.S. Naval War College in Newport; Scott Molloy, a former professor of labor and industrial relations at the University of Rhode Island; Michael Simpson, an adjunct professor at Johnson & Wales University who runs Hidden History Tours of Rhode Island as well as the On This Day in Rhode Island History account on X;  Maureen Taylor, a genealogist and nationally-renowened photo detective; and Catherine Zipf, executive director of the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society.
The Secretary of State’s announcement highlighted Stokes’ “passion for historical research” drawn from his African, Jewish, and Caribbean family roots. Stokes has appeared on C-SPAN, Fox’s Legends & Lies, and TED Talks. 
He serves as a consulting historian for the Rhode Island Black Heritage Society, was former state advisor for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. He also serves on the RI250 Commission.
Stokes was the lead researcher and author of the 2024 publication “A Matter of Truth,” which examined and documented the role of the state and city of Providence  in supporting a “separate and unequal” existence for people of color.
Stokes holds a master’s degree in social policy administration from the University of Chicago. Last May, he was named the as new associate director of the Rhode Island Department of Administration’s Division of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.
“Ensuring that Rhode Islanders learn about and continue to pass on our state’s history is one of my top priorities as Secretary of State,” Amore, a former history teacher, said in a statement. “I am confident that Keith’s rich background and breadth of experience in historical research, storytelling, and education will continue to be an incredible asset to our state in this role.”
From 2010 to 2012, Stokes served as the head of the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation – now Rhode Island Commerce Corporation. His tenure there occurred during the ill-fated 38 Studios deal that left the state on the hook for a $78 million loan guarantee after the company folded two years after relocating to the state. Stokes also served 15 years as executive director of the Newport County Chamber of Commerce. 
Stokes was named director of economic development for the city of Providence in October 2021 and served for over a year until Mayor Brett Smiley took office.

Data centers are driving near-term energy demand in the region, according to a new regional power forecast from the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. (Photo by Rian Dundon/Oregon Capital Chronicle)Demand for electricity in the Northwest could double by 2046, according to a new energy forecast from regional experts.
Over the next two decades, demand could increase by between 1.8% and 3.1% annually, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council heard Tuesday. The projected growth will come primarily from companies building more data centers in the region, more electric vehicles on roads, electrifying buildings, computer chip manufacturing and the production of “green hydrogen” created by running an electrical current through water to split the molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.
Council staff presented the 20-year forecast for electricity demand in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and western Montana Tuesday to the council’s eight, governor-appointed members. Each state’s governor gets to appoint two representatives.
“The data centers, naturally in our forecasts, are the very early load growth driver here. They’re the big driver of near term demand,” Steven Simmons, senior energy forecasting analyst, told the council. Energy demand from data centers and from all electric vehicles in the region are expected to be equal by 2046, and demand from EVs is likely to surpass data center demand after 2046, Simmons said.
Residential and commercial demand, which includes forecasted energy demand for electric vehicle charging at homes and buildings, but does not include data centers, is expected to grow more gradually. Demand for residential and commercial energy in Washington alone will equal the combined demand from those sectors in Oregon, Idaho and Montana during the next two decades.
The energy forecast, part of the council’s forthcoming 9th Northwest Regional Power Plan to manage demand, does not yet include some possible variables that could reduce future demand, such as improved energy efficiency in cars, buildings and some industries as a response to demand, as well as growing adoption of rooftop solar on residential and commercial buildings.
But rapidly growing demand now means electricity grids in the Northwest and across the U.S. are encountering transmission constraints, and scaling infrastructure to meet demand has been slow due to supply chain delays and issues, staff said.
 Data centers 

Council staff expect the biggest growth in data center and computer chip energy demand will occur in eastern Oregon, eastern Washington, and the Portland and Boise metro areas, based on historical trends and announced projects.
There are more than 100 data centers in Oregon, according to the company Data Center Map, and there are more than 5,000 data centers throughout the U.S. according to Statista — the most in any country.
Oregon’s data center market is the fifth largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and X, formerly named Twitter, have massive data centers in eastern Oregon as well as in The Dalles, Hillsboro and Prineville.
 What’s next

To develop its next power plan, the council will evaluate supply side resources, including the potential for more regional windfarms, utility-scale and small-scale solar installations, better battery storage and more geothermal and fracked gas sources, among other options.
The council has published regional power plans about every five years since 1983, to lay out how the region will maintain an affordable and adequate power supply. A draft of the plan, an update from the last one that was published in 2021, is expected to be ready for public review and input by July 2026 and would be finalized by late 2026, according to council spokesperson Peter Jensen.
The Northwest Power and Conservation Council was formed in 1981 following passage of the federal Northwest Power Act. That act directed the four states to work collaboratively on regional energy planning and to stop the decline of native Columbia Basin fish species that have suffered massive population losses over the last century, primarily from the development of hydroelectric dams in the region.
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek in February appointed two new Oregon representatives to the council: Margaret Hoffmann, of Bend, and Chuck Sams, of Pendleton. Hoffman is the former Oregon director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development program and energy adviser to former Oregon Govs. John Kitzhaber and Kate Brown.
Sams, former executive director of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, was most recently director of the National Park Service. Sams briefly served on the council in 2021 before he was appointed to run the Park Service.

CHATHAM — The driver of a vehicle involved in a deadly crash Monday at an after-school program formerly worked for the Illinois State Police, the agency investigating the crash.

The ISP identified the driver as Marianne Akers, 44, of Chatham. She worked at the ISP from June 2006 to August 2018, an ISP spokesman confirmed Tuesday.

The crash occurred at 3:20 p.m. Monday when Akers’ black Jeep left the road and traveled through a field, hitting the east side of a building that housed the YNOT, which stands for Youth Needing Other Things, an after-school camp in Chatham. The car drove through the building, striking several children and workers, before it exited the other side.

Those killed were Ainsley Johnson, 8; Kathryn Corley, 7; Alma Buhnerkempe, 7, all of Chatham, and Rylee Britton, 18, of Springfield, a counselor. All the victims died of blunt force trauma, according to Sangamon County Coroner Jim Allmon.

Six other children were hospitalized, one in critical condition.

The building that houses the after-school program has a gym on the bottom floor and play areas upstairs. Children often sat on the wall during playtime at the gym.

After crashing through the building, the SUV traveled across a basketball court then hit a light pole and a fence around a small park near the Chatham water tower.

Akers was the only one in the vehicle and was not injured, according to police. She was taken to a local hospital for evaluation.

The cause of the crash remains under investigation; toxicology reports are pending. Police said Monday it was not a targeted attack.

Akers is a current employee of the Illinois Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Business Services, according to an IDOT spokesman. She has been employed by the agency since November 2023.

She also is a former cafeteria employee of Glenwood High School in Chatham.

Sangamon County State’s Attorney John Milhiser said Tuesday that police have made no arrests.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families impacted by this terrible tragedy,” Milhiser said.

Chatham, a close-knit community of 15,000 people, is about 2.8 miles from the state capital of Springfield. Chatham schools are closed for the rest of the week.

Gov. JB Pritzker commented on the tragedy late Monday.

“I am horrified and deeply saddened by the deaths of children and numerous injuries in Chatham this afternoon,” Pritzker said in a statement. “My heart is heavy for these families and the unimaginable grief they’re experiencing — something that no parent should ever have to endure.”

Studio M Dance Centre in Chatham where Ainsley Johnson danced posted a tribute on social media Tuesday.

“Ainsley was such a sweet and sassy dancer/tumbler at our Studio and Complex — bringing joy, passion, and lots of laughter to her peers in class and her dance teachers. Her spirit will always be a part of our dance family, and she will be deeply missed every single day,” the message said.

Britton was preparing to attend the University of Iowa to study English and secondary education. One of her fellow Glenwood High School students stated that she “was always kind to everyone.”

Community members shared several Facebook posts Monday urging residents to donate blood. By Tuesday morning, all of the time slots were booked until Friday. By Tuesday afternoon, Glenwood High School Student Council had raised over $100,000 for the victims’ families through a GoFundMe page.

Chatham Village President Dave Kimsey ordered all flags in Chatham to be flown at half-staff for the next week. A candlelight vigil was to be held Tuesday night at Village Square Park, and another will be held Wednesday night at Glenwood High School.

In a Facebook post Tuesday, SIU Medicine announced that counseling and trauma support for Chatham residents will be available at Chatham Presbyterian Church on Wednesday and Thursday.

(Maryland GovPics, CC BY 2.0 , via Wikimedia Commons)Union leaders are meeting in Hershey this week for the Pennsylvania Conference of Teamsters annual convention.
Some of Pennsylvania’s most powerful politicians, like Gov. Josh Shapiro, state House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) and U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) have already appeared to voice their support.
Teamsters leaders at the gathering discussed their goals for the year, and broadly outlined strategies in areas from workplace organizing to making political endorsements.
But many who spoke had a particular target in their sights: Amazon.
The union has been at odds with the company for years over working conditions imposed on their drivers and warehouse staff. And they’ve fought Amazon’s decision to classify some workers as independent contractors, which lets the company off the hook for providing certain benefits, like health and insurance, and guarantees, like minimum wage.
The feud reached a boiling point during the last holiday season, when Teamsters struck at Amazon warehouse location across the country over the company’s refusal to bargain with the group. Teamsters also organized picket lines at several non-union locations in Pennsylvania.
But speakers at the Hershey conference said that action was just the opening salvo.
“This is the beginning of a war with Amazon,” said William Hamilton, president of the Pennsylvania Conference of Teamsters, which represents around 95,000 workers in warehouse, transport and other industries. “Amazon started the war on workers because they’ve continually attacked workers across this country and mistreated them. They created this environment of unsafe conditions, of low pay, of doing things to people that people on the outside would never even consider to be something an employer should be doing.
Amazon has come under scrutiny in the past for the low wages it pays its workers, as well as policies critics say have led to unsafe conditions. In particular, it’s been reported that Amazon aggressively tracks worker productivity, leading some drivers and warehouse staff to skip bathroom and food breaks.
Across the country, Teamsters have been leading an aggressive drive to organize the company’s workers, as well as raising awareness among lawmakers, regulators and media about poor working conditions.
Teamsters have also been fighting the company in court too. Last week, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled that Amazon had to come to the bargaining table with a local Teamsters chapter representing distribution center workers for the company in San Francisco.
That follows another victory last year when the NLRB sided with Teamsters, who were calling for  Amazon delivery drivers in Palmdale, California, to be classified as “joint employees” instead of independent contractors.

Despite the legal victories, Randy Korgan, the national director of the Teamsters’ Amazon division, said he believes the battle must be waged on the ground by workers, instead of focusing on courts and state capitols.
“It’s been multiple decades since that system has truly done what it’s supposed to do, which is protect workers in an expeditious way,” Korgan told attendees at the Pennsylvania conference. “What we’re doing is we’re building committees. We’re educating workers and we’re getting them to understand that you’re not going to get your employer to recognize anything until you shut it down.”
Korgan noted that the union organized nearly 10,000 Amazon workers in 2024 alone. He said that wasn’t done in a “traditional setting.” Instead he and others encouraged workers to stage walkouts and “take direct action.”
Liana Dalton, an organizer for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters’ Amazon division said that work needs to be continued in Pennsylvania, where she hopes to see more Amazon facilities and workers unionize, and build capacity for a potential strike. 
And she’s hopeful. She said she’s heard from many who were inspired by the strike last winter, some of whom went to New York to join a picket line. 
“We’ve gotta build this and we’ve gotta scale it, so that we shut down the entire market in these key regions,” Dalton said. 
Amazon also came up repeatedly in discussions of the union’s political goals.
Thomas Doyle, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters’ state program director, said the union is also pushing bills in state legislatures around the country in the hopes of passing laws to improve conditions for Amazon warehouse workers.

Doyle noted that warehouse workers at Amazon are injured at higher rates than many companies in the sector. And he cited the company’s policies when discussing a bill the union is pushing around the country
It would require warehouses to disclose productivity quotas to their workforce, a practice Doyle said that Amazon has not done in some circumstances, leading to workers rushing and increasing the potential for injury.
“In [typical] warehouses, we understand there are productivity quotas, but our workers are made aware of what they’re being measured against,” Doyle said. “This bill would mandate that a company has to make their workers aware of what they’re being measured against. So by eliminating that invisible clock, workers will be able to pace themself in a safer manner.”
Doyle said that bills accomplishing this have already passed in five states, California, New York, Minnesota, Washington and Oregon. And he’s hoping for progress in Pennsylvania as well.
Doyle also said the Teamsters advocacy arm will be pushing for other measures. Those would require human supervision in commercially used autonomous vehicles; require companies provide certain protections for workers exposed to extreme temperatures; and ban mandatory “captive audience meetings” discussing either religion or politics, which would be defined to include discussions of unionization. Such meetings are sometimes used by employers to disparage unionization efforts during work hours. 
Sam Gardner-Bird, the national political coordinator for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, also spoke to address the union’s donation strategy for its Political Action Committee.
He said that this year, the group would not automatically give a maximum-allowable donation — typically $5,000 — to candidates that have historically been allies of the Teamsters early in the election cycle. Instead, regardless of their history, a PAC donation will depend on how they vote and act.
“What we’ve seen a lot of times, with some of these long relationships. is that they get complacent,” Gardner-Bird said. “Sometimes, we need to remind them that we’re watching everything they do. And if they’re assuming that they’re gonna get the drive contribution, they’re never gonna change.”
The move is partly an effort to exert greater influence, and partly a practical matter.
“Every single drive dollar we have is a sacrifice made by a member,” Gardner-Bird said. “It’s taken off their paycheck and they choose to do that. So, we have to be good stewards of this money.”
Specifically, he said the change is, in part, a reaction to some longtime recipients of Teamsters PAC funding refusing to sign a letter backing UPS and Amazon workers’ right to strike.
“They should know better,” Gardner-Bird said. “Every letter they don’t sign, every initiative they don’t support, we’re watching that.”
Behind the speakers’ podium was a sign that urged a ‘yes’ vote on retention for Pennsylvania’s three liberal Supreme Court justices, who will be on the ballot in November.
Discussing the importance of Judicial races, Gardner-Bird pointed to the recent victory of a Teamsters-backed candidate for the state Supreme Court in Wisconsin, Susan Crawford
“These courts are important,” he said. “That court ruled that Amazon flex drivers are full time employees and not independent contractors. So we gotta take these races seriously across the board.”
The conference will continue Wednesday.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Amazon_warehouse_in_Maryland-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 21:05:05.797009

How large it ought to be or where are open questions, but a work group appointed to “reset” discussions on a new men’s prison agreed on that much Tuesday during the second of its four planned meetings.
State Attorney General Marty Jackley sat silent through more than four hours of testimony and public comment before asking his fellow members of “Project Prison Reset” to support a replacement for the penitentiary, the 144-year-old quartzite monolith in Sioux Falls known as “The Hill.”

By then, group members had reviewed a dozen potential sites for a new prison, submitted by landowners through a request for information. They’d also sat through presentations on mental health and occupational programming at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield, heard from city residents on the medium security facility’s value to the Bon Homme County city of 1,900, and had reassured those residents that it would remain a part of the Department of Corrections’ long-term facility plans regardless of what happens with the penitentiary.
With The Hill, Jackley said, the path forward is clear. It’s overcrowded, outdated and unsafe, he said, citing the case of a correctional officer killed by two inmates in 2011 as evidence of the dangers presented by the status quo.
“We can’t do nothing,” Jackley said. “We have to do something.”
Group agrees: New prison is necessary
The unanimous vote in favor of Jackley’s motion answers the first of three questions posed in the executive order from Gov. Larry Rhoden that created the group. At a special session in July, the group is meant to deliver recommendations on how large a prison is needed and where to put it, using the results of a consultant’s report on the state’s existing facilities as a guide.
Rhoden backed a plan to build an $825 million, 1,500-bed men’s facility on a controversial Lincoln County site during this year’s legislative session. The governor has called the penitentiary “gothic,” and said the site south of Sioux Falls that inspired an ongoing legal battle from neighbors was a “gift from God,” but was unable to sway lawmakers skeptical about the size, site and price tag.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen was appointed to lead Project Prison Reset after the legislative rebuffing. On Tuesday before the vote, Venhuizen said he agrees with Jackley on the need, but pointed out that the group’s schedule envisioned a review of the consultant’s report before answering any of the questions posed to it.
But “if you feel that we already know enough to answer the first question,” he said, “I think that is also very defensible.”
Just one work group member suggested otherwise.

Dell Rapids Republican Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, who announced a 2026 run for governor last week, tried unsuccessfully to convince the group to hold off on supporting a replacement. 
Hansen and his announced running mate, Canton Republican Rep. Karla Lems, were vocal opponents of the 1,500-bed plan that failed during the legislative session. Hansen pointed to a presentation on Springfield’s Governor’s House program from earlier in the afternoon. Inmates who build those affordable housing units are less likely to return to prison, the group learned. 
Why not explore options for reducing repeat offenses through programming before committing to new facilities, he asked?
“From everything that I’ve studied, we’re an outlier, and it’s really high,” Hansen said. “Before we go jumping into whether we need a new prison, I really think we should pause. Maybe it’s part of that report – I would presume it is – what are other states doing?”
But Rep. Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said the needs are immediate. Even if the state were to keep The Hill, he said, “we’ve got 365 more people than we’re supposed to” in the building.
“Even if you disagree with a few of these members on the panel and say ‘I still think The Hill’s still viable,’ etcetera, we’ve still got to find room for 365 more people,” Karr said.
The penitentiary has some supporters. A former inmate who testified Tuesday said he spent time there and at the Federal Correctional Institution of Leavenworth in Kansas, a prison of similar vintage.
“The Hill is functional,” said Paul Cooper, who’s employed as a cook in Sioux Falls. “It’s clean, productive. I completely disagree with the fact that it needs to be rebuilt.”
Doug Weber, a former penitentiary warden who lobbied lawmakers to vote down the 1,500-bed proposal, told South Dakota Searchlight that The Hill is functional if maintained. Darin Young, the now-former warden who took the job upon Weber’s retirement, called the building “beautiful” in a recent interview with The Scouting Report podcast.
Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead offered a different take on Tuesday.
“I don’t need a consultant to tell me that place is a pit,” Milstead said. “I would not want my son or daughter working there.”
Hansen and Lems ultimately joined every other member of the task force in supporting Jackley’s motion.
Possible locations
Milstead spoke up in favor of consultation with neighbors during the earlier discussions on possible sites.
The state got 12 pitches from landowners for possible sites through its request for information. Four were outside of Sioux Falls, in Huron, Grant County (northeast of Watertown), Aberdeen and Mitchell.
Prison work group peppered with public testimony in first Sioux Falls meeting

Another eight were in the Sioux Falls area, including near the Lincoln County cities of Canton and Worthing and in the Sioux Falls development park that’s home to the city’s Amazon distribution center. The former Citibank campus just north of the current penitentiary was also offered up as an option, and multiple work group members toured that site recently.
Ryan Brunner, a policy adviser for Rhoden, presented the proposals on a spreadsheet and noted that some arrived as recently as Monday evening. The goal, he said, is to fill in the spreadsheet with details on each site’s cost, serviceability for utilities and other factors in the coming weeks.
“Is there some way you can put in there what the neighbors think?” Milstead said. “Some of these are in places where homes are going in nearby.”
Brunner said that will be a consideration for any site, as would issues like proximity to 100-year floodplains or interstates and workforce availability. The consultant hired to study the state’s needs can fully study three sites once the group narrows its options.
As far as public comments, Venhuizen said he doubts neighbors will be silent. Opposition from those who live near the initially proposed Lincoln County site – which is still on the table as an option for the work group – spoke up quickly.
“We put this list out yesterday,” Venhuizen said. “I’m sure we’ll know what the neighbors think in pretty short order.”

The new executive order rescinds a previous mandate last week prohibiting permitted burns statewide through the end of the month. With the new order, burns are allowed in eastern Nebraska unless there is an active red flag warning issued by the National Weather Service for a specific area.
The initial burn ban came after a prescribed fire April 21 got out of control in the Plum Creek area near Johnstown in Brown County.

As of Tuesday afternoon, more than a week after the fire started, containment was up to 95%, according to the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency. Johnstown Fire as well as Nebraska Game and Parks were on scene for a couple of hot spots on the northern perimeter as needed.
The new burn ban runs south along U.S. Highway 81 from the South Dakota border to Highway 92. It then goes west to U.S. Highway 281 and runs south to the Kansas border.

Trump has invoked the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act for just the fourth time in U.S. history in an attempt to expedite the removals of hundreds of people the administration claims are part of an “invasion” of the United States by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
Citing the authority granted to it by the 1798 law, the administration sent 137 detainees to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador before multiple federal courts, including one in Colorado, ordered a halt to such removals over due process concerns. U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s temporary restraining order against the removal of any detainees from Colorado under the AEA is set to remain in effect until at least May 6.

Trump’s Department of Justice appealed Sweeney’s ruling to the 10th Circuit last week, asking the court to suspend the TRO pending appeal and arguing that it causes “irreparable harm” by “interfer(ing) with the President’s core authority to protect the nation.”
A panel of three appellate judges — Judges Harris L. Hartz, Gregory Alan Phillips and Joel M. Carson — bluntly dismissed that argument in Tuesday’s order denying the DOJ’s motion.
“Given the important unresolved issues under the Alien Enemies Act and the ruling of the United States Supreme Court that no one in that proceeding be removed under the AEA until further order of that Court … there is no realistic possibility that the government could remove any member of the class from this country before final expiration of the TRO on May 6, 2025,” the judges wrote. “Accordingly, the emergency motion for a stay is denied.”
The case, D.B.U. v. Trump, originated earlier this month as a petition for habeas corpus and proposed class action by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora. The plaintiffs, who are identified by their initials, D.B.U. and R.M.M., say they have been falsely identified as Tren de Aragua members by the Trump administration and fear imminent deportation to the CECOT facility, criticized by human rights groups for its crowded and abusive conditions.
About 90% of the deportees sent to CECOT last month had no criminal record, according to Bloomberg. At least one, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members for other deportees say that they were falsely identified as TdA members because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team. Trump has openly floated plans to send American citizens to CECOT next.
Sweeney’s order required the Trump administration to provide at least 21 days’ notice, written in a language the individual understands, to any detainee designated for removal under the AEA. It also provisionally certified the class that the two plaintiffs seek to represent, blocking the removal of “all noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to” Trump’s March 14 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act. ACLU attorneys estimate that could apply to more than 100 detainees held at the Aurora detention center.
In U.S. District Court proceedings in the case, the DOJ argued in a Monday filing that Sweeney should decline to certify the case as a class action, claiming again that D.B.U. and R.M.M. are not targeted for AEA removals and haven’t shown they “are members of the class they seek to represent.”
But the ACLU has filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would extend and clarify the terms of Sweeney’s TRO for the plaintiffs and all members of the proposed class.
“Without an injunction, the government will be free to send hundreds more individuals, including Petitioners and class members, to the notorious Salvadoran prison where they may be held incommunicado for the rest of their lives,” ACLU attorneys wrote in an April 25 filing. “The harm is only magnified by the government’s position that mistakes cannot be remedied, and once an individual is in a foreign prison, they are stuck there.”

SPRINGFIELD – Advocates for after-school programs that provide tutoring, recreation and other services made their case again Tuesday for a $50 million state appropriation to restore programs in some schools where funding has run out and to expand them into more schools.

SPRINGFIELD – Advocates for after-school programs that provide tutoring, recreation and other services made their case again Tuesday for a $50 million state appropriation to restore programs in some schools where funding has run out and to expand them into more schools.

“There are decades of research that supports that after-school programs improve school day performance, grades and attendance, helps reduce violence, and also supports working class families,” Rep. Aaron Ortiz, D-Chicago, told a House budget committee Tuesday.

Ortiz is the lead sponsor of House Bill 3082, which calls for $50 million to be distributed by the Illinois State Board of Education through a competitive grant program to entities that seek to provide tutoring and other enrichment services in high-poverty schools, where 40% or more of the students come from low-income households.

That’s the same amount of money advocates asked for, and lawmakers provided, in the current fiscal year’s budget. But 10 months into the fiscal year, those advocates say that money still has not been distributed.

“What we've been hearing is that the governor's office has been waiting for legislative intent,” Susan Stanton, executive director of the advocacy group ACT Now, told the committee. “We've kind of heard things back and forth from both the governor's office and ISBE and legislators. And we've yet to get a clear answer on why the money wasn't released.”

The after-school programs have traditionally received federal funding through the Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program, which distributes money for programs in high-poverty areas throughout the country.

Stanton, whose organization represents more than 2,000 after-school programs, said that Illinois typically receives about $56 million a year through that program. But in 2023, she said, ISBE over-allocated the funds it had available. As a result, it was unable to renew some of the grants that were expiring or open a new competitive grant cycle that year, resulting in a large number of after-school programs losing their funding and going out of business.

“The large-scale rolling-off of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers grants has led to 27,000 students losing programs and 2,000 staff members losing their jobs,” Stanton said. “Funding appropriated by this committee and the General Assembly would provide a lifeline to these students and bring back stability to the communities that need it most in Illinois.”

She said even with full federal funding, there is more need for after-school programs in Illinois than those funds would cover, and the additional state funds would make after-school programming more accessible throughout the state.

Stanton said during an interview after Tuesday’s committee hearing that she remains hopeful the $50 million included in the current budget will eventually be distributed. In the meantime, she said, her organization is pushing for funding in next year’s budget.

The governor’s office has said previously that the money was included in this year’s appropriations bill without any clear instructions about how to distribute it and that the administration has been consulting with legislative leaders about what their specific intent was for the money.

“We understand the urgency surrounding after-school programming and remain committed to ensuring that these resources are allocated in a way that best serves students and families across Illinois,” Pritzker’s press secretary Alex Gough said in an email statement Tuesday. “Per the last budget agreement, we are awaiting direction from the General Assembly as to where this funding will be distributed.”

Tuesday’s hearing was a “subject matter” discussion only, meaning the committee took no formal action on the bill. A final decision about whether the state will again allocate money for after-school programs will be made when lawmakers pass the final omnibus appropriations bill at the end of May.

Shelley Moore Capito. (Getty Images)At least some workers at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health are getting back to work this week after federal cuts in early April took them off the job, according to a statement released Tuesday by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.
Those returning to work include some employees from the Coal Worker Health Surveillance Program and the Fire Fighters’ Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program. The total number of individuals who were granted reemployment has not been released. 
And those who are returning to work will, at this time, only be doing so temporarily. 
A Reduction In Force for the “vital” federal agency is still slated to go into effect in June and will impact these workers, according to a statement from the local chapter of the American Federation of Governmental Employees, a labor union representing the employees. 
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of AFGE Local 3430 in Morgantown, said in a news release that the union is “encouraged” by the decision to call crucial workers back to work.
“This action, though temporary, allows these dedicated professionals to return to their critical roles in advancing worker safety and health across the country,” Tinney-Zara said. “Their return means renewed momentum for life-saving research, outreach and interventions that protect workers in high-risk industries and help prevent illness, injury, and death on the job.”
Notably, Tinney-Zara continued, it seems only workers in the CWHSP and the FFFIPP — programs that are “currently in the media spotlight” — were included in the calls to return to work. That leaves numerous other programs and initiatives undertaken by NIOSH still inoperable after cuts from the new federal Department of Government Efficiency hit the agency in early April.
“These are undoubtedly vital initiatives, but they are only a portion of the comprehensive, nationwide worker protection mission NIOSH fulfills,” Tinney-Zara said. “From construction sites to health care facilities, from transportation hubs to agricultural fields, NIOSH’s work touches nearly every corner of the American labor force.”
The directive offering some people their jobs back came after Capito, earlier this month, wrote a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging him to reconsider the cuts that cost at least 200 people their jobs — and, in turn, ended the programs they worked for — in the Morgantown NIOSH facility.
On Tuesday, Capito said in a statement that she was “encouraged that some NIOSH functions for coal miner and firefighter safety are slated to resume with some select staff returning to work this week.”
“But my understanding is that this is temporary so my focus will continue to be on working with [the federal Department of Health and Human Services] on permanently restoring these functions and personnel in the most efficient and effective manner,” Capito continued.
In her letter to Kennedy on April 21, Capito emphasized how critical Morgantown’s NIOSH facility and the workers within it were to combatting deadly black lung disease and protecting miners who are now being pushed, through initiatives by the Trump Administration, to mine more coal than any time in recent memory.
“The NIOSH Mining Program works to eliminate mining fatalities and injuries. Research in rock dust has resulted in safety changes to prevent explosions in underground mines …” Capito wrote. “NIOSH’s [CWHSP] studies respiratory disease and provides black lung screenings to coal miners. It is my understanding that the RIF impacted every employee in these important programs.” 
With work by the CWHSP halted since April 1, coal miners in central Appalachia have been without access to critical health services and surveillance, including free screenings for black lung and a program that allows them, once diagnosed with black lung, to request relocating to a different, less dusty portion of a mine in order to mitigate the worst developments of the deadly disease. 
Anyone requesting to relocate in a mine — a labor right afforded to miners through the Part 90 program — must have their black lung testing results evaluated and marked eligible by a NIOSH worker in order to be approved. 
But with DOGE’s cuts, those workers didn’t exist anymore.
The reduction in services for coal miners comes as a surge of black lung disease is hitting the workforce. It also hits as implementation of a federal rule that would limit miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust for the first time ever has been delayed.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners in central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
And the resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before. This is due to miners, because of a lack of easily accessible coal, being forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone than their predecessors in order to reach what little coal remains.
When the silica dust rule was slated to go into effect this month, the former secretary for the federal Department of Labor estimated that it could potentially save thousands of lives. 
Now, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the federal Mine Health and Safety Administration — the agency that would be in charge of enacting and enforcing the silica rule — is being temporarily headed by an attorney who worked with industry groups that lobbied against implementation of exposure limits for silica, which advocates and coal mining veterans have colored as being life saving if ever implemented.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.
Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) WARREN COUNTY — Tom Vilsack, former Iowa governor and the U.S. secretary of agriculture during the Obama and Biden administrations, spoke Tuesday with farmers and rural Iowans about his ideas to grow rural communities. 
In the pine-paneled Middleswart Lodge, looking out over Lake Ahquabi State Park, Vilsack explained policies he started, and hoped would continue, that make a farm — rather than a farmer — work harder.  
This means programs like the Climate Smart commodities program, which pays farmers a premium for using sustainable agriculture tools, or practices that make use of other farm products, like an anaerobic digester that turns animal waste into renewable energy and a check for the farmer
“You could combine the marketplace and the private sector and government to do right by the environment and to do right by the small and mid-sized (farms),” Vilsack said. “The farm would work harder, not the farmer.” 
Don and Mary Mitchell, Warren County farmers who attended the program, said they had “never thought” of some of the ideas Vilsack mentioned.
As farmers in their later years, the Mitchells said they wouldn’t implement those strategies today, but would have benefited from such options earlier in their lives. 
“We might have saved a lot of miles driving back and forth from our place to Des Moines,” Mary Mitchell said with a laugh. 
Don Mitchell was a farmer that had to “work harder” to keep his family afloat when the small family farm wasn’t enough. For him, that meant commuting to Des Moines for an off-farm job for many years. 
U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics show that the majority of farmers in the U.S. have off-farm income and small farms depend on non-farming income to survive.
Vilsack said he realized after his first stint as agriculture secretary that the system was set for farmers to either “get big or get out” which has led to a loss in the number of farms and dwindling rural communities.

Vilsack said he’s not “bashing the big guys” but said he wanted to try and find a way to make it so small and mid-sized farms could also make it. He said the same solutions would also create a circular, rather than extractive, ag economy and support rural communities. 
“So now you not only have more prosperous farms, you also have more jobs, you have more reasons for people to stay in that small town,” Vilsack said. 
Vilsack said some of these programs have been kept by the current administration though they might live under a different name. 
“There’s just an enormous opportunity here if our leaders understand that we need a creative option,” Vilsack said. “This is not a situation where it’s this as opposed to something — it’s this in addition to something.” 
The Trump administration has cancelled Biden-era ag programs like the partnerships for Climate Smart commodities and a program that allowed schools to purchase food from local farmers. Other programs, like the Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, have been restructured to better align with the Trump agenda. 
 Vilsack said there’s also an opportunity for the state, counties, cities, or philanthropic groups to step in when a federal program is cancelled.  Even if it doesn’t do as much as a federal program, it sends a message.
“The key here is to understand the significance of doing something, and then having the state officials understand and appreciate and communicate to federal officials,” Vilsack said. “That’s how you can change and impact and affect policy.”
While the event was the start of a series of forums organized by the Iowa Democratic Party to highlight its plans to “grow Iowa,” Vilsack said he spoke in his capacity as an Iowan, not a politician. 
“This is not about any political stance that I may have,” Vilsack said. “It is about my deep concern about our state and my deep, deep concern about the state of rural America.” 
Vilsack said he sees a way forward, and it might as well start in Iowa.
“It doesn’t necessarily have to cost a lot of money, but it is a partnership between the government, farmers, universities, food companies, energy companies, utilities, conservation groups, environmental groups — it can bring all of this together instead of this, us or them kind of thing that we’ve got going on.” 
Iowa Democrats plan to hold similar forums, with other speakers, in different areas of the state, but have not yet released a schedule.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The U.S. House of Representatives took the initial step on Tuesday to revoke a National Park Service rule that put restrictions on motorized vehicles in sections of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.
It’s the latest in nearly two decades of controversy and legal challenges involving off-roaders, environmental groups and the National Park Service in the 1.25-million acre recreation area that encompasses Lake Powell.   
Sponsored by Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy, the resolution would overturn a National Park Service rule finalized earlier this year that restricts off-highway vehicles, like dirtbikes or ATVs, from driving on a handful of roads in Glen Canyon. 
It’s a simple resolution, stating that the rule “shall have no force or effect.” It invokes the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to review and overturn federal rules. 
The resolution cleared the House on Tuesday. It will still require approval from the Senate. 

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 
The rule only covers about 25 roads that amount to 26 miles inside the recreation area, according to Maloy’s office, which is roughly 6% of all the roads inside Glen Canyon’s borders. And those roads would still be accessible by conventional vehicles, like trucks, SUVs or Jeeps — just ATVs, side-by-sides, dirtbikes and other off-highway vehicles would be restricted. 
Environmental groups say the rule is so niche that it’s a waste of Congress’ time. Plus, the small region covered by the rule is the recreation area’s most remote and pristine, and opening them up to smaller, more advanced vehicles risks further damage to the environment. 
“They’re just closed to vehicles that have the ability to travel off road and cause severe damage,” said Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, during the House floor debate on Tuesday. 
But Maloy, along with motorized recreation advocates, say those roads allow for greater access to adjacent federally-controlled public land. The federal government didn’t consult the state or locals before finalizing the rule, she said — and even though the scope of the rule is small, Maloy argued it could hurt local economies. 
“I’ve spent a lot of time on the ground in these areas with local elected officials,” she said Tuesday. “This goes in the wrong direction. Wayne and Garfield counties are counties that struggle in a state that otherwise thrives.”

Formed in 1972, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is a stretch of public land managed by the National Park Service that spills over into northern Arizona and borders multiple national parks and monuments, including Bears Ears, Capitol Reef and Canyonlands. The region sees millions of visitors each year, often drawn to Lake Powell, the country’s second-largest reservoir. In 2025, the National Park Service recorded more than 4.7 million recreation visits to Glen Canyon. 
For years, controversy has simmered in Glen Canyon over motorized access. In 2005, environmental groups sued the National Parks Service over its loose regulation of off-road vehicles. The service settled in 2008 and agreed to develop an off-road vehicle management plan. 
In 2021, the park service, under the first Trump administration, released a new plan opening up much of the recreation area to all kinds of motorized use. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance sued two years later, arguing the administration’s plan failed to take all of the environmental impacts into consideration — the National Park Service again settled, agreeing to close the Lake Powell shoreline to motorized use, unless water levels were “sustainable” and put restrictions on ATV and side-by-side use in certain areas. 
That rule was finalized in January, affecting a small portion of the recreation area. It would prevent off-road vehicles and ATVs on segments of the Poison Spring Loop and a section of the Flint Trail, remote and challenging, yet popular, motorized routes in the recreation area. About 4,930 acres of shoreline were also covered. 
Hanna Larsen, a staff attorney for the alliance, accused the House of undermining the park service and bowing to “extreme motorized recreation in some of the most remote and wild parts of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.” 
“Rather than protect America’s crown jewels, the House has made it much more likely that treasured places such as the Orange Cliffs, Gunsight Butte, and Canyonlands National Park’s Maze District will be permanently impaired by noisy, destructive off-highway vehicles,” Larsen said in a statement. 
Proponents of the resolution include local politicians and motorized advocacy groups like the Blue Ribbon Coalition, which appealed the rule. On Tuesday, the coalition’s executive director Ben Burr said the vote represents “a grand reopening of our public lands.”
“The trails in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area that were closed through a questionable legal settlement provide unique recreation access to the Poison Spring trails and to Lake Powell,” he said. “We look forward to the Senate passing its version of this resolution, so that the American people can continue enjoying these trails for generations to come.”

Chris Elliot, R-Josephine, chair of the Senate County and Municipal Government Committee, listens to testimony on HB 67, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, which would ban drag performances in public libraries, on April 29, 2025 in Montgomery, Ala. (Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate committee Tuesday approved a bill that prohibits public libraries from presenting or sponsoring drag performances in the presence of minors without parental consent. 
As initially filed, HB 67, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, would have prohibited such performances in public libraries as well as K-12 schools. After concerns that the bill could impact school theater productions — with one high school switching a planned “Peter and the Starcatcher” production to avoid conflict with the potential bill  — the bill was amended to prohibit drag performances only in public libraries and libraries in public K-12 schools.
“What the amendment does is limit the effectiveness of this bill to where the problem is occurring … it just it talks about libraries instead of K-12 institutions, and I think that will solve, broadly, our theater program problems in all K-12 schools,” Sen. Chris Elliot, R-Josephine, the chair of the Senate County and Municipal Government Committee, which approved the bill. Elliott did not say where libraries are hosting drag performances.

Several people spoke against the bill in a public hearing and criticized its definition of drag performances as “a performance in which a performer exhibits a sex identity that is different from the sex assigned to the performer at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers.”
Opponents said that was an excessively broad definition. 
Zephyr Scalzetti, a transgender man from Huntsville, asked if the clothes he wears would be considered drag under the bill’s definition. Pointing to the “What is a Woman Act,” Scalzetti asked if he should wear a dress to his local library.
“Where is the line between what I’m wearing today and drag? Is my beard drag, since it’s a male physical marker, the very hair that grows out of my face? The answer to that question in this bill is left entirely up to libraries to determine individually,” Scalzetti said.
Opponents also raised potential legal challenges related to First Amendment rights and equal protection, with some arguing that similar laws have been deemed unconstitutional in the past.
“Whether you call this a drag ban, a crossdressing ban, a masquerade law or a three article rule, courts have ruled these laws unconstitutional for 50 years,” said Opelika resident Chris Hathcock.
Ted Halley, who said he “detransitioned” back to male after 12 years of identifying as a woman, claimed that “drag shows are grooming children to be transgender” and incentivize children to transition. Halley did not say whether a drag queen incentivized him to identify as a woman.
“Drag queen story hour, whether it’s in school, which I think you should put it back in, or a library, is very dangerous,” Halley claimed.
Detransition and regret are different concepts, a Harvard Medical School study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism suggests, which may overlap in some people, but they are “sometimes mistakenly viewed as synonymous.”
Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove, asked how consent would be obtained and in what situations it would be required. She said that she hosts events for seniors and her sorority in the Bessemer Public Library, and they may bring children with them to some events that could potentially be in conflict with the bill.
“It’s a public library. There can be minors, and a lot of my seniors take care of their grandchildren. They may bring them to the event with them,” Coleman said, adding that it’s the same case with some sorority events.
Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, said the legislation is a “cultural distraction” that distracts from more pressing concerns. He said that he is “absolutely concerned” with lawmakers not “paying attention to the fact that we are not living– we are not living in normal times.” He said that parents should be deciding what events their children attend.
“Here we are talking about what parents can decide and attempting to codify this into law. I am embarrassed by this … That is shameful. That is not what our government should be doing,” Hatcher said.
The bill goes to the full Senate for consideration.

The Crawford County Quorum Court voted unanimously Monday night at a special meeting to accept the library’s governing board’s offer to pay […],"The ""social section"" in Crawford County Library's Van Buren branch (Screenshot from court documents)A West Arkansas public library system will pay its home county’s legal fees in a case the county lost last year over the location of certain LGBTQ+ materials in all five library branches.
The Crawford County Quorum Court voted unanimously Monday night at a special meeting to accept the library’s governing board’s offer to pay nearly $113,000, which U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks declared the defendants in the suit must pay.
Three mothers whose children are library patrons sued the Crawford County Library System in May 2023 over its segregation of children’s books with LGBTQ+ themes into “social sections.” This was a “compromise” in light of public outcry over the books being on the shelves at all, said Deidre Grzymala, the former library director who resigned in February 2023.
Plaintiffs Rebecka Virden, Nina Prater and Samantha Rowlett alleged in their suit that the “social sections” were based on “an extreme and malevolent view of the Bible” and violated the First Amendment.
The lawsuit’s five defendants are the county, the county judge, the quorum court, the library board and the library’s current director, Charlene McDonnough, who took over the role in January 2024.
U.S. District Judge P.K. Holmes ruled in the plaintiffs’ favor in September and ordered the library to return the segregated books to their original sections. The case was reassigned to Brooks in October.
The projected legal cost was around $118,000, but the cost was reduced by $5,000 after Brooks did not grant any motions from the plaintiffs or defendants after the ruling.
Crawford County and County Judge Chris Keith were also defendants in a separate lawsuit against the state over Act 372 of 2023, which would have given local elected officials the final say over whether to relocate challenged library materials some consider “obscene.” The 18 plaintiffs, including Crawford County Library patrons, cited county officials’ statements that Act 372 was a reason to maintain the “social sections.”
Brooks enjoined the challenged portions of Act 372, citing First Amendment violations, in December. The legal fees facing Crawford County defendants in both lawsuits now exceed $575,000, library board chairman Keith Pigg said.
Federal judge declares sections of Arkansas’ library obscenity law unconstitutional

 Ongoing conflict

Before Brooks’ April 16 order for the defendants to foot the bill for the Crawford County-specific lawsuit, the quorum court and the library board had already squabbled for months over whether the county or the library was responsible for the payment. Members of the library board appointed by the current quorum court supported paying the bill with library operating funds.
On Wednesday, the board voted 3-1 to authorize the payment with library funds as a gesture of “good will” toward the quorum court, which took the board up on the offer Monday.
Pigg did not vote on the motion, and he urged the quorum court on Monday not to approve it.
Pigg is the only current board member remaining from before Crawford County citizens began complaining to the quorum court about LGBTQ+ books in the library in late 2022. Jeffrey and Tammi Hamby of Van Buren co-wrote a December 2022 letter to Crawford County pastors, saying LGBTQ+ content within children’s reach is “grooming a generation of children to feel this is normal and an accepted way of life.”
Pigg reminded the quorum court Monday that, while a majority of the library board approved the $113,000 payment, the board did not approve the use of roughly $40,000 in library funds to pay Grzymala’s severance package after she resigned. Both state law and the state Constitution prohibit local elected officials from using library funds without the library board’s consent.
Pigg said the library system’s services would suffer if it were forced to pay the legal fees. 
In an interview Tuesday, McDonnough agreed, saying the library’s budget is “already set for 2025,” but that the system would likely have to reduce its hours at some branches and purchase fewer books in early 2026.

Another payment demand
At an April 18 library board meeting, member Tammi Hamby blamed the lawsuit on Grzymala and accused her of dishonesty. Grzymala’s attorney, Christopher Hooks, responded with an April 23 letter to the county seeking $100,000 in damages over the remarks. Hooks said Hamby violated the county’s “separation agreement” with Grzymala upon her resignation, which stated that Grzymala and the county would refrain from “criticizing, denigrating or disparaging each other.”
The quorum court appointed Hamby and two others to the library board in early 2023 to succeed three members who resigned en masse. All three board members now in those positions voted in favor of the library paying the legal fees stemmng from the lawsuit.
McDonnough told the Advocate in December that Crawford County residents had not been publicly decrying library content since Holmes’ September ruling against the county.
On Monday, some residents revived those complaints before the quorum court. Mike Rich blamed the lawsuit on “the LGBT group and their liberal allies” who “sued to force exposure” of objectionable content to minors.

Challenges to public library funding throughout Arkansas meet frustration, some resistance

 

“The library is now a compromised, dangerous institution,” Rich said.
Other citizens disputed this claim and urged the quorum court to reject the library board’s payment offer, saying the parties that lost the case should have to pay for it.
Rich said he hopes Crawford County will see a future ballot measure to defund the library. Several counties throughout the state have seen attempts to reduce the tax millage that funds their libraries, to varying degrees of success. Some of those counties have experienced public clashes over children’s access to LGBTQ+ books, including in Craighead County, which narrowly lost half its library tax funding in 2022. An effort to restore the millage failed last year.
McDonnough said she has faith in Crawford County libraries to stay afloat despite the turmoil.
“Our libraries are strong and resilient, and this is just a bump in the road that we will conquer,” McDonnough said.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — New academic standards proposed for social studies and science are expected to take effect after state lawmakers took no action Tuesday on resolutions to reject them.
Republican majorities in the state House and Senate held a vote on none of the three resolutions that would send the proposed standards back to the Oklahoma State Board of Education for further review. Agendas for Tuesday’s legislative proceedings didn’t include any of the resolutions.
That left less than the constitutionally required minimum time for the Legislature to pass a measure through both chambers before a deadline Thursday to take action on the standards. Lawmakers have had 30 legislative days to pass a resolution to accept, reject or amend the standards, but by taking no action, they allow the proposed draft to take effect as written.

Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, worked with Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, to file a resolution Thursday to reject the standards for social studies and science, but there wasn’t enough GOP support to pass it, Paxton’s spokesperson, Alex Gerszewski, said in a statement Tuesday. 
The Senate Republican Caucus discussed the matter in a private meeting with Walters.
“Following a lengthy conversation Monday, the caucus was not on board with rejecting the standards based on the process in which they were presented to the (state) board of education,” Gerszewski said.
Offices of the House speaker and the governor did not immediately return requests for comment.
House and Senate Democrats filed their own resolutions March 31 to reject the social studies standards.
Gov. Kevin Stitt and members of the state Board of Education have raised transparency concerns with the way state Superintendent Ryan Walters handled the adoption process.
Half of the state board said they were unaware of last-minute changes made to the social studies standards at the time they voted on them during a Feb. 27 meeting. 
Some of the changes include the addition of language stating there were “discrepancies” in 2020 election results including “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”

Walters and his staff made no mention during the Feb. 27 meeting of any significant differences from the original draft posted publicly in December. The Oklahoma State Department of Education didn’t share the updated version online until weeks after the board vote.
Board members received the final draft of the standards at 4 p.m. the day before a 9:30 a.m. meeting to vote on the proposal, according to email records from the state Education Department. One member, Ryan Deatherage, said before casting the only vote against the standards that he didn’t have enough time to read through the lengthy document.
Pugh’s resolution in the Senate, which seven House members co-signed, offered to send the standards back to the state board for “proper review and consideration” given the “magnitude of the decision,” doubts over transparency and an estimated $33 million price tag to implement them.
Academic standards are a list of topics and concepts that public schools must teach to students. They are reviewed and updated every six years.
State standards are typically developed with committees of Oklahoma educators and subject-matter experts. For the social studies standards, Walters also chose to involve national right-wing media personalities and conservative policy advocates in a leading review committee.
Walters said he decided to add new language to the standards after his administration received input from the public and from focus groups. He said the new content wasn’t intended to support or deny the results of the 2020 presidential election, but rather to encourage students to draw their own conclusions. 
  Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said Republicans have permitted academic standards that are “dangerous for kids.” (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, called Walters’ new standards “dangerous for kids.” She said her Republican colleagues have failed to take the matter as seriously as they should by taking up neither resolution filed in the Senate to reject the standards.
“Our classrooms will be focused on these politicized measures that have been written by political hacks from outside of our state, and if we’re not concerned enough to put that on the agenda and take a vote on it, that deeply disturbs me about the business of the Senate,” Kirt told reporters Tuesday.
In response, Senate Democrats will “take time on bills” and slow down floor votes, she said. Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, began filibustering shortly before noon. Republicans quickly ended the floor session and called for a lunch recess.
House Minority Leader and candidate for governor Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, expressed similar outrage at the lack of action by Republican leadership. Political pressure from Walters, she said, mattered more than the “extremist political agenda” the standards will introduce into public schools.
“Because no action has been taken by Republican legislative leaders, the voices of Oklahomans — across the state and party lines — who have been urging us to disapprove these problematic, and costly, social studies standards have gone unheard,” Munson said in a statement.
Several local GOP party officials and far-right-wing groups, including Moms for Liberty Oklahoma, signed a letter to lawmakers supporting Walters’ proposal as “strong, conservative, pro-American standards.” The letter, dated Monday, urged legislators to oppose Pugh’s resolution to reject.
“We want to remind every legislator: In the last few election cycles, grassroots conservative organizations have flipped seats across Oklahoma by holding weak Republicans accountable,” the letter reads. “If you choose to side with the liberal media and make backroom deals with Democrats to block conservative reform, you will be next.”

The Missouri Senate on Tuesday night will start debating 13 spending bills to fund state government operations in the coming year. The bills would appropriate $49.4 billion — $1.5 billion more than the proposal approved in the Missouri House and $700 million less than proposed by Gov. Mike Kehoe in January.
The Senate plan includes several new big-ticket items added in committee work, including $300 million more for public schools through the foundation formula, $107 million more for child care subsidy payments and $92.7 million to pay a software firm that won a judgment over claims it was not paid for work it completed.
But the biggest source of new spending in the Senate budget plan is 169 line items for favored projects and programs. The $441 million in earmarks  — including $332.5 million in general revenue — range in size from $36,000 for the Kansas City Police Department to implement “crime prevention through environmental design training” to $37.9 million from federal funds for the Missouri Office of Refugee Administration, an independent office of the not-for-profit International Institute of St. Louis that was created in 2018.
The House had its own batch of earmarks, 105 in the operating budget plus 44 more in the capital appropriations bills, totaling $295 million. Of those, 57 — totaling $126.3 million, including $115 million in general revenue — were cut in the Senate. A dozen items were increased by a total of $7 million.
There are two earmarks especially important to the top budget writers in each chamber. 
Last year, lawmakers agreed to spend $8 million to renovate a historic footbridge on Jefferson Avenue in Springfield, in the district of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, and $12.5 million to purchase 1,800 acres in McDonald County, in the district of House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton of Noel.
Then-Gov. Mike Parson approved the footbridge and vetoed the state park. Deaton put the park back into the budget at $19 million for 1,600 acres and cut funding for the footbridge. Hough cut the park funding and restored money for the footbridge.
The total of new earmarks from the two chambers, 318 so far, is the largest number of such items included in a budget plan as the state built an enormous budget surplus during Parson’s second term.
The number represents only new items not included in Kehoe’s budget that are identifiable for a single community or vendor. Many of the hundreds of earmarks added in the final years of Parson’s administration are not included in budget tracking by The Independent.
“We’ll just sit down with the guys in the House and see where their top top priorities are,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican, said when asked how many he expects to keep in the final budget. “I don’t put things in the budget on the Senate side that I don’t then go to conference and fight for.”
 House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, speaks March 3 during debate on the fiscal 2025 supplemental appropriations bill (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Deaton said he will be working toward a fixed total for spending and every item approved will have to stay within that amount.
“I’ve never known of a budget year where you end up where everybody’s universally well pleased and happy,” Deaton said. “So it’s not just a question of what we can do this year. We’ve got to make sure we’re thinking about next year and the trajectory of the state budget.”
After the Senate votes on the operating budget bills, the Senate Appropriations Committee must work on its version of the two capital spending bills, plus the bill reappropriating funds received from the American Rescue Plan Act.
Kehoe recommended $954 million for the capital bills and $2.7 billion for the reappropriation measure. The House boosted the capital bills to $1.03 billion and trimmed about $100 million from the reappropriation bill.
Lawmakers have until May 9 to finish work on the budget. 
 Revenue picture

The full list of earmarks added to the budget in either chamber, if approved for the final budget package, would cost $736.4 million, including $597.8 million in general revenue.
With a historically high fund balance — the general revenue fund balance on March 31 was $3.7 billion, with another $1.5 billion in funds that can be spent like general revenue — paying for those items is not a question.
But with the House pushing for a tax cut on capital gains income, revenues lagging behind estimates and uncertainty for federal matching funds in programs like Medicaid, the question is how long the surplus will last.
“Right now is the time to get it in, because I don’t think in the next few years we’re going to have the revenue or the federal dollars,” said state Rep. Adrian Plank, a Columbia Democrat who can claim credit for three earmarks in his district to help small towns with wastewater and flooding issues.
Kehoe proposed using almost $16 billion in general revenue in the coming year for operations and capital needs. The plan approved in the House uses $15.2 billion. The Senate operating budget calls for $15.7 billion in general revenue spending with the total for capital needs yet to be set.
All three versions of the budget would require a substantial amount of surplus funds to supplement current revenue. 
The consensus revenue estimate issued in December forecast that the state will take in $13.56 billion during the fiscal year that starts July 1. The estimate also forecast that revenues in the current year would be $13.35 billion.
Both predictions may be hard to meet. Through April 22, the last date available, state revenues are down 1.65% for the year, a trend that would realize only $13.2 billion in revenue and, based on the forecast growth rate, $13.4 billion in the coming fiscal year.
 State Rep. Del Taylor, a St. Louis Democrat, is surrounded by other members of the Democratic caucus as an April 3 news conference about the Missouri state budget (Rudi Keller/Missouri Indepenent).
State Sen. Adam Schnelting, a St. Charles Republican who saw a small tax cut bill he sponsored for National Guard soldiers balloon to a $1.7 billion general tax cut in a House committee, said the urge to cut taxes should be accompanied by reduced spending.
“There’s always so many different pet projects, and I know sometimes that there are legitimate needs and concerns, that’s part of the process,” Schnelting said. “But the bottom line is, we just have to start cutting. That’s what my own caucus has to understand — long term, we have to ensure that with our tax cuts, we also cut the size of government.”
If Missouri has a strong economy, revenues should allow for lawmakers to insert local priorities into the budget, said state Rep. Del Taylor, a St. Louis Democrat who sits on the House Budget Committee. Legislators are elected to take care of constituent needs, he said.
“That is the job of the House of Representatives, to bring forward those types of projects,” Taylor said.
Funding big items like the increase for the school foundation formula and earmark projects can be done responsibly, Hough said.
“We’re not spending everything we have in the bank waiting on the next round of income tax and corporate tax and everything else to come into the state coffers to make sure we’re OK for next year,” Hough said. “We’re still carrying over more money this fiscal year to next fiscal year than we ever used to when I was in the House.”
 Earmark transparency

Each earmark added to the budget is identifiable because it has language directing it to a particular place, usually defined by population or political status, or organization, using language that only identifies one possible recipient.
The footbridge, for example, is identified as being “approximately five hundred sixty-two feet long” and located in a city that can only be Springfield. The refugee support funding is intended for an “a non-profit organization established in 2018.”
And, with work, most can be assigned to a legislative district. But none are publicly identified with the name of the legislator requesting the funds, or if it is added at the urging of a state institution like a university or a lobbyist for a private concern.
For the most part, lawmakers like it that way.
“As a member of the minority party, oftentimes I get my things done when a member of the majority is willing to do it, or when the chairman is willing to do it himself,” said state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “And I know that sometimes there’s a motivation for Democrats to not have public wins.”
House Majority Leader Alex Riley, a Republican from Springfield, said lawmakers who secure money for local projects are rarely reluctant to make it known.
“What we see in practice is when you have members that bring home something for their district that they’re proud of, most of the time those members will talk about that publicly,” Riley said. “That’s not usually something that they hide from.”
In the House, a three-step budget process, with subcommittees making recommendations in specialized areas, followed by the full House Budget Committee and floor action, there is somewhat more transparency.
For example, Taylor asked for the three water projects, costing $1.9 million total in Plank’s district in a subcommittee meeting and said he was doing so on Plank’s behalf. The subcommittee recommendation was not adopted by the full committee, but they are included in the Senate budget plan.
Plank wasn’t aware that the $1 million for sewer upgrades in Harrisburg, the $500,000 for stormwater control in Sturgeon and $400,000 for a floodwall in Rocheport were in the Senate plan.
“I’ve got the most rural district of any Democrat in the state, so when they have issues, they can’t grow, and they have issues that we can solve that will make them grow,” Plank said. “At that point, it doesn’t matter what party you represent, it’s about supporting your communities.”
Both Sturgeon and Harrisburg are about the same size they were in 1980, while Rocheport has lost 25% of its population. During that time, Boone County has grown in population by more than 80%.
One of the few earmarks directly sponsored into the budget by a floor amendment would use $900,000 of general revenue for a road project at Missouri Route 185 and Strange Drive in Washington County. State Rep. Mike McGirl, a Republican from Potosi, had to first win a $900,000 cut to prescription costs in the Medicaid program to finance his road project.
It was cut in the Senate.
The location where the work will be done is a dangerous dip in the road, he said. And he hopes to get the money back from the conference committee.
“That’s not the final product yet,” McGirl said. “There’s going to have to be some negotiations in there.”
McGirl’s fight for his amendment is the exception. Most items added in the House, and all items added in the Senate, were done by committee chairmen fulfilling requests made to them in private.
During the session, their offices are generally the busiest with visitors seeking favors.
Hough said he sees no reason to change the system.
“Folks do a pretty good job of keeping tabs on what they’re following and what they’re trying to accomplish,” Hough said. “And for the most part, when this all gets done, they go and say, ‘look what I did.’”

It’s crucial for the Michigan economy. It’s crucial for the men and women here for our homeland security and our future,” Whitmer said.
In a later press release, Whitmer said the new fighter mission would grow Michigan’s economy while keeping expert talent including pilots and maintenance workers in the state and cement Michigan’s leadership in national security for decades to come.  
“This is a huge, bipartisan win for Michigan, decades in the making, that will grow our economy and make our country safer,” Whitmer said in the release. “Because of our tireless work with partners on the ground in Macomb County and on both sides of the aisle, the future of Selfridge is bright, lasting, and secure. I’ll keep working with anyone to get things done on the kitchen-table issues and make a real difference for Michigan families.” 
Trump thanked Whitmer for her efforts at keeping Selfridge open as an active duty base. 
“So I want to thank Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for bringing [Selfridge] to our attention,” Trump said. “I’m not supposed to do that. She’s a Democrat. They say, ‘Don’t do that. Don’t have her here.’ I said, no, she’s going to be here. She’s done a very good job, frankly, and she was very much involved with the Republicans. They worked together on saving it. And it was not easy. So I want to thank you very much, Gretchen. Good job.”
Earlier this month, Whitmer joined Trump in the Oval Office as an “honored” guest as he signed an executive order to address the issue of invasive Asian Carp in the Great Lakes, saying Whitmer is a “very good person” who has done “an excellent job” in Michigan.
The new F-15s at Selfridge will replace the aging A-10 Thunderbolt II squadron scheduled to be retired next year. Without a defined squadron, the base had faced possible closure, with an ensuing loss of jobs and economic development for the region. 
“It’s a key piece of our statewide defense strategy and foundational to Macomb’s and Southeast Michigan’s economy,” said U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Paul D. Rogers, adjutant general and director of the Michigan Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. 
“This new fighter mission prevents the loss of about $30 million in wages. We’re excited for the future at Selfridge and for the future missions that will unfold while employing this great multirole fighter,” Rogers said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-29-184914-1024x597.png,,,2025-04-29 19:08:18.492906

(Photo by Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)More than 25,000 children in Oregon and Washington will lose the child care and early education their families rely on if the Trump administration continues its attempts to dismantle Head Start, say northwest nonprofit organizations that signed onto a lawsuit against the administration.
For the past 60 years, the federal Head Start program has provided child care and early learning opportunities to low-income children, many of whom are from non-white families or speak languages other than English.
But since President Donald Trump returned to office, the U.S. Department of Health Human Services has informed Head Start agencies they can’t use any federal funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and abruptly closed half of its regional offices, including the Seattle office that supported programs in Washington and Oregon.
Earlier this month, the Associated Press obtained a memo from the federal Office of Management and Budget calling for eliminating the Head Start program, as well as programs for teen pregnancy and Lyme disease.
All of that led Family Forward Oregon and the Washington State Association of Head Start and Early Childhood Assistance and Education Program to join Head Start associations from Illinois, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and a parents group from Oakland, California, in suing the Health and Human Services Department, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal officials to prevent cuts.
“Over the last three months, Donald Trump has put a bullseye on the backs of 3- and 4-year-olds,” Joel Ryan, executive director of the Washington program, said during a Tuesday press call. “He’s done everything to disrupt, dismantle and eventually paralyze the Head Start program.”
In Washington, that included a Head Start agency shutting down temporarily earlier this month when it didn’t receive federal funding, depriving more than 400 families of child care and 70 workers of their jobs. That child care center in Sunnyside eventually reopened.
More than 14,300 Washington children and more than 12,000 Oregon children receive services through Head Start.
Candice Vickers, the executive director of Family Forward Oregon, is a Head Start alumna. Her nonprofit organization, with members including mothers, caregivers and child care providers, advocates for child care at the state Legislature and with the federal government.
In recent months, Vickers said she has heard from a single mom of three in Portland who expects to lose her job if she loses access to Head Start because she can’t afford child care on her own. From families in Corvallis who learned last week that their Early Head Start program, which serves infants, was shut down with no reopen date. And from a mother in rural Oregon who credited Head Start for helping her recover from addiction and teaching her daughter to love reading.
“Head Start is more than just a preschool program,” Vickers said. “It’s a lifeline for working parents. It provides kids with the tools they need to succeed in school. It offers meals, dental care, mental health support and resources for these important parents.”
Oregon already has a severe child care shortage: A report prepared for the state’s Early Learning Division in 2023 found that nearly all counties are child care deserts, with one slot for every three children who need care. Without access to regulated child care, parents may have to give up work or rely on an unstable patchwork of caregivers, and businesses have a harder time recruiting employees.
Losing Head Start would have ripple effects through the rest of the economy, Vickers said.
“Once you’re fired from your job for not having access to childcare, you’re not going to get that job back,” she said. “These things that are happening won’t be able to be fixed by changing our mind tomorrow.”
U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said cuts to Head Start threaten years of progress toward making child care more available and affordable to families. Murray, who chaired the Senate Appropriations Committee when Democrats last controlled the chamber, negotiated an additional $1 billion for child care and early education as part of a $1.2 trillion spending package last year. That included a $275 million increase for Head Start.
“A couple of billionaires with no idea about what they are doing came along and decided to take an ax to Head Start,” Murray said. “Talk about clueless. Talk about careless. Instead of giving our kids a head start, Trump and Musk want to give billionaires another tax break and give families the cold shoulder.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 22:49:02+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge Eliot Prescott selected as next CT Inspector General,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/judge-eliot-prescott-ct-inspector-general/,"Eliot Prescott, a judge for the CT Appellate Court, will be the next CT Inspector General, charged with investigating fatal police shootings.","Connecticut’s Criminal Justice Commission voted Tuesday to appoint Judge Eliot Prescott to be the state’s next inspector general, tasked with investigating when people die in custody and deciding if police officers should be criminally charged for killing people while in the line of duty.
The commission spent nearly all day Tuesday interviewing five finalists for the position before selecting Prescott for the job. 
Prescott, who is currently serving as a senior judge for the Connecticut Appellate Court, beat out an experienced field of candidates with extensive histories as prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges. 
The other four finalists who were interviewed included Leonard Crone, a defense attorney from Waterbury; State Superior Court Judge Kevin Randolph; Superior Court Judge Kevin Russo; and Herman Woodard Jr., a defense attorney from Windsor. 
The lengthy interview process is evidence of the weight placed on the inspector general’s office, which was created by state lawmakers in 2020 to make the process of investigating police shootings more transparent and independent.
Prescott called the 2020 bill that created the inspector general’s office a “critical and wise piece of legislation.”
But the questions posed by members of the criminal justice commission highlighted how difficult the job will be for Prescott as he takes over the role from Robert Devlin, who served as the first inspector general in the state’s history. 
Supreme Court Justice Andrew McDonald, who chairs the commission, warned each candidate that there were more than 20 pending investigations into police shootings and prison deaths that would need to be resolved by the next inspector general.

“If you take this role, you would essentially be jumping onto a moving train,” McDonald said. 
The commissioners also warned Prescott and the other finalists that the role of inspector general was a “difficult and thankless” position. 
The duties of the office often place the inspector general directly between law enforcement officers and the family members of people who are killed by police. 
After reviewing body camera footage and interviewing officers and other witnesses, the inspector general decides whether a police officer was justified in killing someone or whether they should be criminally charged for their actions.
Devlin, who will retire at the end of June, reviewed dozens of cases of police shootings and prison deaths during his tenure as inspector general, producing detailed reports about each case.

And he used his powers to bring criminal charges against one officer, State Trooper Brian North, who shot and killed 19-year-old Mubarak Soulemane in 2020. 
North was acquitted by a jury after a week-long criminal trial, but the case still created animosity toward the inspector general’s office from police officers and their unions. And that tension seems to have continued.
Scott Murphy, another member of the criminal justice commission, said one union official recently sent a letter to the commission raising concerns that the next inspector general would open “witch hunts” against police officers in the state. 
The commissioners asked Prescott whether he would be able to fairly perform the job while facing public pressure from both police and members of the community who believe individual officers should be charged for their actions.
They also peppered him with questions about whether he’d ever handled a trial where media was in the courtroom. They asked whether he believed in systemic racism. They probed what he would do in situations when police officers didn’t turn on their body cameras during a shooting. And they asked how he would build trust in communities with significant distrust in the legal and criminal justice systems
Prescott told the commission that he was ready to assume the role and all of the pressures that came with it. And he said his experience as a judge had prepared him to make difficult and, sometimes, unpopular decisions.
“I’ve made unpopular decisions on the bench,” said Prescott, who cited an court order in 2013 that released the 911 calls from the Sandy Hook school shooting.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0429_SR_InspectorGeneral_090-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 19:08:18.492906

(Elise Plunk, Louisiana Illuminator)Debate over local control and state regulation of emissions took on David vs. Goliath tones Tuesday at the State Capitol, where a legislative committee considered a raft of bills dealing with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS).
Some 30 CCS projects have been proposed for Louisiana that would pull carbon dioxide from industrial smokestacks and pipe it to locations where it can be stored underground. Ten carbon storage bills were on the House Committee on Natural Resources agenda. 
They included House Bill 4 by Rep. Chuck Owen, R-Rosepine, which would give all 64 parishes the right to vote on whether they would allow CCS projects within their boundaries. After hours of debate, the proposal failed in a 6-10 vote with bipartisan opposition and Republicans accounting for all the votes in favor. 
Three CCS projects are proposed for Allen and Vernon parishes within Owen’s district. In an interview after the vote, Owen said he believes the oil and gas industry is investing in the technology in response to so-called “legacy lawsuits” against their companies for damages to Louisiana’s coastal wetlands. 
A Plaquemines Parish jury awarded its local government $740 million in damages earlier this month in their lawsuit against Chevron. Freeport-McMoran reached a $100 million settlement with 12 parishes in 2019 in its legacy lawsuit. Several similar cases are pending in other parishes against Big Oil.  
“People like me – legislators and governors – created this mess, and it destroyed oil and gas,” Owen said. “It has forced oil and gas to be prostituted with (CCS).”
Support for carbon capture and sequestration in Louisiana does not fall along traditional political lines. Its proponents largely come from the oil and gas industry, who see the technology as a meaningful way to reduce the emissions tied to global warming. Opponents view the technology as an untested safety hazard and another way to promote more fossil fuel extraction. 
CCS detractors have advocated for more local control over storage projects and have butted heads with industry backers who warn that varying governing regulation among 64 parishes will have a chilling effect on economic development. 
Owen and Rep. Shane Mack, R-Livingston, argued that local control doesn’t necessarily end CCS projects but amplifies the voices of local communities.  
“Please don’t think Chuck is here trying to kill off carbon capture,” Owen told committee members. 
Rep. Danny McCormick, R-Oil City, framed his viewpoint on carbon capture with property rights in mind. He aired concerns over projects with underground storage that could expand past parish lines and noted that CO2 pipelines could have to cut through private land.
“Us here in Louisiana are pretty independent, you know, home of the free and of the brave. I think we should take into consideration private property rights,” McCormick said.
Industry representatives spoke in support of keeping carbon capture regulations minimal and managed on a statewide front, rather than allowing each parish and locality to establish its own rules.
Tommy Faucheux, Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association president, said CCS provides a “new opportunity” to “strengthen and expand” his industry in Louisiana. Interest in building such projects in Louisiana could cool at the thought of further regulation without consistency, he said.
The powerful Louisiana Association of Business and Industry also opposes House Bill 4, arguing it would add more red tape to industrial development. LABI president and CEO Will Green said there will be major economic consequences if locals are given power over whether CCS projects move forward.
“The last thing they need is more layers of government,” Green said, adding that more regulatory steps for CCS projects would be “harmful” to advancing the industry.
The state Department of Energy and Natural Resources expects to issue dozens of permits for the wells needed to store carbon dioxide underground starting later this year. Paige Carter, chief business development officer with Louisiana Economic Development, said changing the rules would not be fair to projects already in motion and cast Louisiana in a bad light to business. 
Other bills the committee considered included:
Senate Bill 73 by Sen. Mike Reese, R- Leesville, advanced without opposition. It would require the state conservation commissioner to follow CCS permitting rules similar to those in place for coastal restoration projects. Applications would give “substantial consideration” to public comment and local government input on whether a project takes place. 
 
House Bill 601 by Rep. Brett Geymann, R- Lake Charles, in a tie vote, did not advance from the committee. It would restrict the use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide storage pipelines. The principal allows a government or business entity to force the sale of private property for a use that’s considered to be for the greater good.
The House Committee on Natural Resources recessed so members could convene on the floor Tuesday afternoon. The meeting resumed after the full House adjourned, and this report will be updated with the outcome of other bills on the agenda.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250429_091231-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-04-29 19:08:18.492906

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state House narrowly passed an altered bill that requires school districts to implement “bell-to-bell” cellphone bans for the upcoming school year.
Senate Bill 139, which passed by a single vote, heads to Gov. Kevin Stitt for consideration. 
While it requires schools to ban cellphones and personal electronic devices like smart watches, tablets and smart glasses for one year, it allows districts to lift that ban in any subsequent years.
Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, said the version that heads to Stitt’s desk is different from the initial version passed by the House. The original version contained an opt out for districts that didn’t want to comply. The Senate version, which heads to Stitt’s desk, contains none.
He said the chambers compromised on a “try it before you buy it, type of policy.” Everyone will be required to try it for a year, but if a district finds the policy doesn’t work for them, and they would like students to have cellphones in class, then they can opt out moving forward, Caldwell said.
How districts implement the ban is up to them, he said.
Rep. Danny Williams, R-Seminole, said he liked the original House bill that would have allowed districts to opt out and provided local control.
“I’m not fond of the requirement because we talk a lot about local control, and it looks like we’re kind of creeping into no control on the first year of this,” he said. 
But Caldwell said the bill is consistent with other bills that the Legislature passed because it directs districts on what to do, but gives them flexibility on how to act within those parameters.
“Ultimately, I think where this goes back to is the total local control,” he said. “…After this year, (if) they’re the outlier, they’re the district that their education outcomes didn’t improve, their behavioral problems didn’t decrease, and the school board wants to take the step up and say, ‘No, we want cellphones back in our classes,’ they can do that.”
Caldwell said he hopes Stitt will sign the measure and “we’ll all celebrate next year when our kids can go to a distraction-free classroom.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM) A New Mexico district court judge on Tuesday found that the Public Education Department has not complied with previous orders in the Yazzie/Martinez education equity case and ordered the state to begin the process for creating a plan to rectify the situation.
Parties in the more than 10-year-old Yazzie/Martinez case returned to court  after plaintiffs filed a motion of non-compliance in September 2024, pointing to continued poor student outcomes, high turnover within the PED and high teacher vacancy rates.
First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson concurred and said the state needs a plan to ensure progress is made and tracked.
“A court-ordered plan would provide guidance to the Legislature and the executive branches of government, particularly when making difficult budgetary decisions that need to survive political and economic shifts,” Wilson said during the hearing.
Plaintiffs’ legal counsel had proposed appointing the Legislative Education Study Committee to lead the development of the plan because the department has permanent staff and access to educational research. However, Wilson said because the LESC is not party to the case, he does not have the authority to direct them to create a plan. Instead, PED is tasked with developing a plan and LESC can provide input. 
Wilson gave the PED until July 1 to identify an “outside expert and consultant to assist” in developing the plan and to file a status report with the court. The state then has until Oct. 1 to develop a draft report and file another status report with the state, “taking into consideration all of the components and elements raised by the plaintiffs in their briefing.” Wilson said the final plan must be completed by Nov. 3 and filed for the court’s review. 
The plaintiffs outlined a proposed plan with nine goals to address the needs of Native American students, low income students, English language learners and students with disabilities. 
A PED spokesperson told Source NM that the department welcomes Wilson’s decision. According to court documents, the PED did not object to creating a plan, but objected to the LESC taking the lead in the process.
“Improving student outcomes is central to our mission and this plan will support lasting improvements to our educational system,” the PED told Source in a written statement. The department also said the state has “substantially increased funding” and the department has made “significant steps” to improve student outcomes and teacher recruitment.
Melissa Candelaria, education director for the NM Center on Law and Poverty, which represents the plaintiffs, said plaintiffs still see the court’s decision as a “victory” because LESC will still be involved. She said the plaintiffs will be involved as well, because Wilson ordered that stakeholders be consulted.
She said the plaintiffs will need continued support “as we go forward in holding the state accountable in implementmenting the plan and ensuring that the voices are at the table in the development of the plan, as the court said just a little while ago,” Candelaria said during a news conference following the court’s decision.
Wilhelmina Yazzie (Diné), one of the original plaintiffs, was emotional following the court’s decision. 
“I think it’s about time, and I really am staying positive. As I mentioned, my boys were young when we started this, now they’re young adults,” Yazzie told Source NM.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that the current measles outbreak marks the second highest annual case count in 25 years, and more than 80% of the nearly 900 current cases are associated with the “ongoing outbreak in close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage” in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.
Overall, 96% of the cases have been among people confirmed as unvaccinated, or with unknown vaccination records.
As of Tuesday, New Mexico had 66 cases, with no new ones reported yet this week. Most of the state’s cases are in Lea County, just across the state line from Gaines County, Texas, where the outbreak began in mid-February.
From Feb. 1 to April 25, 20,304 New Mexicans received a dose of the measles vaccine statewide, nearly double the 10,860 people over the same time last year, according to the New Mexico Department of Health. The national vaccination rate has slipped from 90.8% for one dose of measles, mumps and rubella, below the 95% threshold to prevent outbreaks from spreading.
In 2000, after decades of vaccination, the CDC declared measles eliminated in the U.S., but if current vaccination rates continue, or decline further, measles may become commonplace again, according to research co-authored by Dr. Nathan Lo, an infectious diseases physician-scientist at Stanford University.
“It was striking for us, just seeing how much the U.S. was at this tipping point for measles, where small declines in vaccination can put us very certainly on the path for measles returning,” Lo told Source NM in a phone call. “But also, small increases in vaccines can push us back into safe territory.”
In research published in the academic journal JAMA last week, Lo and other researchers at Stanford used mathematical models to estimate how four serious diseases eliminated by vaccines in the U.S. (measles, rubella, polio and diphtheria) might reemerge based on vaccination rates. The models run thousands of simulations, projecting what the changes look like in the next 25 years.
A 10% decrease in people choosing to vaccinate could spur an estimated 11 million measles cases over 25 years in the U.S.
Even at the current levels of vaccination, measles could reestablish itself in the U.S. with hundreds of thousands of cases over 25 years.
“We’re still very likely on the path toward measles return, but it won’t happen for sometime,” Lo said, estimating that reemergence is about 20 years away.
The state with the highest risk of measles: Texas. This is in part due to declines in vaccination rates, but also due to its large cities with international travel and demographic features, such as the age of the population.
As for New Mexico, Lo said: “One of the risks is being next to Texas, I think that’s been made clear.”
Prevalent measles infections would mean preventable illness-related deaths, often in children, and long-term injuries such as brain damage, he said.
“There’s a number of rare but real neurologic complications that happen from measles; some of which are universally fatal and many of which lead to lifelong-disability,” he said. “Those are the really unfathomable types of outcomes we hope don’t come to pass.”
For the other childhood diseases to reemerge, there would need to be a significant drop in vaccination rates, such as a 30% to 40% decline, he said.
That’s unlikely to happen without big policy shifts from the federal government, Lo said, such as changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, reducing potency of vaccines or revoking vaccines’ uses.
“Suddenly, those scenarios of vaccine decline suggest that even rubella, polio and their really awful clinical complications such as babies born with birth defects and people living with lifelong paralysis or even dying, becomes much more of a risk,” Lo said.
Lo said he hopes that not just policy makers, but parents and people considering getting a vaccine hear about the research.
“A small fraction of the population can really make a difference here,” he said.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) The revised revenue forecast legislators have been waiting for to help drive policy and funding decisions isn’t providing much more clarity than before. It also means legislators still have a relatively small amount of money to work with this session. 
Maine’s Revenue Forecasting Committee only made minor changes to its predictions for state revenue for the next several years. However, the lack of serious revisions was not due to what’s known but rather what’s not: uncertainty with federal funding and the economy, specifically impacts from tariffs.
While the committee’s report is not due until Thursday, it previewed the reforecasting for the Legislature’s Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee on Tuesday, whose members’ questioned whether the uncertainty was inherently negative.
“At this point, the risk really is primarily on the downside,” said State Economist Amanda Rector, who chairs the Revenue Forecasting Committee, implying that revenue is more likely to see losses than gains. 
However, she noted that it’s possible the economic outlook could be resolved in a way that ultimately boosts consumer and business confidence. 
While stating the revenue prediction is the best the committee could do based on the current economic forecast, Rector acknowledged, “I would say that certainly it’s not the highest level of confidence probably in a forecast they’ve ever done.”
By the numbers 
With all of that uncertainty in mind, the state is still expected to bring in roughly $11.2 million in the next biennium, 2026 and 2027. 
After factoring in the updated revenue forecast and laws enacted so far this session, the state is now expected to end fiscal year 2027 with $125,278,261, according to Christopher Nolan, director of the nonpartisan Office of Fiscal and Program Review. 
That’s essentially the pot lawmakers now have left to fund legislation, though taxes and other revenue generating options are also being considered. 
In March, Democrats pushed through a roughly $11.3 million, two-year budget plan without Republican support after Senate Republicans refused to back a change package for the current fiscal year to address the immediate funding deficit for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, unless it included structural reform to the program.
At the time that budget passed, the state had expected to be left with about $127 million at the end of fiscal year 2027. The lower figure that Nolan shared is largely due to the cost — about $3.2 million — associated with a law passed earlier this month that aims to address the limited availability of indigent defense in the state. 
The two-year budget passed so far only continued baseline spending and funded the emergency measures initially attempted in the change package, so Democrats said it was only “part one.” 
That budget also did not fund another expected shortfall for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, which Democrats said was intentionally left out while they waited for the updated projections and any changes coming from Washington, D.C.. 
Republicans have argued that Democrats passed an unbalanced budget because it didn’t include that or any of the policy changes legislators may be looking to adopt in a “part two” budget.

Gov. Janet Mills proposed some tax increases and program cuts for the next biennium and those recommendations appear to remain the same for this next budget, as Mills’ press secretary Ben Goodman said on Tuesday, “We are not anticipating the release of any new budget proposal.”
Earlier Tuesday during a press conference, Senate Republican Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said what the minority party in Maine is able to get into the state budget may also depend on what’s ultimately included in the congressional budget. 
Stewart and his caucus will continue to call for structural reform to MaineCare. In particular, legislative Republicans want the state to request a waiver to institute work requirements for able-bodied, childless adults to access Medicaid, a restriction the federal government is also weighing. 
“Clearly, legislative Democrats don’t want to move on any of those issues,” Stewart said, “but they might be forced to.”
 ‘Considerable uncertainty’
The phrase “considerable uncertainty” came up in the committee’s deliberations time and time again, said Megan Bailey, senior economic analyst in the Maine Office of the State Economist, during the latest revenue forecasting committee meeting on Monday. 
This phrase was uttered when it came to economic policy, government spending, consumer sentiment, geopolitical tensions and consumer sentiment, Bailey said. 
The commission also made a specific assumption about Maine likely being at a greater risk from federal funding uncertainty, given that it’s already faced what’s widely considered retribution from the Trump administration over the state’s protections for transgender people, as well as tariff policy changes, given that Canada is Maine’s largest trading partner and that the state relies on Canadian tourism.  
“Until there is better knowledge about how some of these federal policies and changes will settle out, they didn’t see much of a compelling reason to change much of their forecast,” Bailey said, noting in that way the commission followed the lead taken by the Federal Reserve and Federal Open Market Committee.

If conditions change “enough to warrant a revised forecast,” Bailey said the commission is discussing the possibility of revising projections ahead of its next scheduled update on Nov. 1.
Members of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee pressed Rector Tuesday on what specific conditions would warrant an earlier revision. Rector said there would need to be “pretty significant evidence” that economic conditions or revenue positions were sufficiently different from the existing forecasts and, specifically, reliable data for them to base any such changes on. 
“This is, in some ways, similar to the early stages of the pandemic,” Rector said, “where things were changing very, very rapidly, but at that point, there was no evidence to sort of say, ‘Ah, this is how we need to update the forecast,’ so the commission had to wait long enough to get some data to look at before they came back.” 
In other ways, this moment is markedly different from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The two-year budget was ‘not the last word.’ Here’s what comes next.

Forecasting Committee member Michael Allen, who is associate commissioner of tax policy for the state, said the Federal Reserve played a significant role in mitigating the economic downturn then. But in a “normal” recession, it takes time for people to feel the effects. It took almost a year for anyone to really feel the impacts of the Great Recession around 2008, Allen said as an example. 
“If there’s a problem, it’s probably something that’s slowly building,” Allen said. “I think all of this reflects the fact that, at the moment, the information coming in is still pretty good.” 
As Rector noted earlier, a lot of the uncertainty hinges on frayed consumer confidence, while fears of tariffs and spending cuts have yet to show up in the numbers. 
Inflation growth has remained somewhat elevated and the commission is expecting more upward pressure from tariffs. 
Annual inflation according to the Consumer Price Index was 3% in 2024, which was slightly higher than the commission’s forecast of 2.7%. Because of that, as well as the expected impact of tariffs, it increased its inflation predictions for the 2025 fiscal year from 2.4% to 3.2% and 2026 from 2.3% to 2.8%. 
The commission left its inflation prediction for 2027 unchanged at 2.2% and slightly decreased its predictions for 2028 and 2029, both from 2.2% to 2.1%. 
The commission also updated its predictions for two components of personal income, reducing the forecasted growth for “dividends, interest, and rent” as well as nonfarm property income, because growth for both in 2024 was smaller than expected. 
Aside from federal uncertainty, the commission noted some of the continued pressures on the state level, including a tight labor market, aging workforce, strained housing market and climate-related disruptions starting to impact the hospitality industry.

(Photo illustration by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Former Indiana Congressional candidate Gabriel “Gabe” Whitley was sentenced to three months in federal prison Tuesday after he admittedly falsified campaign finance records and lying about raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions ahead of the May 2024 primary.
The sentence followed a plea deal agreement offered by the U.S. attorney’s office earlier this year.
Judge James Sweeney, who serves on the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, said at the Tuesday hearing in Indianapolis that the “fairly short” imposed sentence took into account Whitley’s lack of criminal history, in addition to his “troubled, traumatic childhood” and multiple, ongoing mental health challenges.
But Whitley’s campaign crime “is a serious offense” and involved “multiple layers of fabrication,” Sweeney said.
“The power of trust that we, the American people, put in the political process and in our representatives — the public needs to trust the system, at least,” the judge said. “We need to have confidence in the process and the integrity of the system, even if the political candidate doesn’t have that same integrity.”

Whitley claimed in the courtroom that he did not know his campaign finance fillings were fraudulent. But the judge said his sentence — less than the six month-maximum which could have been imposed — took into account that Whitley “clearly knew there was something not proper.”
Sweeney emphasized, too, that serving some prison time “will help deter others” who are running for political office from committing similar campaign crimes.
Questions about Whitley’s campaign finances were first reported by the Indiana Capital Chronicle early last year. 
Whitley admitted that he lied to the FEC in three separate reports about hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from supporters and loans from himself. 
Specifically, Whitley admitted that in October 2023, he falsely claimed that 67 people — whose biographical details he made up — had contributed approximately $222,690 to his Honest Gabe for Congress, according to federal protestors.
In January 2024, Whitley again falsely reported contributions from individuals “whose biographical details he fabricated,” prosecutors said. He did the same in April 2024, falsifying a $100,000 loan to his campaign.
Federal judge hears both sides
In addition to prison time, Whitley’s sentence included a $100 fine, a $100 fee for special assessments and a year of supervised probation following his release.
Sweeney further recommended that Whitley complete substance abuse treatment — citing a positive drug test for marijuana in late January — plus a mental health evaluation and treatment, as well as vocational training.  
In remarks provided during the two-hour hearing, Whitley asked the court for “leniency” and indicated that he has “no intentions of returning to politics.”
“I am embarrassed to be here today,” he said in a prepared statement. “I take full responsibility for my crimes, and I deeply regret the harm caused by my actions.”
“This prosecution has been embarrassing … and I know this will always follow me,” Whitley continued, referring to news articles and social media posts about his case “that future employers can look up” online. 










He deprived the electorate of what they value most — and why these rules exist — and that’s transparency.


– Federal prosecutor Nicole Lockhart


Still, the former candidate pointed a finger at a former employer “that taught me to lie about my filings … but later I learned it was not correct.” Whitley did not name the company when asked by the judge. Whitley’s court-appointed attorney, Gwendolyn Beitz, said the employer’s name was previously provided to the prosecution team.
Whitley repeatedly referenced his autism and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnoses, which he said contribute to his “hot head” and “impulsive tendencies.” 
“I don’t intend to come across the way people look at me,” he added.
But prosecutor Nicole Lockhart maintained that “this was not an impulsive crime.” She said Whitley’s fraudulent filings “happened multiple times, over multiple months, in multiple reports.” 
“He deprived the electorate of what they value most — and why these rules exist — and that’s transparency,” Lockhart said. 
Indiana congressional candidate faces campaign finance scrutiny

She additionally pointed to two recent lawsuits lodged by Whitley, one against the FBI Indianapolis Field Office and the federal agent who investigated the case; and the other against the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana and the U.S. Department of Justice.
The lawsuits, which have since been dismissed, were filed by Whitley after his February plea hearing and alleged that his admissions of guilt had been coerced, and that he was being “maliciously prosecute(s) … without probable cause, motivated by a conflict of interest and political bias.”
Prosecutors said those “incendiary” complaints — along with other lawsuits in Marion County Superior Court — showed that Whitley “has continued to demonstrate an utter lack of respect for the judiciary.” 
In one motion filed in Marion County, for example, Whitley stated that the African American judge presiding over his case, got his “law license from a Cracker Jack box because they don’t give monkeys real law license [sic].” 
U.S. attorneys held that “such conduct from an individual who had pleaded guilty to a criminal offense only several weeks before reflects a lack of seriousness in engaging with the judicial process and suggests that a probationary sentence would be an insufficient deterrent.”
Defending her client, Beitz contended that Whitley’s speech — while detestable — is protected under the First Amendment.
Earlier allegations brought up in court
But a turning point in the hearing appeared to come when Sweeney questioned Whitley directly about campaign finance concerns predating his federal case. The judge specifically cited reporting by The Evansville Courier & Press in 2021 about Whitley’s campaign documents filed during his short-lived Evansville mayoral campaign.
The paper reported Whitley’s fundraising reports filed with the state in 2021 and 2022 raised questions that he may have violated Indiana election law by documenting he raised thousands of dollars in campaign cash from people who denied giving him donations.
Whitley said he hired an unnamed political consulting firm to solicit contributions via email on his behalf. He reported no such expenditures on his 2021 and 2022 campaign finance filings, though.

Sweeney pressed Whitley about earlier suspicions of fraud and asked whether he had filed the false federal reports before or after the state-level allegations surfaced.
Whitley told the judge he was never aware of problems with his campaign filings and emphasized that Indiana’s Election Division dismissed related complaints.
Even so, Sweeney said that was no excuse for later, fraudulent filings during Whitley’s congressional race, and argued that the former candidate “should have been on notice” as far back as 2021.
Complaints alleging Whitley’s excessive federal campaign contributions and fraudulent financial reporting were sent to the Federal Election Commission (FEc) and the Indiana Election Division in February 2024 by Gabrielle Kendall, wife of WIBC radio host Rob Kendall. At the time, Whitley told the Indiana Capital Chronicle the accusations were “absurd.”
When asked by the Capital Chronicle if the contested donors are real, Whitley said “there’s no more comment I’m going to say on that,” Whitley said. “We’ve been in compliance with the FEC. We talked with them. We have a good relationship with them.”
Later, in August 2024, Whitley was arrested in a separate case for alleged online threats and harassment he made against Indianapolis-based political commentator Abdul-Hakim Shabazz. That case is still pending in Marion County Superior Court, with a jury trial scheduled for mid-July.

Nucor, which markets itself as the largest producer and recycler of steel in North America, is hosting Vance on Thursday. During the visit, Vance is expected to promote the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s second term and what the administration is calling a “manufacturing renaissance.”
He will be joined by the Environmental Protection Agency Chief Lee Zeldin.
Trump’s plan for the supposed renaissance has centered around imposing tariffs — taxes paid by the importing company or buyer to the government that issued them, in this case the U.S. The president’s 25% tariffs on foreign steel shipped into the country went into effect last month.
Nucor, which is headquartered in Charlotte and employs some 1,000 people at its Lowcountry plant, did not respond to the SC Daily Gazette’s request for comment. But the company has been a supporter of Trump’s tariffs from the get-go, telling multiple national media outlets the president’s trade policy will bring a revival in American made goods.
“It’s not a free trade, it’s fair-trade and creating a level playing field, I believe these tariffs are going to do that,” Nucor CEO Leon Topalian said during a February CNBC interview.
The company says it currently produces roughly a quarter of all raw steel refined in the U.S.
Meanwhile other industries, such as South Carolina’s multibillion-dollar automobile sector, have worried about the potential negative impact of tariffs.
John McGrath, the recently elected head of the Berkeley County GOP said the visit “highlights the vital role Berkeley County plays in American manufacturing.”
“I’m proud to welcome him and appreciate his focus on the hardworking people who power our local economy,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/VanceConvention-scaled-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-29 19:08:18.492906

What happens in weekly lunch-hour caucus meetings? The parties discuss their priorities for the week and strategize. Sometimes things get feisty, either internally or lashing out across the aisle. Once or twice a session, it can make the news, but mostly, it’s mundane. Why the change? Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, the majority leader, assured me it’s not that interesting, and she’s heard no complaints about the switch.  “I made the call that, you know, if the press is there, great, they’re welcome to report out what’s said. But the actual burden of video taping, it is a new one,” she said, “and not one that I felt like we had the staff capacity to maintain in a way that was quality.”Last year, Senate Dems streamed weekly from the legislative lounge. Now, they’re stationed in the Pavilion, Room 267.And the Republicans? They’ve never streamed. Minority Leader Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, said he has no intention of changing that. Nor would he share where the GOP meets, except to say it was outside the Statehouse.“If a reporter made a request to attend an off-site meeting, I would relay that request to the caucus,” he said, asking me if I was making such a request. For the moment, my answer was no. I did, though, stroll over to the Dems meeting. Senators walked in lunch in tow, still muttering about this morning’s floor session.The spiciest chatter concerned the $77 million Gov. Phil Scott and many lawmakers want to use to buy down property taxes this year. Some Democrats, including Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, argue a chunk of that money should be saved for the future, else lawmakers create a funding cliff that spikes property tax rates next year. “I just think that we, collectively as a caucus, should have talked about this,” Hardy said of the buy down money and the party’s budget priorities. Those present said that how to use the $77 million remains an open question for the Finance Committee to solve. But Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, cautioned his colleagues about saving money for next year. Doing so, he warned, could make the Senate look like it was raising property taxes more than the House and governor. “It’s not an academic discussion,” he said, “This is very much a live political discussion, and we are in a very weak position if we decide we’re going for higher tax rates.”—Ethan WeinsteinIn the knowThe Senate voted Tuesday to condemn “the manner and circumstances” of the arrest of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist and yearslong Upper Valley resident, by federal immigration agents in Colchester earlier this month.   Senators advanced a resolution about Mahdawi’s arrest on a 24-5 vote, with the “nays” all coming from among the chamber’s 13 Republicans. The measure, S.R.13, also called for Mahdawi — who’s been detained for more than two weeks at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town — to be “immediately released” as his case proceeds in federal court, adding that he also should “be afforded due process.”The vote comes a day before a hearing is scheduled in Mahdawi’s case when a judge in Burlington could rule on whether the federal government must release him. The Senate resolution is slated for a final vote Wednesday, and is expected to pass. Its lead sponsor, Windsor County Democratic Sen. Becca White, was with Mahdawi in Colchester shortly before he was arrested by masked, armed agents at an appointment for U.S. citizenship.Read more about the floor debate on the Senate measure here.— Shaun RobinsonOn the moveThe House on Tuesday approved an amended version of S.36, a Senate bill that was originally largely focused on addressing increasing the length of stay at residential treatment facilities that the state’s Medicaid program would pay for someone with a co-occuring substance use and mental health disorders. The bill the House passed continues to require that the length of stay covered shall be what is prescribed by a health care provider employed by the residential facility. It also repealed a sunset on when a person deemed incapacitated through intoxication or withdrawal can be kept overnight in a state prison for their own safety. The House version continues with both actions, but also requires additional reporting from the state Department of Health and Mental Health on their efforts to expand the overnight space available outside of prisons — now called “public inebriate” beds. It also changes the term to “persons who are incapacitated.” The amended version now also asks the Agency of Human Services to present proposals by the end of the year for reforming how the Human Services Board — which oversees appeals regarding eligibility for a variety of support programs including, Medicaid and housing and food assistance — operates to ensure consistent and respectful treatment of people who come before it. The amended version will now return to the Senate for its consideration.— Kristen FountainVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: In the Senate, weekly party meetings aren’t posted for all to see.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/kesha-ram-hinsdale-1-20250225.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 19:08:18.492906

The Cornhusker State is the only one that sends inheritance tax revenue exclusively to counties, with much of it used to fund bridges and roads.","State Sen. Robert Clements of Elmwood asks a question during a hearing on Oct. 27, 2023, in Lincoln. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A proposal to decrease Nebraska’s inheritance tax advanced Tuesday with a 27-10 vote. 
Nebraska is just one of six states that still has an inheritance tax. The Cornhusker State is the only one that sends inheritance tax revenue exclusively to counties, with much of it used to fund bridges and roads.
Elmwood State Sen. Robert Clements’ proposal would lower the inheritance tax rate to 1% for children and 3% for distant relatives and non-relatives, but would not eliminate the tax. It would replace lost county revenue by increasing county fees, adding to the costs of motor vehicle inspections and marriage licenses. 
The proposal also would cost the state $3 million a year in projected revenue over the next two fiscal years, as it would increase the county’s share of the state’s insurance premium tax, at a time when the state budget shortfall continues to grow.
Fee increases
It would increase fees on property and asset seizures to cover personal debts, advertising for delinquent properties, a higher tax on renewable energy generation, and it would eliminate some business tax breaks.
Clements said his proposal, Legislative Bill 468, would help attract people to move to Nebraska and make the inheritance tax rate fairer. The Nebraska Association of County Officials, which backs the Clements bill, estimates the proposal could increase county revenues by roughly $8.9 million.
Currently, Nebraska imposes a 1% tax on inheritances exceeding $100,000 for children, parents, and siblings. Higher tax rates are charged to more distant relatives — 11% for aunts and uncles and nieces and nephews after a $40,000 exemption. Non-relatives would have to pay 15% after a $25,000 exemption. 
Nebraska Taxpayers for Freedom and the Nebraska Republican Party testified in support of the bill during its hearing in February, saying it would end the state’s “outlier” status in imposing an inheritance tax and stop wealthy residents from moving away to avoid the tax. 
“Nebraska is losing retirees faster than we are gaining population from other states,” Clements said. “Our inheritance tax contributes to this migration. I believe we can do better as a state in this area and give people more reasons to stay in our state.”
Paying the costs
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln said the debate on the inheritance tax continued the theme of the state “balancing budgets on the backs of everyday hard-working Nebraskans.”
  State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, center. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Lincoln State Sen. Eliot Bostar filed two failed amendments: One would have eliminated the inheritance tax without replacing the revenue, and another would have let counties increase local sales taxes to make up the lost revenue. Bostar said that when he started in the Legislature, he had a misunderstanding about who paid the tax. 
“There are a lot of fairly trivial things that if you have enough resources, you can do in order to avoid paying this tax,” Bostar said. “So that leaves everyone in the middle.” 
Lincoln State Sen. Jane Raybould also had a failed amendment that would have tweaked the tax rates of the new proposal. She emphasized the “unintended consequences.” Lawmakers have expressed concerns in the past that eliminating the inheritance tax could lead to higher property taxes but said Clements’ proposal strikes a “nice balance” of helping replace the lost revenue.  
“I don’t think there’s any perfect way to reimburse, dollar for dollar, the counties for any lost revenues resulting from the changes proposed in the inheritance tax,” Syracuse’s Sen. Bob Hallstrom said. 
Hunting a balanced approach
But Hallstrom praised the Clements proposal’s balance. Lawmakers on both sides of ​​the aisle raised issues about the increase in other fees and taxes to make up for lost county revenue. A few Democratic-aligned lawmakers expressed concerns about the measure’s proposed increase in the nameplate capacity tax on renewable energy sources and its impact on school revenue.
  State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
LB 468 would nearly double the nameplate capacity tax from $3,518 per megawatt of electricity generated to $6,560 per megawatt. 
“I think that I would say it’s pretty hard to be doubling this [Nameplate Capacity] tax to me,” Omaha Sen. Margo Juarez said. 
Some Republican-aligned lawmakers expressed worries over the elimination of some business incentives and the tax exemption for data center equipment. The bill also would do away with tax breaks in the ImagiNE Act for data centers and modernizing large businesses.
Clements said school revenue wouldn’t be negatively affected because of the increase in fees. 
Nebraska’s budget shortfall, at least in part, is due to tax cuts that lawmakers passed in recent years. Throughout the session, lawmakers have proposed scaling back various tax incentive programs, reducing the state’s school retirement contributions by $80 million, and increasing taxes on nicotine pouches. 
Clements said he would propose amendments to address lawmakers’ concerns about where the inheritance tax replacement revenue comes from. He said he wants to eliminate the tax next year. 
“Just because he’s been committed to the issue for many years,” said Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln said of Clements’ proposal, “it doesn’t mean that this proposal results in good policy.”

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)MIAMI — An irritated federal judge said Tuesday that she found it “problematic” and offensive that Florida’s attorney general called illegitimate and unlawful her order temporarily blocking an immigration law that led to the arrest of a U.S. citizen.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams grilled attorneys representing Attorney General James Uthmeier during a hearing here. At issue was an April 23 letter Uthmeier sent to law enforcement declaring that he couldn’t stop them from enforcing a law that makes it a first-degree misdemeanor to illegally enter the state as an “unauthorized alien” and adds heightened penalties for re-entry.
“Do I need to put a ribbon on it?” Williams asked, referring to what more she could do to make her order legitimate.
The temporary restraining order barring the state from enforcing the law was to expire Tuesday, but Williams said she hoped to rule before midnight on whether to extend the suspension for the remainder of the litigation.
‘Surprised and shocked’
The Florida Immigrant Coalition and The Farmworker Association of Florida sued the state over the constitutionality of the law, which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed on Feb. 13, which led to Williams’ emergency block on the law on April 4.
However, law enforcement continued arrests after Williams’ order, with a Florida Highway Patrol trooper arresting Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen born in Georgia, in Leon County on April 16. The 20-year-old stayed in the Leon County Jail for more than 24 hours.
  Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier via his office
“It is my view that no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforce Florida’s new illegal entry and reentry laws,” Uthmeier wrote on April 23 to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, FHP, sheriffs, and police officers.
No arrests under the suspended law have taken place since Williams further clarified on April 18 that her order applied to law enforcement, said Jeffrey DeSousa, an attorney for the defendants.
Defendants in the suit, including Uthmeier and Florida’s state attorneys, have taken the position that law enforcement isn’t bound by the judge’s order because they’re not named defendants in the suit.
Before calling the order illegitimate, Uthmeier sent a letter on April 18, at the direction of Williams, to law enforcement stating that they shouldn’t make arrests under the temporarily blocked law.
“Color me surprised and shocked,” Williams said, asking what had happened in the five days between the letters.
DeSousa said the state didn’t view the April 23 letter as an invitation for law enforcement to disobey the order. Williams disagreed.
Social media posts prompt skepticism from judge
But Uthmeier’s actions in two months in office, flexing his power over agencies and local elected officials, could derail the argument that he can’t discipline law enforcement or direct them to do anything. DeSantis appointed Uthemeier, his former chief of staff, as attorney general in February.
Williams called out social media posts from Uthmeier stating that he had directed FDLE and FHP to monitor protests at Tesla dealerships and FDLE and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to execute a search warrant at a Panama City Beach aquarium.
The judge also brought up letters Uthmeier sent threatening with removal from office the Fort Myers City Council and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer if their municipalities didn’t allow their police to partake in immigration enforcement.
“I don’t see how you can escape all the statements he has made,” Williams said.
Who’s law enforcement listening to?
Aside from discussion regarding Uthmeier’s actions, Williams raised concerns about due process, saying that further arrests under the law would lead to people spending days in jail under charges a prosecutor couldn’t move forward with.
Lopez-Gomez had to remain in jail despite the lack of probable cause for his arrest because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had requested that the jail hold him for 48 hours.
Despite expressing her irritation with Uthmeier, Williams said she wouldn’t make him sit for a deposition, a request plaintiffs’ attorneys said they were considering as the suit goes on.
The same day Uthmeier sent his letter saying he wouldn’t stand in the way of arrests, State Attorney Jack Campbell warned law enforcement to follow Williams’ order.
“This is not optional, and the Court has the ability to hold each of us in contempt for not following her direction,” Campbell, of Florida’s 2nd Judicial District, wrote.
Additionally, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, a member of the State Immigration Enforcement Council established earlier this year, said he and his deputies would listen only to the judge.
“I don’t think it changes anything,” Gualtieri said of Uthmeier’s first letter during a phone interview with Florida Phoenix. “We take our direction on something like that from the judge, not from anybody else.”
The parties agreed to meet again on May 29.

‘You just can’t walk up to people with brown skin and say give me your papers,’ a federal judge told Border Patrol attorneys at a hearing challenging recent immigration sweeps. 


A federal court on Tuesday issued a preliminary injunction forbidding the Border Patrol from conducting warrantless immigration stops throughout a wide swath of California. 
The ruling came in response to an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit filed after the El Centro Border Patrol traveled to Kern County to conduct a three-day sweep in January, detaining day laborers, farm workers and others in a Home Depot parking lot, outside a convenience store and along a highway between orchards.  
The ruling prohibits Border Patrol agents from taking similar actions, restricting them from stopping people unless they have a reasonable suspicion that the person is in violation of U.S. immigration law. It also bars agents from carrying out warrantless arrests unless they have probable cause that the person is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. 
“You just can’t walk up to people with brown skin and say, ‘Give me your papers,’” said U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer L. Thurston said during a Monday hearing in Fresno that featured moments of heated exchange between government attorneys and the judge.
The ACLU filed suit on behalf of United Farm Workers, arguing that the stops violated the Fourth Amendment. The judge has not decided on the totality of the case, but on Tuesday granted the ACLU’s motion to stop the Border Patrol from conducting similar operations while the case moved through the courts. 
“I think that it’s pretty clear that half of a century of really established law is being upheld. It’s unfortunate that this is a cause for celebration. It’s not legal to snatch people off the street for looking like farm workers or day laborers,” said Elizabeth Strater, vice president of United Farm Workers. 
California Attorney General Rob Bonta agreed. “That’s existing law, and the judge’s order reflects existing law.” 
“You can’t just indiscriminately stop people and search them without any appropriate reasonable suspicion or probable cause or without a warrant,” Bonta said at a news conference in San Diego on Monday about conditions in ICE detention. “So, it sounds like the judge had seen enough and wanted to issue an order. “
The injunction is in effect in the jurisdiction of California’s Eastern District, which spans the Central Valley from Redding to Bakersfield. 
After the January sweep, the man who led it, Chief Patrol Agent Gregory Bovino, said his agents specifically targeted people with criminal and immigration histories. However, a CalMatters investigation revealed that the Border Patrol had no criminal or immigration history on 77 of the 78 people it arrested.


The court also ordered the Border Patrol to document every stop and provide reports within 60 days. During oral arguments on Monday, the government attorney said doing so would be burdensome to Border Patrol agents. Judge Thurston rebuked the government, saying: “They have to make a report for every arrest, not sure what the burden is.” 
According to sworn declarations filed in court by those detained, Border Patrol agents slashed tires, yanked people out of trucks, threw people to the ground, and called farmworkers “Mexican bitches.”
Border Patrol attorneys characterized those examples as actions of individual agents, and not reflective of a policy from the agency. 
Thurston disagreed. “The evidence is that this was wide scale” and not limited to individual agents, she said.
Border Patrol agents receive new training
Border Patrol attorneys didn’t offer evidence of their own to dispute the evidence presented by the ACLU, including stopping people based on their race and warrantless arrests. They tried to persuade Thurston that the order would not be necessary because the agency is already taking steps to retrain its officers. In a previous court filing, government attorneys said Border Patrol had issued guidance to retrain the El Center sector’s 900 agents on the Fourth Amendment in order to prevent warrantless arrests. 
At Monday’s hearing, Thurston questioned why guidance would even be necessary since agents are trained on the Fourth Amendment in the academy. 
Government attorneys told the judge 270 agents have received the training. Thurston asked for details on how the training was being carried out. “Shift by shift?” she said. But government attorneys said they did not know. 
The packed courtroom was contentious at times. U.S. Department of Justice attorney Olga Y. Kuchins argued that the Border Patrol’s sweep in Kern County, known as “Operation Return to Sender” wasn’t standard policy. “This two-day operation does not a policy make,” she said. 
Thurston asked how many days were needed for an operation to be taken as policy, and on what authority the government was relying on to establish this operation could not be interpreted as part of Border Patrol policy. 
“Do you know of that authority?” Thurston said.
“I don’t know of that authority,” Kuchins said. 
The injunction also compels the El Centro Sector to provide proof within 90 days, and every 30 days thereafter, that agents involved in these operations have been trained on these rules. 
“This ruling is a powerful recognition that what happened in Kern County and surrounding area in January was illegal,” said Bree Bernwanger, ACLU senior staff attorney. 
She called it a “powerful reminder that law enforcement agents – including immigration – cannot stop you, detain you because of the color of your skin.”
Another immigration sweep
Even after government attorneys pledged to retrain agents on the Constitution, El Centro sector traveled more than 200 miles north to Pomona last week and rounded up day laborers outside a Home Depot, an action reminiscent of the Kern County raid. 
Witnesses say federal agents arrived in unmarked vehicles around 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, and quickly surrounded the Home Depot parking lot on South Towne Avenue. 
“When they saw that a critical mass was gathered, they executed the raid,” said Alexis Teodoro, a Worker Rights Director with the Pomona Economic Opportunity Center. 
According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, agents arrested 10 and placed them into removal proceedings. No other agencies were involved, said Michael Scappechio, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Advocates are adamant that more than 20 people were initially taken into custody, based on piecing together the accounts of different witnesses about what happened. 
Federal officials defended their actions, saying agents were initially targeting a single individual with an active arrest warrant. During the operation, nine other people were also taken into custody. Some of those detained had prior charges, including child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon, immigration violations, and DUI, said Hilton Beckham, the assistant commissioner for CBP’s office of public affairs.
Jesus Domingo Ross, 38, was standing on a street corner near the Home Depot in Pomona last week when, he said, agents appeared from all sides, grabbed him and threw him to the ground. 
“I panicked,” he said, describing the moment he realized he was in custody of U.S. immigration authorities. “Just with everything you’re seeing on the news right now, I really panicked because we didn’t know what was going to happen.” 
He spoke to CalMatters on Saturday night during visiting hours at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico, where he is now being held. 
“I’m trying to keep my confidence in God to carry me through this,” he said quietly.

(Photo provided by Humanities North Dakota)Humanities North Dakota has received $300,000 in private donations to keep its doors open after it learned earlier this month all its federal funding had been terminated.
That figure includes $200,000 from the New York-based Mellon Foundation, which on Tuesday pledged $15 million to a total of 56 humanities councils around the country. The other $100,000 came from other donors, according to Executive Director Brenna Gerhardt.
The money will help keep the organization afloat after its grant money was abruptly pulled by the federal government. But it only replaces a portion of the cut funding.
“The Mellon Foundation’s support is both a lifeline and a vote of confidence,” Gerhardt said in a Tuesday statement announcing the award.
In addition, Humanities North Dakota can receive up to $50,000 in matching funds from the Mellon Foundation with the help of local donors. The Mellon Foundation will double any contributions to Humanities North Dakota made after Tuesday. Donations can be made on the Humanities North Dakota website.
“At stake are both the operational integrity of organizations like museums, libraries, historical societies in every single state, as well as the mechanisms to participate in the cultural dynamism and exchange that is a fundamental part of American civic life,” Elizabeth Alexander, the Mellon Foundation’s president, said in a Tuesday announcement. 
Alexander said that even though the donation won’t cover all of the lost funding, she hopes the money will help councils get by.
Humanities North Dakota in limbo after loss of federal funding

Humanities North Dakota, which provides public education in areas including history, civics and the arts, has historically relied on funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities to cover operational costs. 
The nonprofit on April 2 received a letter from the federal agency that stated a $900,000 grant it received for the 2025 fiscal year had been terminated. Humanities North Dakota, which has four full-time and two part-time staff, had yet to spend more than $600,000 of the grant.
The National Endowment for the Humanities, which provides funding to humanities organizations across the country, is “repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda,” Acting Chairman Michael McDonald wrote in the letter.
The letter cites a Feb. 19 executive order by President Donald Trump which the White House says will streamline federal bureaucracy.
A total of $65 million in grant money awarded to 56 humanities councils serving U.S. states, territories and Washington, D.C., was terminated. 
In response to the funding cuts, Humanities North Dakota is launching a new initiative to share online programming with other humanities councils, Gerhardt said.
Called “The Study,” the effort is intended to help out councils that don’t have the funding to continue providing programming without the federal money. 
Humanities councils that join The Study will get access to livestreamed programs, a repository of recorded events and other content.

Humanities North Dakota is in a unique position to help other councils since it’s consistently held events online since the coronavirus pandemic, said Gerhardt.
“We’re the only one with the infrastructure to pivot this quickly,” she said. The hope is that North Dakota and other states begin collaborating and pooling resources so all Americans have access to humanities programming, she added.
Five other states have already joined the initiative — Washington, Iowa, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Montana, according to Gerhardt.
Humanities North Dakota will still provide the same programs moving forward, though the current plan is to cut the number of events by about half, Gerhardt said. The nonprofit’s programs, which include online classes, book talks, lectures and more, reached an estimated 24,000 people last year.
Congress created the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1965 and appropriates money for grants to humanities councils across the U.S.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A New Jersey state prison that houses young men had expired fire extinguishers, caked-on grime in the showers, and filthy, understaffed kitchens where water riddled with garbage and food scraps pooled on the floor, according to a new report a state watchdog released Tuesday.
State Corrections Ombudsperson Terry Schuster and his staff also found that most of those incarcerated at the Garden State Youth Correctional Facility in Burlington County had no pillows and were double-bunked in cells designed for single occupancy.
Many reported they lived without essential items like a towel, bedding, or change of clothes and sometimes encountered rodents and insects. Incarcerated people did not receive drinks with lunch or dinner during sultry summer months when temperatures on housing units sometimes topped 90 degrees, inspectors found.

Staff from the ombudsperson’s office, who inspect state prisons and advocate for improvements, visited the Garden State Youth facility several times between last July and March, interviewed staff and people incarcerated there, and reviewed records to draft the report released Tuesday.
The prison, which opened in 1967, houses more than 1,000 young men generally in their early 20s and most of whom are serving short sentences of a few years. Many were not engaged in meaningful work, rehabilitative programs, or school, inspectors found.
Schuster and his staff reported that Department of Corrections officials have since fixed some of the problems they brought to the state’s attention in the report, including replacing the fire extinguishers, ordering 1,200 pillows, improving shower ventilation, cleaning kitchens, and serving juice with meals. A larger capital construction project to renovate kitchen space was funded, with planning now underway.
“The Office would like to add to the chorus of voices calling for additional capital improvement funds to repair, replace, and maintain the infrastructure at Garden State Youth Correctional Facility, and applauds the Department for continuing to seek the funding it needs to provide a habitable and structurally sound facility,” the report says.
Schuster and his staff made several recommendations for further improvements, calling on the department to develop a strategic plan to limit double-bunking in small cells, regularly inventory cells for their maintenance needs and missing essential items, routinely audit food services, and establish incentives to increase work and school participation.
A Department of Corrections spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

(Courtesy of the Library of Congress)Montanans are still liable for damages they cause during a duel, at least as far as the state’s archaic legal code goes.
Of course, the actual act of standing at 10 paces and killing someone, even if mutually consensual, remains a criminal offense.
But the Montana Senate on Friday voted down a bill that sought to remove a statute requiring an individual to “provide for the maintenance of the spouse and minor children” of their opponent, and pay all of their debts.
House Bill 247, brought by Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, was billed as a simple code cleanup bill requested by the lieutenant governor’s office. 
In the first hearing on the legislation in January, Lt. Gov. Kristen Juras said that due to the illegality of killing another individual, the 1895 statute needed to be removed because “it implies that dueling is legal. It is not.”
The bill passed the House, 84-16.
But the Senate had a different view, with several senators taking great pleasure in the idea of keeping hypothetical duels in Montana statute. 
“Dueling is not specifically illegal in Montana. It’s against public policy because it’s against public policy to kill people,” Sen Andrea Olsen, D-Missoula, said on the Senate Floor. “…I do think if you’re willing to kill somebody over an issue, you should be willing to die over it. And I even think it’s a great thing if you’re willing to compensate the family for the damages you’ve caused. That’s what this statue is, it’s the remedies for dueling.”
Olsen said that the only reason given in committee for removing the statute was that it was considered “code clutter.”
“This is at least code clutter that brings a smile to everybody’s face. It actually hearkens back to the past in a way that is very interesting,” she had said during committee. 
Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, said the statute was one that gave him peace of mind. 
Laying out a scenario where in order to defend his honor, he challenged Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, to a duel, Zolnikov said he would likely lose that fight. 
But, “he’s now responsible for making sure my child and spouse are taken care of. And I like that in law,” Zolnikov said. 
Hertz said it would “be my honor,” to take care of the remaining Zolnikovs, if he won such a duel.
Before the Senate voted down the bill, 16-34, Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell, reminded his colleagues that anybody challenged in a duel has the right to designate the weapons and conditions of the face-off. 
“I suggest they do as Abraham Lincoln did,” Fuller said. “Cow pies at 10 paces.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duel-etching.jpg,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, listens during the governor's State of the State Address in the House chamber of the state Capitol on Feb. 3. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — House lawmakers overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would have required schools to add an extra instructional day for every $25 million more the Legislature appropriates to common education.
Supporters of Senate Bill 409 said that having students in the classroom for an extra day would help improve lagging student outcomes by providing additional face-to-face instruction time, and give taxpayers and lawmakers something concrete to show for their extra investment. 
A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers panned the idea, questioning how much benefit an extra instructional day would provide relative to its cost. They also questioned how far a $25 million investment would go amid soaring costs related to maintaining school property, inflation and the growing list of unfunded legislative mandates. 
Rep. Danny Sterling, R-Tecumseh, said requiring schools to add an additional day solely because they received a level of new funding does “nothing but make a mockery of the public education system.” 
He said lawmakers would be wasting taxpayer money on a strategy that has no valid data indicating it will produce benefits.
Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, the House author of the measure, said lawmakers in the past four years have put more money into Oklahoma schools than ever before, but outcomes have not kept up. In fact, he said, they’ve gotten worse.
He said he hopes something like this will reverse the trend.
“If our teachers spending more time in front of our students isn’t helpful, isn’t impactful for the outcomes in their education, then man, we’ve got to have some other conversations because something must be wrong with the system somewhere,” he said.
Caldwell said most data will show that probably the single greatest determining factor in a child’s education is a quality teacher.
“So it just stands to my simple brain that if we give that teacher another day or two or five or 10, that’s going to be better for the child,” he said. “And when the senator, (Adam Pugh, R-Edmond), asked me to run this bill, I just never thought that I’m going to have to really fight to say teachers in front of our kids for an additional day that that’s actually a good thing. I felt like that was pretty universal.”
He said one extra day isn’t going to “drastically change the trajectory” of poor academic outcomes, but maybe it will get the state a step closer.
“We get asked every single year to invest more money in our schools, simply just giving it there and hoping that we get something out of it hasn’t seemed to be working,” he said.
Caldwell said taxpayers have a right to expect a return on their investment.
Rep. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City, said the concern is that one extra day isn’t going to move the needle and spending legislative time fighting over adding a single day is distracting from bigger priorities.
“We could be spending today on curriculum,” he said. “We could be spending today on reining in the state superintendent, but we’re instead spending it on this one piece of legislation that might add an extra day and cost extra money.
Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, said he’s concerned about the impact of inflation and the growth of expenses on schools. He said property and casualty insurance is increasing in cost. Student enrollment is growing as are the number of programs and tests lawmakers are asking districts to implement.
“What does this bill do about those kinds of increases in expenses that might eat up to $25 million?” he asked.
House lawmakers voted 22-63 to reject the bill.

According to the state's top education official, some Mass. schools have reported ""extended absences"" for students as a result of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement.
The post Tutwiler: Immigration chill leading to “extended absences” appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","SOME MASSACHUSETTS schools have reported “extended absences” for students as a result of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement, according to the state’s top education official.Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler on Tuesday devoted a portion of his regular report to the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education to recent clashes between Massachusetts elected officials and the federal government, including on K-12 school funding.Although he did not offer specific data about a rise in students missing school, Tutwiler said some areas have seen a rise in absences amid reported concerns about immigration crackdowns.“Federal actions around immigration are also a concern for many of our school communities, in some cases, resulting in extended absences for students,” he said. “We are working with the attorney general’s office and the state Office for Refugees and Immigrants to keep districts updated on policy changes that can impact immigrant status.”Some districts, like Lynn, reported significant increases in student absences early in President Donald Trump’s second term, according to CBS News. Sen. Brendan Crighton of Lynn spoke Monday about a Lynn high school student who was detained by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and moved to Maine in January. Though the student was released, Crighton said fear of a similar situation exists throughout the city’s schools.Tutwiler also recounted the Trump administration’s move to rescind $106 million in federal funding from K-12 schools in Massachusetts, which Attorney General Andrea Campbell challenged in a lawsuit alongside more than a dozen other states.Campbell joined another case last week over the U.S. Department of Education’s threat to withhold dollars from state and local agencies over diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in schools.“We continue to push back against harmful federal funding cuts and policy changes that threaten the stability of our local school districts and well-being of our students and educators and here in Massachusetts,” Tutwiler said. “We’ve said this before: We’ll stay true to our department’s educational vision of all students being known, valued and having the support that they need to succeed.”The post Tutwiler: Immigration chill leading to “extended absences” appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tutwiler.webp?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

Photo by Shaun Robinson/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — The Vermont Senate voted Tuesday to condemn “the manner and circumstances” of the arrest of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist and yearslong Upper Valley resident, by federal immigration agents in Colchester earlier this month.   Senators advanced a resolution about Mahdawi’s arrest on a 24-5 vote, with the “nays” all coming from among the chamber’s 13 Republicans. The measure, S.R.13, also called for Mahdawi — who’s been detained for more than two weeks at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town — to be “immediately released” as his case proceeds in federal court, adding that he also should “be afforded due process.”The vote comes a day before a hearing is scheduled in Mahdawi’s case when a judge in Burlington could rule on whether the federal government must release him. The Senate resolution is slated for a final vote Wednesday, and is expected to pass. Its lead sponsor, Windsor County Democratic Sen. Becca White, was with Mahdawi in Colchester shortly before he was arrested by masked, armed agents at an appointment for U.S. citizenship.“This is an issue about which the Vermont Senate has a direct tie,” said the chamber’s President Pro Tempore, Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, on the floor. “We have a witness,” Baruth continued, who “has helped us to see the urgency of this moment.” The Vermont House approved a similar statement criticizing Mahdawi’s detention last week. That measure, H.R.8, passed on a voice vote, so individual members’ decisions aren’t on the record — though a number of “nays” were audible around the chamber.Attorneys for the Columbia University student, who is a lawful U.S. resident, argued last week in court that the federal government illegally targeted him for his pro-Palestinian speech at campus protests and that he shouldn’t have been detained. President Donald Trump’s administration, meanwhile, has said that Mahdawi should be removed from the country because his presence “would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest,” according to court filings.READ MORE

Several Vermont senators who voted against the resolution Tuesday made remarks on the floor opposing it. Sen. David Weeks, R-Rutland, said he had spoken with a “law enforcement specialist” who reviewed the details of Mahdawi’s arrest, and Weeks thinks that, while “absolutely unusual,” it was “in keeping with law enforcement procedures.”Baruth responded on the floor that while he understood there are situations where police operate with anonymity, he thinks Mahdawi’s detention deserves to be called out because it’s part of a larger pattern of similar arrests of students in recent weeks.Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, then told his colleagues he did not “think that there was much to talk about” regarding whether Mahdawi’s arrest was carried out lawfully, considering also, he said, “the amount of illegal immigration that was perpetrated by the previous administration,” referring to former President Joe Biden.In addition to Ingalls and Weeks, Sen. Terry Williams, also a Rutland Republican; Sen. Steve Heffernan, R-Addison; and Sen. Robert Norris, R-Franklin, voted against the measure. Sen. Larry Hart, R-Orange, wasn’t on the Senate floor for the vote.During Mahdawi’s appointment earlier this month, which was at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Colchester, the student affirmed his commitment to “defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign, and domestic,” according to court filings submitted by his attorneys.But afterward, an immigration official told Mahdawi he needed to “‘check’ on some information,” and “ICE agents, masked and visibly armed, entered the interview room and shackled” Mahdawi, court filings state.The federal officers ushered Mahdawi into a vehicle and attempted to get him on a plane en route to Louisiana, his lawyers have said. But Mahdawi’s attorneys quickly filed a lawsuit, and a judge issued a temporary order to keep him in Vermont.Mahdawi, who grew up in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, told NPR in an interview the outlet published Tuesday that he arrived at the appointment thinking it would be his final step to becoming a citizen after spending 10 years in the U.S.“I am centered internally. I am at peace,” he told the outlet, speaking at the prison in St. Albans Town. “While I still know deeply that this is a level of injustice that I am facing, I have faith. I have faith that justice will prevail.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Senate votes to condemn Mohsen Mahdawi’s arrest by immigration agents.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/baruth-hinsdale-white-senate-immigration-ICE-MOU-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

(Courtesy of the Utah Senate)Utah state leaders are taking the next steps in their efforts to make Utah a major nuclear energy development hub and a “national leader” in developing next-generation energy technology, reaching beyond state lines to do it.
It starts with Utah signing two memorandums of understanding with Idaho and Wyoming as part of a strategy to fire up innovation and collaboration in the region.
As part of Gov. Spencer Cox’s “Built Here: Nuclear Energy Summit,” which his office said brought together leaders from across the nuclear energy industry on Tuesday, Cox joined Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon in signing an MOU that calls for the three states to work together coordinating nuclear infrastructure, accelerating nuclear development, and advocating for “commonsense federal policies.”
“The West will lead the next chapter of energy abundance and American prosperity,” Cox said in a statement announcing the alliance. “Today, we brought together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to chart the course for nuclear energy. Our new compact strengthens our shared commitment to aggressively pursue more affordable, reliable energy across state lines.”
According to Cox’s office, the states agreed in the MOU to collaborate on:

Aligning energy policies to support innovation and private investment.
Coordinating the development of critical energy infrastructure.
Jointly navigating regulatory and environmental challenges.
Advocating for federal support of regional energy priorities.
Enhancing energy resilience and grid reliability.
Expanding workforce development efforts to support the growing energy sector.
Ensuring continued delivery of affordable energy to residents. 

The tri-state agreement comes the day after Utah officials and the Idaho National Laboratory — one of 17 national labs in the U.S. Department of Energy complex that’s focused on nuclear research — signed a memorandum of understanding Monday evening after ceremoniously signing a slate of energy bills Utah lawmakers passed earlier this year. 
The MOU between Utah leaders and the Idaho National Laboratory establishes a “formal, long-term collaboration on advanced energy research, workforce development and technology deployment — particularly on nuclear innovation,” according to the governor’s office. 
“This partnership will accelerate Utah’s efforts to become the nation’s nuclear hub,” Gov. Spencer Cox said in a prepared statement issued Monday evening. “By linking our universities, labs, and industry partners with the expertise of Idaho National Laboratory, we are strengthening our ability to serve Utahns with reliable and affordable energy.”
Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner, who signed the MOU, said he and other lab officials are “excited to partner with Utah to address urgent energy needs by focusing on advanced nuclear and energy innovation.” 
Glowing pains: Developing nuclear power could cost Utah tens of billions

“This partnership establishes a cooperative framework for scientific, technological and workforce development to help Utah realize an abundant, secure, resilient and competitive energy future,” he said. 
The MOU, according to the governor’s office, creates a “structural, interdisciplinary alliance” between Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory. It envisions Utah as establishing a new institute called the Advanced Nuclear Energy Institute as a “key coordinating hub” between the Idaho National Laboratory, Utah’s system of higher education, the Utah Office of Energy Development, and the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab. 
“By linking the capabilities of INL with the talent and resources of Utah’s higher education institutions, this partnership positions Utah as a national leader in developing the next generation of clean, secure and resilient energy technologies,” the governor’s office said in Monday’s news release. 
This new institute, state officials say, will enable Utah’s universities to collaborate with other organizations to pursue federal research grants. 
“Beyond academic research, the focus is on applied innovation — ensuring resources are used effectively to develop commercially viable, scalable technologies,” the governor’s office said. “This approach will accelerate the deployment of real-world energy solutions and help build a broader, more robust nuclear energy ecosystem in Utah and the surrounding region.”
With more local input, Legislature signs on to the beginning of Utah’s nuclear future

Through the MOU, state leaders say Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory will work together to: 

Accelerate development of “next-generation” nuclear technologies.
Enhance scientific research in energy sectors.
Strengthen cybersecurity and physical security for energy infrastructure.
Build up the workforce needed to meet demands of a future energy economy.

The Utah Legislature’s top Republican leaders both applauded the move as crucial for Utah’s future. 
“Affordable, reliable energy is the driving force behind Utah’s prosperity — powering everything from the lights in Utahns homes to the unstoppable growth of the state’s vibrant economy,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a prepared statement. “As energy demands increase and technologies rapidly evolve, we as a state are committed to staying ahead of the curve through strategic partnership that ensures both innovation and stability.”
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said Utah “is leading the way with smart, strategic investments in our energy future.” 
“This partnership drives innovation and keeps energy reliable and affordable for Utah families and businesses,” Schultz said. “It’s about long-term solutions that protect our economy and strengthen our position as a national energy leader.”

According to the complaint, “at the behest of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency,” AmeriCorps leadership placed all members serving in the National Civilian Community Corps on leave and told them their participation in the program would end on April 30; placed 85% of its staff on administrative leave and subsequently sent them reduction in force notices. Leadership then began notifying State Service Commissions, which distribute AmeriCorps grants, that $400 million worth of AmeriCorps programs were immediately terminated.
“AmeriCorps is a vital public service program in our country, and its sudden dismantling is not only reckless—it’s unlawful,” Torrez said in a statement. “Here in New Mexico, these cuts will hurt students, families, and underserved communities who rely on AmeriCorps-supported programs for education, housing, and critical community services. I’m proud to stand with my colleagues to defend this agency and protect the federal commitment to service, equity, and local resilience.”
According to a news release, New Mexico on April 25 received notice from the federal government of termination of its AmeriCorps grant programs, which support volunteer and service effort. The more than $2 million in AmeriCorps grants will impact a variety of programs in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Taos and Ruidoso, as well as programs serving rural, tribal and underserved populations across the state. The funding went to programs that include: “culturally responsive education, after-school and youth mentoring programs, special education services, teacher preparation, environmental conservation, and housing and support for at-risk and homeless youth.”
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), described as the first AmeriCorps member to serve in the U.S. Senate, said in a statement that AmeriCorps participants “do critical work in New Mexico, connecting veterans to services, helping fight the opioid epidemic, helping older adults age with dignity, and rebuilding communities after disasters. I will not stand idly by as Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and DOGE dismantle these programs in order to line the pockets of billionaires.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)The head of Maine’s child welfare agency shared a small but significant milestone with lawmakers on Tuesday: Over April school vacation last week, no child in state custody stayed in hotels or hospital emergency departments.
“I’m hopeful we are seeing some baby steps toward less children and less time being spent in hotels,” said Bobbi Johnson, director of the Office of Child and Family Services, told members of the Health and Human Services Committee during a briefing Tuesday.
Children in custody are placed in hotels and hospitals for a variety of reasons, including if the department is unable to place them with a resource family. The practice puts a significant strain on children and frontline workers, who have to work additional hours to supervise them in those settings.
Although the school vacation week was a bright spot, there were four children back in hotels or emergency departments as of Monday, Johnson said. 
As the agency continues to implement policy changes and recommendations to improve the system that was under scrutiny by the legislative watchdog last session, Johnson updated lawmakers on staff vacancies, another ongoing challenge for the department, in particular in the Lewiston office.
Two of the children back in hotels are based in the agency’s Lewiston district, which has seen particular difficulty with staff retention recently, Johnson said. 
Of the 56 caseworker vacancies across the state, 27 of them are in the Lewiston office, Johnson said. She noted that children in this district have been staying in those alternative settings for extended periods of time, putting even more strain on the limited staff.
As of March, the agency had almost 200 people approved to be “community sitters,” who are able to supervise the children at hotels and emergency departments in place of caseworkers. Johnson said those individuals covered more than 1,500 shifts last year for a total of 6,275 hours. Comparatively, OCFS staff covered more than 6,200 shifts totaling nearly 25,000 hours. 
Staff have told the agency that the workload and overtime required to supervise children in those settings are the biggest factors in the high turnover in the Lewiston district. While vacancies in that district had gone down, Johnson said they are trending up again. She attributed this to a variety of factors, but noted that the district has the highest number of kids in care. 
Since the Lewiston district covers a large geographic area in central Maine, Johnson said the agency is opening an office in the Farmington area with the hope of attracting new case worker candidates. Those positions have been posted, she said. 
Johnson also said the agency has been meeting with resource parents and other stakeholders about short-term homes and other potential supports for the children who would otherwise be housed in alternative settings. She described the first meeting, which was held in the Downeast region, as hopeful and optimistic. The next meeting is scheduled to take place in the Lewiston district. 
Johnson also said the agency is working on a strategic plan to incorporate the suggestions from the lawmakers with state and federal goals that is expected to be complete in the coming months. 
During the presentation, lawmakers also raised the issue of potential cuts in the next federal budget impacting Maine’s child welfare agency.
Rep. Michele Meyer (D-Eliot), who co-chairs the committee, said the potential for “deeply devastating” funding cuts from the federal government to social safety net programs and domestic violence resource centers weighs heavily on her. She said such reductions could have real impacts on the safety and wellbeing of children in Maine. 
Johnson said she’s communicated with the Maine Child Welfare Action Network about how to collaborate and be proactive if those cuts come to fruition.

Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) speaks at the Michigan Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on PreK-12. April 29, 2025 | ScreenshotMichigan Senate Democrats put forward a more than $1 billion funding increase for the state’s public schools Tuesday, with an emphasis on lowering elementary schools’ class sizes.
The plan, introduced by state Sen. Darrin Camilleri , would raise per-pupil funding by $400, from $9,608 to $10,008, with districts required to use 50% of that increase to boost teacher pay. It would also include $2.5 billion in investments for student mental health, a continuation of the program providing free breakfast and lunch for every Michigan public school student, and upgrades for school building infrastructure, including “clean and functional” HVAC systems. 
Camilleri, a former teacher and chair of the Senate PreK-12 Appropriations Subcommittee, said the budget proposal reflects their responsibility to provide students with a safe and supportive high-quality education.
“By investing in mental health resources, modernizing our school facilities, and helping students focus in school through free school meals, we are setting up every child for success. We’re also making critical investments to ensure teachers are paid fairly and classrooms remain small, so that every student gets the attention and support they need to thrive,” Camilleri (D-Trenton) said in a press release.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The plan would increase the School Aid Fund budget by 5%, from the nearly $20.8 billion in Fiscal Year 2025, which ends on Sept. 30, to just over $21.8 billion for the FY26 budget. 
Among the new provisions is $400 million for districts to reduce class sizes in kindergarten through third grade classrooms, which would be paired with a $65 million competitive grant program to do the same.
The budget proposal passed the appropriations subcommittee Tuesday on a party-line 6-1 vote, with majority Democrats in favor. The lone no vote was from the only Republican present, Sen. Thomas Albert who asked why $232 million in incentives for implementation of best practices at low performing schools that had been proposed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in her executive budget recommendation was missing from this plan.
“I actually took that as a positive step to trying to right some of the ways we’ve been approaching education in the state,” Albert (R-Lowell) said.
Camilleri said Democrats remained open to that in budget negotiations, but they believe there is a greater priority for those funds to assist at-risk students.
“We know that many of these school districts that do need additional supports, they need it because they’re dealing with high concentrations of poverty for their student population,” Camilleri responded. “And so investing an additional $258 million in those programs gives school districts the flexibility that they need to lower class sizes, to pay teachers better, and to hopefully invest in those interventions with at-risk funding that we do think can fix some of these systemic educational challenges that our kids face.”
That focus was cheered by Peter Spadafore, executive director of the Michigan Alliance for Student Opportunity, which called the Senate education budget proposal a “significant step forward” in serving at-risk students.
“We are especially encouraged by the proposed 25% increase in the Opportunity Index, which would direct an additional $250 million to schools serving students with the greatest needs. Building upon previous investments, this targeted support will help ensure more equitable opportunities for students across Michigan,” Spadafore said.
The Senate education budget plan sets up a confrontation with the GOP-controlled state House, which has proposed a road funding plan removing the 6% sales tax on gas and instead increasing the motor fuel tax by 20 cents which would be wholly dedicated to funding road upkeep. Currently the motor fuel tax is 31 cents per gallon.
Because more than $700 million a year derived from the gas sales tax goes to the School Aid Fund, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) proposed to replace that lost revenue from the state’s general fund, an idea House Minority Leader Rep. Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) likened to “robbing Peter to pay Paul.”
While Democrats hope to have a state budget plan for schools in place by July 1, which is the start of the fiscal year for most school districts, House Republicans have already passed a $20 billion stopgap spending plan to maintain government services in the event of a government shutdown. That would occur if a state budget is not in place by Oct. 1, the start of the state’s fiscal year.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-29-173224-1024x509.png,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Democrats are slamming policy proposals the Trump administration is reportedly considering that aim to raise birth rates in the United States and encourage women to have children, arguing they should instead enact paid leave and expand the current child tax credit to better support mothers and families.
The debates over family policy come as congressional Republicans hammer out a tax and spending cut bill that could significantly reduce funding for policies and programs focused on supporting women and families.
On Tuesday, the House Democratic Women’s Caucus sent a letter to Trump, shared first with The 19th, expressing their “outrage” that the White House is weighing policy proposals to raise birth rates while implementing sweeping cuts to federal employees and programs that focus on researching fertility and maternal health.
“We write not only as lawmakers, but also as women and mothers who have lived these struggles,” said the letter, signed by Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández of New Mexico, the caucus’ chair, and 38 other House Democratic women lawmakers.
“Many of us have raised children while working full-time, struggled to find and afford child care, navigated high-risk pregnancies, and fought for paid leave and affordable health care,” the letter said. “If you are serious about supporting women and families, we urge you to rescind these proposals and invest in policies that actually meet the needs of women and working families.”
The New York Times reported last week that White House aides have fielded proposals aimed at increasing birth rates and encouraging women to have children. They’ve included reserving a portion of government-sponsored academic scholarships like the Fulbright, which is already selective, for married people and parents; giving a $5,000 “baby bonus” to new mothers; and allocating more government funding for menstrual cycle education and classes. In their letter, the Democratic Women’s Caucus members said “the reported proposals are not only ineffective and out of step with reality, but they also fail to seriously address the challenges of motherhood.”
Social conservatives and Trump have been engaged in a long-standing, if transactional, alliance to limit abortion and promote an ideal of a heterosexual nuclear family. In Trump’s first campaign for the presidency, he promised to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who would vote to end a federal right to abortion.
After the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision in 2022, ending federal abortion rights and sending decisions about it to the states, social conservative activists have turned their focus to limiting the availability of medication abortion and increasing birth rates.
Trump has called himself “the fertilization president” and pledged to make in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment more affordable on the campaign trail, despite some anti-abortion groups’ opposition to IVF. So-called pronatalists, who believe that falling birth rates pose an existential threat to American society, have gotten the ear of the White House. One of the most visible pronatalists is billionaire Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and someone who has fathered over a dozen children and is also a prominent Trump ally.
Trump has told reporters that he thought the baby bonus, which would have to be funded by an act of Congress, was “a good idea.” But Democrats and family policy advocates have panned the proposal as insufficient to support families given the high costs of raising a child.
Republicans also generally oppose increasing spending on social programs. The United States remains one of the only wealthy nations without universal paid leave, and many parents struggle to afford child care. Republicans’ sprawling tax and spending cut agenda could bring cuts to programs including Medicaid, federal food assistance and Head Start, which provides early education services to low-income children. It’s unclear whether the bill will permanently increase the current child tax credit, which was temporarily expanded during the pandemic and has bipartisan support.
“It is estimated parents spend over $20,000 in the first year of a baby’s life,” the letter said. “A $5,000 baby bonus could help families—but mothers deserve support to care for their families, not pressure to grow them.”
Prominent pronatalist advocates Simone and Malcolm Collins have also pitched the White House on bestowing a “National Medal of Motherhood” to women who have six or more children, The Times reported, drawing comparisons to similar medals given out to mothers of multiple children in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia under Joseph Stalin. The Democratic Women’s Caucus letter charged that the idea “is taken directly out of the playbook of authoritarian regimes designed to control women and restrict how families live — it’s appalling.”
Instead, Democratic women said, the Trump administration should support establishing paid leave, making child care more affordable, investing in women’s health research and expanding the child tax credit.
“We are committed to building a country where every woman and every family has the freedom —and the resources—to decide if, when, and how to grow their family,” the letter said. “Women are not mere vessels for childbirth as contemplated in The Handmaid’s Tale.”

Karla Rose Hanson, D-Fargo. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota officials on Tuesday described new legislation as improving “off-ramps” from the criminal justice system, with one of the off-ramps coming before offenders get into the court system. 
“We know that people who get into the criminal justice system tend to stay there,” said Tom Erhardt, director for parole and probation within the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. He said by improving the off-ramps, it will reduce the number of crime victims, reduce the number of repeat offenders and save the state money. 
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Tuesday had a signing ceremony for three criminal justice reform bills, trying to keep people out of the court system, making it easier for them to comply with probation and helping former inmates integrate into society.  
The bills were based in part on a study conducted after the 2023 legislative session and a collaboration with the corrections department and the Department of Health and Human Services.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)
“Given the volume of support from prosecutors, public safety officers, community partners and several state agencies throughout the legislative process, it’s clear that these policies move our criminal justice system in the right direction,” said Rep. Lawrence Klemin, R-Bismarck, the sponsor of the three bills. 
Erhardt said he thinks House Bill 1425, which focuses on diversion and deflection, has the potential to be the most impactful. 
It provides $1 million for a pilot program in three counties to be selected by the corrections department. The county state’s attorney would be able to develop a program focused on keeping people out of jail, using tools such as mental health and substance abuse services. Law enforcement could be part of the deflection process. 
The counties will report back on the pilot program before the start of the 2027 legislative session. 
The bill includes $750,000 through the Department of Health and Human Services for mental health services. 
“We have crisis centers around the state, through our human service centers, where someone can come in and get withdrawal management or detox or get assessed for mental health, they may never have to go to the jail,” said Pam Sagness, executive director of the behavioral health division of HHS. 
House Bill 1417 would eliminate fees for people on supervised release. Not paying those fees can lead to a return to jail. The fees are also seen as a burden for low-income people. 
The corrections department bills about $6 million in supervision fees per biennium with a collection rate of around 25% or $1.5 million.  
Legislative Management may also do a study of court fines and fees before the next legislative session. 
Trio of bills addresses justice reform, crowded North Dakota jails 

The third bill, House Bill 1549, would create a grant program for local jails for programs that help people adjust after being released from jail, referred to as reentry. 
“Most jails don’t have anything set up for reentry,” Colby Braun, director of the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said after the ceremony. “When you’re done, the clothes you came in with, that’s pretty much what you leave with.” 
The corrections department would assist with getting a driver’s license or identification card and getting Medicaid or other assistance through the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The grants from the corrections department would help local jails set up a reentry program.
“So this is really focusing on those local jails to say, ‘Hey, if you guys want to build something up, we’ve got some dollars,’” Braun said. 
The bill also creates a task force to study housing issues for people leaving jail and a possible study of criminal record sealing and expungement. 
The diversion and deflection bill will take effect July 1; the other bills will take effect Aug. 1.

Traci Koster on the House floor on April 29, 2025.The Florida Legislature is sending Gov. Ron DeSantis a bill that would remove the barrier that has kept dozens of wrongfully incarcerated people from receiving the financial compensation that they were entitled to over the past two decades.
That’s because, after several unsuccessful attempts, the House on Tuesday unanimously passed a measure (SB 130) amending a 2008 state law that was designed to provide financial compensation for individuals wrongfully convicted of a crime. The measure previously passed unanimously in the Senate as well.
That 2008 legislation called for eligible exonerees to receive $50,000 for each year they were wrongfully incarcerated, capped at $2 million. However, since its passage, only a handful of exonerees have actually received such compensation, due to a “clean hands” provision barring compensation for people with earlier, unrelated, felonies — the only such restriction of its type in the country.
“Since almost 20 years ago enacting our wrongful incarceration compensation statute, we have 19 exonerees in our state who have lost over 306 years of their freedom, because we as the state of Florida put them in prison,” said Tampa Bay Republican Rep. Traci Koster, who has sponsored this same bill ever since she was elected to the House in 2020.
Koster’s bill (sponsored in the Senate by Northeast Florida Republican Jennifer Bradley) would remove that clean-hands provision. It would extend the filing deadline for those who have been exonerated from 90 days to two years, and allow a wrongfully incarcerated person both to bring a civil lawsuit and file for compensation under the 2008 law.
However, a claimant would have to repay the state if he or she receives monetary awards both through a compensation claim and a civil lawsuit.
In presenting the bill, Koster said she believes  Florida had one of the strongest criminal justice systems “in the world.”
“But just because we have one of the best systems in the world, doesn’t mean it’s perfect,” she added. “And even the best sometimes don’t get it right.”
In making a moral case for the legislation, Volusia County Republican Webster Barnaby cited the case of Joseph in the Bible and former South African President Nelson Mandela as individuals wrongfully incarcerated.
“There are people are wrongfully incarcerated,” he said. “And it’s our job as legislators to be truthful for those poor victims, because that’s what they are, victims, who were wrongfully incarcerated. It’s important for us to see people as people.”
“I’ve been here seven years and I’ve watched people come trying to get compensation, and it’s been a very, very difficult task,” said Tampa Democratic Rep. Dianne Hart. “When we incarcerate somebody for 35 or 40 years of their life, there is no compensation that can compensate for the time that they have spent for being incarcerated.”
91 people
Since 1989, 91 people in Florida have been exonerated or released from incarceration as a result of post-conviction DNA testing, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. That includes Robert DuBoise, who served 37 years on rape and murder charges but was exonerated in 2020 by the Conviction Review Unit of the Hillsborough County State Attorney’s Office after DNA evidence testing excluded him as the perpetrator.
However, the clean-hands provision of state law precluded him from being eligible for compensation because of two nonviolent property felony crimes which resulted in probation when he was a teenager. He ended up suing the city of Tampa in federal court in 2021 and, ultimately, the city council approved a $14 million settlement for him in 2024.

(Courtesy of Courtnie Washington)A state grand jury has decided not to indict the Jersey City police officer who shot and killed a man in psychiatric crisis in 2023, the state Attorney General’s Office announced Tuesday.
Andrew Washington, 52, died on Aug. 27, 2023, after authorities sent police to his home in riot gear who pounded on his door, broke it down after a brief standoff, and then shot him with a gun and Taser when he rushed out the door armed with a knife. Washington’s family had called a mental-health hotline for help.
The police’s response flouted departmental de-escalation protocols and violated Washington’s civil rights, his family said in a wrongful death lawsuit they filed last year.
Grand jurors voted Monday not to criminally charge Officer Stephen Gigante, the “trained negotiator” who fired the fatal shots, after reviewing a 911 call, body-worn camera footage, witness interviews, photographs, ballistics reports, and autopsy results, the Attorney General’s Office said.
Washington had several mental health disabilities, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and bouts of psychosis that involved auditory hallucinations, his family said in their lawsuit, which remains ongoing. They called a mental health hotline because they wanted him to go to the hospital, they said.
Responding officers reported that Washington, communicating through his closed door, referred to a “suicide mission” and seeing ghosts, refused to talk with EMTs, and then went silent altogether, spurring supervisors’ decision to breach the door, according to the Attorney General’s Office. When the officers did, Washington ran at them with a 13-inch knife, the office said.
Attorney Amelia Green, who represents Washington’s family, said they were disappointed by the grand jury’s decision. But the decision does not exonerate the officers, Green added.
“We will prove these officers violated Drew’s constitutional rights in multiple ways when they shot and killed him when he was in the midst of a mental health episode,” Green said in a statement. “Drew’s death is the result of ongoing systemic failures by the Jersey City Police Department in its interactions with those with mental health disabilities. The grand jury’s decision only makes the family’s civil rights lawsuit all the more important in holding the Jersey City Police Department accountable for Drew’s death.”
Washington’s slaying came just five months after Paterson police gunned down community activist Najee Seabrooks after a similar standoff in March 2023. That incident drove the state to take over the Paterson police force. A grand jury decided in March not to indict two officers for Seabrooks’ death.
Both deaths and resulting community protests prompted state Attorney General Matt Platkin to amend the statewide use-of-force policy in encounters involving people in mental crisis and expand a statewide program that pairs police with trained mental health professionals to handle such calls.

(Screenshot courtesy of C-Span)A federal bill that would require social media platforms to remove falsified intimate images and so-called “revenge porn,” which a South Carolina state legislator has been pushing for, advanced to the president’s desk Monday.
State Rep. Brandon Guffey has repeatedly called on Congress to pass legislation protecting children online after his 17-year-old son, Gavin Guffey, died by suicide three years ago while being extorted with intimate photos he had shared by direct message on Instagram.
Guffey, R-Rock Hill, recounted the story of his son’s suicide to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year during a general discussion about protections for children online. The bill passed the House with a vote of 409-2 on Monday.
SC House passes bill requiring parental consent for social media

Every South Carolina representative in Congress voted for the bill, which will go to President Donald Trump for his signature.
“I think that’s a big first step,” Guffey told the SC Daily Gazette.
The bill, dubbed the TAKE IT DOWN Act, is among several for which Guffey has been advocating. Another federal proposal that would make social media platforms legally responsible for protecting children on their apps and websites from sexual exploitation has yet to get a vote in either chamber.
The passage of the first proposal could lead to others, Guffey said.
“Hopefully it’ll begin that snowball,” Guffey said.
In recent years, the state has put in place some of its own protections for children online. Gavin’s Law, named after Guffey’s son, passed in 2023, banning sexual extortion, also known as “sextortion.”
Several other proposals have advanced but not reached the finish line, including a bill requiring children to get permission from their parents before creating social media profiles that passed the House earlier this year.
A Senate committee Tuesday advanced a proposal to ban intimate photos circulated without a person’s consent, dubbed revenge porn, as well as fake nude photos. The bill, which passed the House unanimously, will go to the Senate floor.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-16-1024x576.png,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

Colorado had a 4.5% increase in births last year, the largest in the nation, as births increased nationally for the first time since 2021. (Photo courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.



Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

,DC,2025-04-29 20:59:50+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House GOP starts reconciliation work with increase for border security,"Ariana Figueroa, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-starts-reconciliation-work-increase-border-security,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans on Tuesday kicked off their work to build consensus on “one big, beautiful bill,” to fund President Donald Trump 's priorities, including a major funding boost for immigration enforcement and border security. After returning from a two-week recess, House lawmakers started debating and amending the various sections of the bill with markups in the Armed Services, Education and Workforce, and Homeland Security committees.Congressional Republicans are using reconciliation — a special procedure that skirts the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — to put together one bill to fulfill the White House’s priorities on border security, tax cuts, energy policy and defense.The Homeland panel’s bill, which would increase funding for border security by $70 billion, aligns with Trump’s second-term agenda, which has centered on an immigration crackdown.The Homeland Security portion of the reconciliation package recommends $46.5 billion to construct a barrier along U.S. borders and $5 billion for Customs and Border Protection facilities, including $4.1 billion to hire 3,000 Border Patrol agents and 5,000 CBP officers. It would also set aside $2 billion for retention and signing bonuses for CBP staff.  “It is critical that the Republican majority do what the people elected us to do, approve funds for effective border security and enforcement measures,” House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green of Tennessee said.The bill also includes $2.7 billion in technology surveillance along U.S. borders and roughly $1 billion for inspection technology at ports of entry. The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said Democrats were unified in their opposition to the proposal. He argued that roughly $70 billion in funding would only aid the Trump administration in its plans of mass deportation and not address border security.“House Republican leadership is putting lipstick on this pig of a reconciliation package by pretending it’s about border security,” Thompson said.Votes on all three committees' bills, and amendments mostly from Democrats raising objections to the package, were expected late Tuesday or after midnight Wednesday. The committees are not expected to adopt any of the Democratic amendments.Summer floor votesSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Tuesday he expects the House will spend the rest of this week and next week debating the 11 different bills in committee before rolling them all into one reconciliation package.The full House will debate and vote to approve the legislation before Memorial Day, under the current timeline.“I don’t know how long the Senate is going to take to do their piece,” Johnson said. “But I was very encouraged after the meeting yesterday, frankly. Leader (John) Thune and Sen. (Mike) Crapo are on point. The Senate Republicans have been working very hard together.”Thune, of South Dakota, is the Senate majority leader and Crapo, of Idaho, chairs the tax-writing Finance Committee.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the administration would like the package to clear Congress before the Fourth of July, though Johnson said he “hopes” to finalize a deal before that deadline.Thune said later Tuesday that the reconciliation package’s final look will be decided by what policies have the votes to get through each chamber.“Ultimately, what gets included in a reconciliation bill will be determined by what there are 218 votes for in the House and 51, or 50, votes for in the United States Senate,” Thune said.Democrats object to deportationsDemocrats on the Homeland Security panel introduced amendments to signal their opposition to the administration's deportation agenda.Louisiana Rep. Troy Carter was one of several Democrats to sharply criticize the recent deportation of three U.S. citizen children to Honduras during the Homeland Security Committee’s markup.He noted that one of the children removed with his mother to Honduras, is a 4-year-old battling Stage 4 cancer.“This is not border security,” Carter said. “This is state-sanctioned trauma.Democrats introduced amendments to bar federal funds being used to detain immigrants at a foreign prison, following an agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador to detain more than 300 men in a notorious mega-prison. Experts have raised concerns the agreement could violate a law against funding foreign governments engaged in human rights abuses.“This is not an idle possibility,"" Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island said.He pointed out that Trump asked El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele to consider taking “homegrown” criminals, meaning U.S. citizens.“This is insane,” Magaziner said. “It is outrageous and every American should be terrified by this prospect.”Several other Democrats introduced amendments related to the Trump administration’s use of the prison in El Salvador.Boost for PentagonThe House Armed Services Committee portion of the reconciliation package would bolster defense spending by $150 billion over the next decade.That funding would be divvied up between numerous national security priorities, including $25 billion for Trump’s goal of having a countrywide missile defense system, similar to Israel's Iron Dome.The defense bill would appropriate $34 billion for shipbuilding and the maritime industrial base, $21 billion for munitions purchases, $14 billion for “initiatives to scale production of game changing new technology,” $13 billion for nuclear deterrence and $12 billion to enhance military readiness, according to a GOP summary of that bill. Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., said at the beginning of his committee's markup that the bill would make a “generational investment in our national security.”“It is clear we are no longer deterring our adversaries,” Rogers said. “The threats we face today from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea and others, are much more serious and challenging than we have ever faced before.”Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, ranking member on the panel, said there’s “no question that the Department of Defense has needs and there's also no question that we as a country face threats.”But Smith criticized Republicans for moving the defense funding boost within the massive reconciliation package, which will increase the deficit.“We’re, once again, saying to the American people, ‘This is important but not important enough to actually pay for it.’ So the budget itself is a huge problem,” Smith said. “And you really can’t support the additional $150 billion for defense if you don’t support the overall reconciliation bill because that’s what this is. And the overall reconciliation bill, I firmly believe, is a disaster for this country.”Smith criticized Republicans for proposing additional dollars for the Pentagon while it is run by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is under investigation for sending information about a bombing campaign in Yemen to a group chat that inadvertently included a journalist and a different group chat that included his wife, brother and others.“They have not even begun to prove that there is a chance in hell that they will spend this money intelligently, efficiently and effectively,” Smith said. “Secretary Hegseth has proven himself to be completely incapable of doing the job of secretary of Defense.”Cuts for Pell grantsThe Education and Workforce Committee’s markup fell along similar partisan lines, with GOP lawmakers lauding the bill and Democrats rejecting Republicans’ plans seeking to overhaul federal spending.Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., said the legislation would cut $330 billion in federal spending over the next decade by reshaping federal student loan programs and Pell grants for low-income students, among several other changes.“Dumping more federal money into a broken system doesn’t mean that system will work,” Walberg said. “In fact, government spending on higher education has reached record highs, yet millions of students benefiting from those funds will ultimately end up with a degree that doesn’t pay off or fail to finish school altogether.”The GOP bill, he said, would “bring much-needed reform in three key areas: simplified loan repayment, streamlined student loan options, and accountability for students and taxpayers.”Walberg scolded former President Joe Biden for not working with Congress to overhaul federal grant and loan programs for higher education, saying the former administration “was determined to keep pouring taxpayer funds into the abyss in a futile attempt to keep up with the unacceptable and unaccountable institutional prices.”Virginia Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member, said that Congress should look at ways to make college more affordable through reforms, but said the GOP bill “misses the mark.”“This current reconciliation plan would increase costs for colleges and students. It would limit students access to quality programs, which would then reduce their likelihood of finding a rewarding or successful career,” Scott said. “And then take the so-called savings to pay for more tax cuts for the wealthy and the well-connected.”Republicans “limiting the students' access to Pell grants and federal loans,” he said, could increase the number of people who have to rely on “predatory, private loans” to pay for college.“Put bluntly: The Republican plan will limit how much money middle- and low-income students can borrow from the federal government,” Scott said. “As a result, limiting the federal student aid that students can receive means that millions of students will not be able to access federal assistance that they need to complete their degrees. Moreover, this bill will force student borrowers into unaffordable repayment plans.”",,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 20:58:48+00:00,CT Mirror,"After 100 days of Trump, CT Democrats know where they stand",Mark Pazniokas and Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/trump-first-100-days-ct-lawmakers/,CT Democrats say President Trump’s performance is actually worse than his dismal polling reflects. Republicans say it’s too early to judge.,"In Connecticut, Democrats lined up Tuesday to say President Donald J. Trump’s performance actually is worse than his dismal polling reflects, while Republicans say it is too early to judge one of the most consequential starts to a new administration since Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s first 100 days in 1933.
Gov. Ned Lamont contrasted FDR’s efforts to calm a nation rocked by the Great Depression with Trump’s destabilization of a solid economy with a trade war on America’s closest allies, unpredictable shifts on tariffs and the threat of deep federal budget cuts and layoffs.
“People are scared. People are holding back. We’re going the wrong way, driving the economy into a ditch, as opposed to ‘The only thing you have the fear is fear itself.’ You might as well say, ‘If you’re scared today, just wait ’til tomorrow,’” Lamont said.
A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that twice as many people gave Trump a failing grade of F as gave him an A, and a Gallup assessment of first 100 days polling going back to Harry Truman found Trump’s approval rating was 42%. Only Trump’s first-term mark of 41% was lower.
Lamont spoke outside the state Capitol, joined by the Democratic state chair, Roberto Alves, and Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas, Comptroller Sean Scanlon, Treasurer Erick Russell and Attorney General William Tong.
Republicans, mindful that Trump has lost badly in Connecticut in each of his three runs for the White House, staged no similar event in Hartford, though the state GOP chair, Ben Proto, and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, offered varying degrees of praise, or at least calls for patience, when called for comment.
“I start with promises made, promise kept,” Proto said. “That’s one of the biggest problems the Democrats have: They are going to have to start keeping promises.”
In Proto’s view, Trump has accomplished what he promised: controlling the southern border and taking steps to deport migrants in the U.S. without legal status, especially those implicated in crimes.
“I think there is good and bad with President Trump,” Candelora said. “He certainly controlled the border crossing. He is trying to address the immigration crisis, trying to reposition our manufacturing bases in the country with his tariffs. I think it’s too early to say whether he is successful. I think he is taking a path that brings a lot of anxiety.”
Candelora said he was not supportive of the president’s calls for the impeachment of judges who have issued adverse rulings in challenges to executive orders and expressed a wariness about Trump’s withholding federal funding from universities that have displeased him.
But Candelora said he resented the challenges from Democrats for Republicans to stand up to the president, saying they are “gaslighting” Republicans with exaggerated claims of how the initial cuts have impacted federal services or its aid to state governments.
“I have an assessment of the first 100 days of the Connecticut Democrats, and that is they have completely lost their minds, and they wouldn’t know the truth if it hit them in the face,” Candelora said.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, held a press conference Tuesday to criticize Lamont for agreeing to a deal that will remove Connecticut State Colleges and Universities Chancellor Terrence Cheng from his leadership post but allow him to collect his base annual salary of $442,187 until his contract expires next year.
Harding offered no assessment of Trump, but he had plenty to say about Lamont tolerating Cheng’s controversial wining and dining expenses. The governor should have pressed the Board of Regents to fire Cheng for cause, he said.
“We’re focusing on the things that we actually can control here in the state,” Harding said. “The governor can do something about this. The governor can turn around and tell the Board of Regents, ‘No, do not offer an extension on this contract. We’re going to fire this individual.’”
Scanlon, the Democratic comptroller whose office audited Cheng at Lamont’s request, said Harding should be able to comment directly on Trump, who is provoking a constitutional crisis with his use of executive powers, even when contradicted by federal law.
“I think it’s important that we talk about that. It’s not apples for apples. Here we are acting on this situation,” Scanlon said of Cheng. “That situation has been dealt with. The governor asked me to do an audit of that gentleman, and that audit, I think, bore out as to why they decided not to re-up his contract with them.”
In Washington, Republicans praised the president.
House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said he spoke twice with Trump ahead of the president’s big speech Tuesday night in Michigan to celebrate his first 100 days. Johnson argued Republicans’ electoral wins gave them the leverage and authority to reshape parts of the federal government and the ways in which they are trying to address inflation and immigration.
“We got a mandate to do exactly what we’re doing right now. We have not wasted a moment,” Johnson said at the Republican National Committee’s headquarters that sits a few blocks away from the U.S. Capitol.
He acknowledged some of the challenges facing the administration when pressed about the recent drops in Trump’s approval rating. Johnson believes there will be an eventual payoff of Trump’s tit-for-tat tariff policies that have led to market volatility.
“There’s been a little question and concern about the rocky start — some of the stock market, some of the tariff policy and all that,” Johnson said. “But right now, even today, people are beginning to see the dust settle on that. They understand there was a master strategy behind this, and they’re seeing the results.”
While the strategy may be a slower burn, Republicans believe Americans will see the promised results when they hash out and pass their major tax package, which is currently still in the beginning stages. They are promising relief for families and entertaining proposals like no taxes on tips. But they will also need to reckon with not further driving up the deficit and making enough spending cuts that could possibly lead to disruptions in some programs.
Johnson and his leadership team also took some shots at the Democratic Party, which had initially struggled to respond to Trump amid an onslaught of executive orders. Some Democrats, like U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, have openly criticized the party for not addressing the concerns of working families. Republicans believe they are still operating without a message.
“They don’t have any message. They don’t have any clear leader. They don’t have a clear vision. They don’t know what to do. Their platform has been repudiated, and they’re turning on themselves,” Johnson said, noting that one of the vice chairs of the Democratic National Committee will fund primary challenges against some incumbents in safe blue seats. 
Republicans call it obstruction. Democrats see it as a renewed resistance movement.
And Democrats argue they have now found their footing since Trump took office in January.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., sees a big change in the energy over the past 100 days. The mood was “despairing and despondent” at earlier town halls, but he said things feel differently whether it was at his weekend town hall in Middletown or at an event in Michigan.
“People are ready to go on offense. We need to do more than just attack Trump,” Blumenthal said Tuesday from Washington. “What I saw in the town halls and the reaction from people generally is disgust and anger.”
Members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation have held town halls and events over the past few months to hear out constituents. And in other states and districts that aren’t getting facetime with their members, Murphy, who has become one of Democrats’ go-to messengers, has sought to fill in the gaps and hold town halls in red states with his colleagues.
Connecticut, like every other state, has grappled with swift changes coming out of the White House — and the occasional walkback of some policies. Within a week of Trump taking office, his administration planned to pause all federal grants and loans. That was ultimately reversed, though the short-lived policy had a lingering effect and caused delays for some sectors.
Since then, other federal funding streams have started to see cuts or completely disappear, whether for food banks, public health agencies or universities. That has led Tong to join multiple lawsuits looking to block a number of those actions.
Cuts to federal funding mean states like Connecticut will likely need to fill in the gaps if programs and services are at risk.

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)Iowa’s public universities and community colleges would see flat funding for the upcoming fiscal year if proposed education appropriation legislation is passed, causing concern for some lawmakers.
Senate Study Bill 1231 would set fiscal year 2026 state funding for the Iowa Department of Education, Iowa Board of Regents and the institutions it governs, Department for the Blind and other individual programs.
Under the bill, general university funding for the University of Iowa would stay at almost $223.5 million, Iowa State University funding would remain at more than $178.4 million and funding for the University of Northern Iowa would remain at almost $101.9 million.
While neither the University of Iowa or Iowa State University requested any general funding increases, the University of Northern Iowa asked for an additional $2.5 million for the upcoming year, which was not reflected in the bill.

Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, said Tuesday during a subcommittee meeting on the bill that data from the board of regents shows around 66% of the higher education system budget is driven by tuition, with less than 30% made up of state appropriations.
“I’m very concerned about the level funding for both our community colleges and our regent universities,” Winckler said. “That would mean, as costs are going up for the provision of education, that tuition will go up, and in many cases, that is very difficult for families.”
Public education is incredibly important, she said, and when the Legislature keeps funding flat for state universities and community colleges — especially with national challenges all colleges must weather — the students and families paying to attend them feel the hurt of rising costs.
Funding for community colleges is listed at close to $235.9 million, the same as last year. Katrina Holck, representing Community Colleges for Iowa, said many community colleges are concerned  about the proposed funding as well.
Lobbyists expressed general support for the legislation during the meeting, including proposed funding of $10 million for a health care professional incentive program and more than $2.3 million for the therapeutic classroom incentive fund for school districts.
Representatives of Des Moines University said in the past, the private college and the UI have been allocated funds for a loan program to either keep alumni practicing in Iowa or bring professionals back to the state to work, and expressed their wish to see it continue.
“The loan program has been really helpful for our alumni to stay here and practice or come back and practice in rural areas,” said Joseph Jones, chief of staff in the president’s office at DMU.
Other funds left out of the legislation mentioned by commenters included the Iowa Tuition Grant program, $14 million for paraeducators and other civil work personnel and a $335,000 ask for a dyslexia endorsement tuition reimbursement program.
Subcommittee chair Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, said in total, the bill allocates more than $1 billion from the state general fund for fiscal year 2026, an increase of more than $7 million from last year, as well as about $33.7 million from other funds.
Sen. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, had no comments but joined Green in signing the legislation forward. It will head to the full Senate Appropriations Committee for further review.
Green praised Gov. Kim Reynolds for urging the Legislature to allocate $1 million to the UI for cancer research, as well as the health care professional incentive program. In speaking with his constituents about actions taken last year to increase starting teacher pay, Green said it has really helped rural teachers and schools, and similar efforts should continue.
“This year, when I have gone out and I’ve talked to the communities, it resonates with a lot of people that we need to maybe expand our rural teacher loan incentives,” Green said. “That’s something that I would like to continue to pursue in the future, for me personally.”

Patrick Morrisey signed a pair of education bills that will ban the use of cellphones in classrooms and require teachers to display “In God We Trust” in schools. 
Students, Republican lawmakers and others joined the governor at Lincoln Middle School in Shinnston, West Virginia, on Tuesday for a bill signing ceremony.
Morrisey prioritized banning cellphones in schools, mentioning it in his State of the State address. It was the only piece of education legislation that the governor requested in his first legislative session.
“I think this is going to make a significant difference for our teachers and students,” Morrisey said. “We know that the use of personal electronic devices in the classroom increases distractions, academic misconduct and bullying and, overall, it creates a negative learning environment.”
Morrisey also mentioned that the bill would help curtail students’ addiction to cellphones that could harm their mental health. 
House Bill 2003, which overwhelmingly passed the House of Delegates and Senate, prohibits students from using a personal electronic device during instructional time. County boards of education are required to create and adopt a policy that includes whether cellphones are permitted on school grounds and what the consequence would be for students who violate the policy. 
If a county board decides that cellphones will be permitted on school property, students may be required to store the devices in containers or pouches provided by the county board, according to the bill. 
  Sen . Jay Taylor, R-Taylor
“The kids throughout the state had influence on this bill and helped work it. That’s incredible,” said Sen. Jay Taylor, R-Taylor. “Don’t take this as, ‘We don’t want you to use cellphones.’ We want you to learn to use them responsibly.”
Morrisey also signed Senate Bill 280, which requires public schools and higher education institutions to display a durable poster or framed copy of the United States motto, “In God We Trust.”
Sen. Mike Azinger, R-Wood, has sponsored the measure for three years.
“First of all I want to give honor to God for this bill. It tells Americans and kids … what our U.S. motto is,” Azinger said. “If America stays with that motto in our hearts and West Virginia stays with that motto in our hearts, we’ll be OK.”
  Sen. Mike Azinger, R-Wood
The display must contain a representation of the United States flag centered under the national motto and cannot have any other words or images.
It didn’t come with funding for schools to purchase the signage, but schools can accept private donations for the now-required display. 
“We have to ensure that we’re teaching kids about the founding principals of our country — a true and accurate retailing of civics and American life and history,” Morrisey said.
Morrisey noted the state’s near-bottom ranking in student academic performance and teacher pay.
“We’re not going to get where we need to be without having every West Virginia child having the ability to access a top-notch education system,” he said.  
Session ends without teacher pay raises
During his State of the State address, Morrisey called for teacher pay raises as West Virginia’s public school teachers are the least paid in the nation. But the governor didn’t request a bill to implement a pay increase. 
A bill sponsored by Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, sought to implement “locality pay” for teachers. It would have determined their potential raise by the median home prices in their county. The bill failed to make it to the full Senate for consideration.
Morrisey already signed lawmakers’ high-profile education measure that will give elementary teachers more authority to remove disruptive or violent students from their classroom. The measure is in response to West Virginia teachers’ call for help in addressing an uptick in elementary students’ violent and dangerous behavior that has resulted in teacher injuries and learning disruptions. 
The bill also mandates that school mental health professionals assess removed students to see what could be causing the behavior. 
Additionally, Morrisey signed lawmakers’ budget that includes $97 million in funding for the state’s education voucher program, the Hope Scholarship, that has a quickly-accelerating price tag. Lawmakers have already raised concerns about how the state will afford the program next year with its estimated price tag of $300 million. 
Morrisey has until the end of day Wednesday to sign the remaining bills.

The House passed House Resolution 34, which is in support of Montana beef producers, while down the hall, the Senate moved House Resolution 52 forward, which continues the discussion of a checkoff, or marketing and education program, for Treasure State cattle products.
HJ 34 was brought by Rep. Randyn Gregg, R-White Sulphur Springs, while HJ 52 was sponsored by Rep. Eric Tilleman, R-Cascade.
“I moo that this bill do pass,” Gregg said on the House floor.
His wasn’t the only bit of humor, as Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, asked Rep. Bob Carter, a Missoula Democrat and a vice chair of the House Agriculture committee, about the bill.
“I just wanted to ask,” Zolnikov said. “Are you ‘mooved’ by this bill?”
The resolution calls for sustainable beef production and encourages state and federal governments “to prioritize policies that ensure fair market conditions,” and remove regulatory burdens.
The resolution also “strongly opposes” lab-grown meat, which the Montana Legislature voted to ban earlier this session with House Bill 401, currently on the governor’s desk.
As of January 2025, there were 1.2 million beef cows in Montana and, additionally, about 1 million calves in the state. Agriculture in Montana is a $6.5 billion industry. 
Tilleman’s bill would study ways to grow that, following up on a somewhat controversial checkoff marketing legislation, HB 119, that was tabled in the Senate Agriculture fCommittee earlier this session. The bill would have created the Montana Cattle Committee and asked about 9,600 beef producers across the state, through a vote, whether or not they wanted to be taxed per head of cattle for the program.
“We decided to do a study bill to where we can get it ironed out, make it work for everybody,” Tilleman told the Daily Montanan. “Because we know our beef in Montana is some of the best, and everybody keeps buying.”
That idea was based on the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee, which was established in 1967 to promote Treasure State versions of those products. That committee works with the Wheat Marketing Center in Portland, Oregon, Tilleman said.
“They’ll actually take our wheat from Montana,” Tilleman said. “And they design special dishes for each of the different countries to try to show that our wheat is the best.”
If the Montana Cattle Committee is created in a future session, that’s the direction Tilleman hopes it goes. HJ 52 will also target educational opportunities. 
Tilleman is the Office of Public Instruction’s agricultural education specialist and sees it first hand. In Kalispell, for example, there’s six agriculture teachers with around 600 students. Tilleman said about two-thirds of schools in the state have some sort of agricultural education.
“There’s a big push in our area for that,” Tilleman said.
Several bills have touched on livestock this session, including increased financial protections for goat and bison producers. 
House Bill 356, which is on its way to the governor’s desk, added black bears to a predation list. It allows livestock producers, through the Livestock Loss Board, to receive compensation for animals killed by black bears. The list was previously grizzly bears, mountain lions and wolves.
“We have a lot of good bills that we’re trying to kind of rectify some of our code and try to actually help mitigate livestock loss,” Tilleman said. “And that was the big ones I was pushing, is being able to use those dollars to help mitigate a little more and doing that education.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/52100786614_9103ba001a_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Getty Images)On April 28, the president issued an executive order titled “Protecting American Communities from Criminal Aliens.” The order on its face is a screed against so-called sanctuary cities. It directs the attorney general to compile a list of sanctuary jurisdictions around the U.S. and, among other things, threatens to withhold federal funding from them. To me, an attorney in a city with a long, proud history of welcoming and protecting people from all over the world, the executive order reads like a temper tantrum. 
There isn’t a universal definition for a sanctuary city. The term refers to a non-federal jurisdiction — it could be a state, a county, or a city or town — that has laws in place that limit its government’s cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Communities choose these policies for a variety of reasons: to build trust and cooperation between officials and non-citizens; to maintain discretion of how to allocate limited law enforcement resources for public safety; and because they don’t want to be in the business of hunting down their neighbors for deportation.
Trump administration officials assert that sanctuary policies make our communities less safe. They point to highly publicized murders of American citizens at the hands of non-citizens and they allege the presence of transnational criminal organizations and terrorists in our communities. But research bears out that places with sanctuary policies have lower crime rates than places without them. Sanctuary policies encourage participation in community policing by all members of the community and engagement with social services and community and economic development initiatives that mitigate poverty.
The most recent executive order asserts that sanctuary policies are  “lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government’s obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States.” The Trump administration may feel that way — so many of its recent executive orders are more about feelings than what is actually legal — but courts have consistently held otherwise. 
Sanctuary policies do not explicitly interfere with immigration enforcement. They do not impede the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to arrest, detain and deport non-citizens and they do not shield or harbor those individuals from law enforcement. Refusing to cooperate within this legal framework does not prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other federal agencies from doing their job; it just says: We’re not going to use our resources to do this job for you. 
This distinction is important because it is constitutionally protected. The 10th amendment has what’s called the “anti-commandeering” doctrine. What that means is that the federal government cannot conscript states and local governments to enforce federal laws. Courts have long held that sanctuary policies are protected by the 10th amendment. 
This is why the Trump administration is attempting to use withholding of federal funds to compel jurisdictions with sanctuary policies to comply and cooperate. It’s not unlike the threats to withhold federal funding from universities who are unwilling to bend the knee to the administration. But, with respect to sanctuary cities, this issue was litigated during the first Trump administration and a federal judge ruled against withholding funds saying: “Federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the President disapproves.” That same judge granted an injunction on April 24 against the Trump administration’s attempt to withhold funds from sanctuary cities.  
This explains the tantrum. Kinder people can call it political theater but it is just a tantrum. We are starting to see a pattern of the president lashing out at people, companies, universities, states, or even countries that don’t immediately bend the knee to his demands. Mass deportation is a marquis issue for the second Trump administration and whether threatening sanctuary jurisdictions, denying due process or ignoring court orders, officials are having to result in increasingly illegal strategies to implement it. As desperation grows, the administration is escalating baseless propaganda about non-citizens being heinous criminals or terrorists. Sanctuary jurisdictions have a legally protected right to stand up and say, ‘we don’t buy it.’ Sanctuary jurisdictions know what healthy and safe communities look like, which is why voters support the policies. 
There are challenges ahead for our leaders. In our sanctuary communities, we need to lean into the instincts that told us we will never be safer by throwing our neighbors under the bus and stand up with other cities against these threats. We know we are always stronger together, that’s why we passed sanctuary policies in the first place. And the law is on our side. We refuse to cooperate with the federal government’s orders to help detain and deport our neighbors and we must also refuse to back down as the threats escalate — no matter how angry it makes our tantrum-throwing president.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-924927966-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)The Florida House has passed a measure (SB 118) that bans local governments in the state from interfering with any plans to construct a presidential library in Florida.
The motivation for the legislation comes from Florida Republicans who want to ease the pathway for a library for Donald Trump to be built in the Sunshine State.
“As the home to the 45th and 47th president of the United States, there is a high likelihood that President Trump will select Florida to be the site of his presidential library,” Central Florida Republican Jason Brodeur told the Senate Committee on Community Affairs back in February when he first introduced the measure.
“In anticipation of Florida’s first presidential library, we should roll out the welcome mat and offer the president maximum flexibility to construct this historic landmark here in Florida.”
In the House vote on Tuesday, two Democrats were dismissive.
“Please just vote on this bill. That is my debate,” said Orlando Democrat Anna Eskamani succinctly. 
The other Democrat who spoke out, Jacksonville Rep. Angie Nixon, blasted the entire notion, saying that there was “irony” in what the GOP-controlled chamber was doing.
“If we are going to support bringing this library here, we should support returning citizens all across the board, and not attack returning citizens, especially when they want to do things like vote, because we have one of the biggest returning citizens a/k/a felons in the administration right now,” she said referring to Trump being found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments in May 2024 in a New York courtroom.
Nixon’s comment about returning citizens was a reference to the 2018 constitutional amendment which legalized felons in Florida who had completed their sentence to be able to vote. However, an implementing bill in the following legislative session significantly narrowed the number of felons who can actually vote.
Not all Democrats were that critical, as five of them joined all Republicans in supporting the measure (the final vote was 89-20).
Associates of Trump have been looking  at several South Florida universities as possible locations for a presidential library, including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University, the Associated Press reported last month.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Not without conflict, the Florida Senate took up 189 of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees for boards and commissions across the state and approved all of them. 
Among the confirmations was former House Speaker Paul Renner to the State University System Board of Governors, former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez as chair of Space Florida, and former Sen. Rob Bradley to the St. Johns River Water Management District board. 
Two appointees, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Chair Rodney Barreto and Board of Education member Daniel Foganholi, received pushback but ultimately were confirmed. 
Senators approved Foganholi by a three-vote margin, 20-17. 
Foganholi has been appointed to four positions by DeSantis, including two times to the Broward School District board. In November, he ran to keep his spot on that board and lost, receiving 20% of the vote. 
New Board of Education member thanks God, DeSantis for fourth appointment

After the loss, DeSantis appointed him to the state board. 
“The people of Broward County did not trust Mr. Foganholi to represent them and he should not be rewarded for his failure to win the confidence of his community with a higher appointment to the State Board of Education,” Sen. Tina Polsky said on the floor.
Foganholi, a first-generation American born to parents who came to the United States from Brazil, is a member of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, to which DeSantis appointed him.
Miami New Times reported in August that Foganholi used to be a rapper. He told the outlet that he is proud of his music venture, but not of the music itself, which includes him “spitting bars about everything from getting women to getting high,” according to the New Times. 
Foganholi appeared in a music video that includes a depiction of him robbing a convenience store with a gun, the outlet reported, and published a screenshot of the YouTube video. The video linked in the article has since been deleted.
Polsky brought his rap career up on the floor.
“This is not the influence we need on our State Board of Education. We owe our children better,” Polsky said. 
Foganholi wrote an op-ed in support of gun open carry on campus following the shooting at Florida State University that killed two and injured six. 
“At FSU, the shooter used his mother’s legally-owned service weapon,” Foganholi wrote in The Spectator. “No law could have stopped him. But, had even one trained professor, staff member or responsible student been armed, this tragedy might have ended differently.”
He went on to write a similar sentiment about the 2017 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Polsky, who represents Parkland, site of the high school, said Foganholi misrepresented what happened that day in his op-ed, adding that he is “either so ignorant on our state’s tragedies or so willing to deliberately misrepresent them to promote his own agenda.”
“The students of Florida, of Parkland, and now of Florida State, continue to come to us, asking us to listen and prioritize their safety,” Polsky said. “How do we justify them appointing someone with such a poor understanding of safety on the Board of Education.”
More money more problems
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith requested that Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Chair Rodney Barreto be removed from the consent list. 
Barreto, a Coral Gables resident, has been appointed to the commission by three different governors — Jeb Bush, Charlie Crist, and DeSantis. Barreto is a millionaire who owns property in four states and chaired the Miami Super Bowl Host Committee three times.
Smith said his and other senators’ email inboxes “have been blown up” by constituents concerned about Barreto.
During his Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources confirmation hearing earlier this year, Barreto was asked about submerged land he owns at Singer Island and the potential sale of the environmentally sensitive land.
“I’m not in the business of buying land and giving it to people,” he said at the time when asked about the sale. “I’m in the business of making money.”
Smith recalled that testimony on the Senate floor Tuesday.
“Of course, there’s nothing wrong with making money. It’s not a crime or a bad thing. It’s what makes our capitalist economic system work. But he didn’t strike me as an environmental advocate, certainly not someone who should be the chair of the Florida Wildlife Commission.
“In my opinion, Mr. Barreto’s personal financial and development interests directly conflict with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s mission,” Smith said.
But Sens. Ana Maria Rodriguez and Bryan Avila defended Barreto.
“I know that there’s a lot of noise and I think it’s important for us to sometimes put the noise aside and look at the accomplishments and look at the individual who has been leading the effort not just on Biscayne Bay not just on the Everglades but on preserving a lot of land in our state for conservation,” Avila said.
The Senate voted 31-7 to confirm Barreto.
Not everyone confirmed
The Senate did not vote on all of DeSantis appointees. 
Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris or Department of Children and Families Secretary Taylor Hatch were not confirmed. The Florida Phoenix was the first to report that the Senate wouldn’t confirm them. Both Harris and Hatch testified during the House of Representatives investigation into a $10 million payment to the Hope Florida Foundation by health care giant Centene. The payment was part of a Medicaid overpayment settlement Centene reached with the state.
One University of West Florida trustee, Adam Kissel, was rejected in committee.
If the governor wants Harris, Hatch, or Kissel to continue to serve, he must reappoint them to that post within days of the end of session. They can continue to serve until the next legislative session. Appointees who fail to win confirmation a second time must leave their positions.
Two other gubernatorial appointees to the UWF board resigned after senators showed hesitancy about DeSantis’ desired conservative makeover of the Pensacola institution. 
New process
The process the Senate followed for confirmations this year and next was outlined in a memo by Senate Ethics and Committee Chair Don Gaetz, himself a former Senate president, and committee vice chair Mack Bernard, a Democrat.
The memo explains that every gubernatorial appointee will be considered by their substantive committee as well as the Ethics and Elections Committee.

Members of the House are aiming to add North Carolina to the list of states in which consumers can limit this kind of online shadowing and prevent their personal information from being sold for targeted ads or data mining. 
House Bill 462 would allow consumers to confirm whether companies, called “controllers” in the bill, have their personal data. Consumers would be able to obtain their data, have it corrected, or have it deleted. Companies would have to tell consumers what third parties have their personal information. 
Consumers would be able to say they don’t want their personal data sold, and to opt out of targeted advertising. 
“For any company that is housing and keeping anyone’s data, they would have to be able to provide access to this data, even telling North Carolinians how their data is being used,” Rep. Terry Brown (D-Mecklenburg) told a House Judiciary committee. Brown is the lead sponsor of the bipartisan bill.
Nothing in the bill conflicts with federal law, he said.

Some social media companies would be required to have people younger than 18 obtain express consent from a parent or guardian before they can set up accounts. 
The bill excludes some companies from the age requirement, including “a social media company that allows a user to generate short video clips of dancing, voice overs, or other acts of entertainment in which the primary purpose is not educational or informative,” “a media company that exclusively offers interactive gaming, virtual gaming, or an online service,” and companies that provide information through subscriptions and whose primary purpose is not social interaction.
Since 2018, 19 states have passed data privacy laws, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals. North Carolina is one of a dozen states where legislators are actively considering such bills, according to the association. 
The bill won unanimous committee approval on Tuesday. 
The privacy measure is important now that consumer data is more readily available, Brown said after the committee meeting. 
“We’ve all seen the targeted advertisements. They’re getting more and more pervasive and invasive. So, I want to do what we can to mitigate some of that,” he said. 
Brown told the committee that he’d worked on the bill with the Bankers Association and the Healthcare Association and was in continuing talks with the Retail Merchants Association and individual companies. 
The industry input won’t weaken the bill, Brown said later. 
“My intent is to keep the teeth in this bill and to make sure that we’re protecting North Carolinians first and foremost,” he said.  “But with any bill that I put forward, I want to make sure that I’m talking to the folks that are going to be impacted by it. And where we can reach a compromise, I’m always happy to do so.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cybersecurity-laptop.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) on Tuesday chastised the United States Forest Service for refusing to publicly detail how staffing and other cuts could affect the federal response to wildfires expected soon in New Mexico and elsewhere. 
Stansbury directed her comments to Forest Service Associate Deputy Chief Ellen Shultzabarger, during the latter’s testimony to the U.S. House Federal Lands Subcommittee, on which Stansbury and fellow New Mexico Democrat Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández serve. Shultzaberger was there speaking in favor of a pair of bills that would allow specific, small pieces of federal forest land to be returned to states and cities, when questions from committee Democrats steered the conversation toward the upcoming wildfire season. 
“We are continuing to hire to have that goal of 11,300 operational firefighters, and we feel that we’ll be ready for the fire season,” Shultzabarger said. 
“With all due respect,” Stansbury responded, “I’ve been on the ground for the last couple of months, and Forest Service employees are terrified they’re going to lose their jobs, people are leaving in large numbers and thousands of people have been fired and not rehired. So while I appreciate that that is the company line here in this hearing, and I understand the position that you’re in, it’s just factually untrue. We are not prepared for this fire season.”
‘Stonewalling’: Forest Service mum on firings during wildfire briefing for congressional staff

Dozens of probationary Forest Service employees across New Mexico were fired or resigned since President Donald Trump took office. While judicial orders required the Trump administration to rehire those employees, many who tried to return were simply placed on paid administrative leave. 
While Forest Service officials have stressed that the mass firings were not aimed at employees whose sole job is dealing with wildfire, some outside estimates suggest three-quarters of those fired had “red cards,” meaning they could be called to help suppress a wildfire if one breaks out. A Colorado Democrat on the committee, Joe Neguse, estimated that 3,000 red card holders were fired. 
Meanwhile, Forest Service employees are awaiting the results of a “reduction-in-force” restructuring process that could take out another chunk of employees who are not on probationary status.

Asked about Stansbury’s comments after the meeting, Shultzabarger did not answer, instead deferring to Forest Service spokesperson Kyle Earnest, who did not provide further comment. 
Source New Mexico caught up with Stansbury after the hearing in Washington and asked her about the upcoming wildfire season, which forecasts predict could be dire and federal stonewalling on what used to be basic information. 
The following conversation took place during a short walk from the Capitol and has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source: Do you have any sense at all of what we could be looking at with reduction in force in New Mexico forests, in terms of employees lost?
MS: We have not received any specific plans. The New Mexico national forests have been heavily impacted by all the mass firings that have happened. The probationary firing that happened at the beginning of the DOGE effort resulted in dozens and dozens, both senior and junior, Forest Service employees, receiving notice that they’ve been fired. A lot of senior Forest Service officials did take the initial deferred departure offer, and we know that there is a RIF restructuring that is coming, but there’s been nothing released publicly, and there’s been nothing released internally. 
And so when I was home in New Mexico last week, during my town halls, I had Forest Service employees actually come to my town halls and speak to me privately about what’s happening. There’s a complete culture of fear. Nobody has any idea what’s going on. A lot of people are afraid they’re going to lose their jobs. …We’ve been heavily and disproportionately impacted. So we don’t have specific numbers, but we know that the entire workforce is in chaos and struggling right now.
Do you know the status of the interagency wildfire dispatch centers, including the one that’s in the Cibola National Forest office, which is on the DOGE termination list?
I don’t have any specific details. I mean, one of the things that I think has been really troubling about this entire DOGE exercise is that they claim that they’re doing it with transparency, and yet they refuse to come testify in front of Congress. They don’t even send political appointees to testify. Today, they sent a career staffer rather than a political appointee. And they transmit no information to congressional offices. And, you know, I say this all the time, but this is not normal. 
Heinrich gets ‘assurances’ that NM fire dispatch centers won’t close, but waiting on official word

In past administrations, regardless of what side of the aisle you are on, it has always been the norm and the practice that if you’re going to make a major change to a district, you notify the congressional offices, you notify the local officials, you notify towns and counties in the state, because all of them are impacted, and there’s zero communication at all between the administration DOG and local authorities, so we have no idea what they’re doing.
Do you think we’ll learn more in the president’s budget to be released this week about how those cuts will affect the New Mexico forests?
I don’t know. The word on the street is that the budget that will be transmitted this week is what they’re calling a skinny budget. So it will say, you know, [the] Forest Service’s budget is XYZ. It’s cut by XYZ amount and these programs, but I doubt it’ll have the level of detail that you see in a more fully fledged budget, where it describes in detail what their plans are. 
We ran into New Mexico State Forester Laura McCarthy near the Capitol, who told us she was here ‘lobbying’ but would not say for what bill or issue. Do you know?
She’s here? Wow, OK, I’m going to text her. I’m very good friends with Laura. My background is in water resources management, and she and I collaborated a lot on forest and water management in previous lives. So no, I don’t know what she’s up to here. But what I can say in general is that both states and tribes have been heavily impacted by the funding freezes. In fact, just yesterday, Mescalero Apache had a huge forest greenhouse project that had been on hold since the beginning of the Trump administration because they had frozen a [Bureau of Indian Affairs] grant they had received, and it was critical to growing seedlings for reforestation after these big fires, and they just found out yesterday that it had gotten unfrozen. 
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

So my guess is that the states and tribes and local authorities are trying to track down grants and federal funding. I think folks are very, very concerned about the upcoming fire season, as I mentioned in the hearing. We have the lowest snow pack in recorded history. And the thing to understand about that is it means that both the river is drying up already, which is unseasonably early, but it also means soil moisture and vegetation moisture is very low, which means basically the entire state’s a tinder box for the fire season. So if and when fires hit us, we’re at a very, very, extremely high risk for a really catastrophic fire season. And as you know, our communities are still reeling and recovering from the last major fires, and we can’t do it without support from the Forest Service, FEMA and these programs that they’re talking about cutting. It’s a bad situation.
The Cibola Forest has recently listed a couple of uranium mines near Mount Taylor as priority projects. Do you think those uranium mines could become operational?
Well, this administration is absolutely moving forward with stripping away protections for permitting and for national forests. They just issued guidance last week that would reduce all federal permitting to 28 days. In the case of, for example, Mount Taylor — which is not only set aside as national tourist land, but it’s also a sacred site for the pueblos and tribes of New Mexico — you can’t do an environmental and cultural review in 28 days. That’s just going to result in lawsuits. I believe that the administration is going to do everything it can to green-light mining and extractive activities on sensitive lands, and we will fight them every step of the way.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9579-1024x752.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Heritage Farm | Courtesy photo) A bill approved by Gov. Patrick Morrisey this week will allow the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources to issue permits to people to rehabilitate sick and injured wildlife. Morrisey signed House Bill 2836 on Monday. 
Rebecca Perry Franks, director of animal care and education at Heritage Farm and Museum in Huntington, helped champion the bill through the legislative session. 
A Huntington native, Franks said she fell in love with caring for sick and injured wildlife while interning at the Ohio Wildlife Center during college. She’s certified through the International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council but hasn’t been able to do that work since she returned to her home state. That made her start looking into how to change state law to make it legal for professionals here, she said.  
“It’s not something that everybody should be trying to do,” Franks said. “It takes training and careful consideration to make sure everybody is healthy, both people and animals throughout the process, but I truly believe that it has been hugely beneficial for the native wildlife of our surrounding states, and will be for ours as well.”
Under current West Virginia law, possession of wildlife outside of hunting season is illegal, said deputy DNR director Wendy Greene. The exceptions are avian centers, which are licensed by the federal government. 
Franks also runs a nonprofit wildlife hotline that takes questions from people who come across wild animals that are in danger or in need. Last year she fielded more than 270 calls between April and August, she said. 
“It continues to be very frustrating to have to tell everybody ‘hey, it’s currently illegal in this state to rehabilitate wildlife. All I can tell you to do is how to help keep it comfortable in its wild environment,’” Franks said. “Obviously that’s not the answer people like to hear. They want to be able to help. And a lot of people were taking matters into their own hands, against professional advice.” 
The bill authorizes the DNR to establish rules for the wildlife rehabilitation permit program.  While the bill is effective July 10, Greene said the DNR will have to establish rules and have them approved by the Legislature before it can accept applications. That won’t happen immediately, she said. 
“We won’t have anything definitive in place for several months,” Greene said. “…the law is passed, but it doesn’t mean folks can go out right now and grab up wildlife.”
The wildlife would be required to be returned to the wild unless it’s permanently impaired, the bill says. 
Heritage Farm currently has a nature center that educates visitors on native wildlife and domestic livestock. Once the application process is open, Franks hopes to be permitted to do wildlife rehabilitation and release as a part of her work there. 
“We’re an Appalachian history museum,” she said. “We celebrate natural history and cultural history, and why not help preserve our native wildlife as a part of that mission?”
The bill was sponsored by Del. Matthew Rohrbach, R-Cabell, who said the bill is a good way to help wildlife and, in the case of Heritage Farm, educate children who visit the Huntington attraction. 
“I think we all hope that it will help injured wildlife and also increase awareness of veterinary sciences,” Rohrbach said. “I could see a young child, perhaps visiting Heritage Farm, for instance, although it could be just as easily the [Oglebay] Good Zoo in Wheeling or other places, but seeing some of this being carried out, and then a young girl or young boy might get interested in veterinary science, go to veterinary school because of their exposure to something like this.”
The DNR intends to make the requirements the same as those of the International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council, Greene said. 
According to the bill, permits are prohibited for people who have been convicted of charges related to wildlife, animal cruelty or animal welfare. 
A fiscal note says the new program will cost the DNR about $92,000 per year. The division plans to assign a wildlife biologist and a secretary to work the program during half their time. The money for the program will be reallocated from other parts of the agency, the fiscal note says. Greene said the number is purely an estimate. 
“We have no idea how many people want to apply, how many people will be qualified,” she said. “We anticipate part of the application process being our biologist will go out to inspect facilities. So we were just guessing at how many we would have to process and inspect. It could be lower, it could be higher.”
Greene said the new law puts West Virginia in line with other Appalachian states that allow wildlife rehabilitation. 
“We were the only state in Appalachia that didn’t have a rehabilitation program for wildlife,” Greene said. “I think that, as an agency, we will be focused on rule development. We’ll be focused on making sure we’re still able to effectively control disease management. That would be one of our bigger concerns.”
Specifically, the DNR is concerned about chronic wasting disease, a fatal contagious disease in deer. She said the statute will allow the agency the authority needed to control the disease.
“I don’t know what that’s going to look like exactly,” she said. “My biologists — and I’m not a biologist, so I’m not going to speak for them — but they are currently working and looking at what we would need to do, whether that’s to control movement of different wildlife from different locations, or education. We’ll just have to see where we go with that.”

House File 299 was passed by the Senate 32-16. The bill requires all Iowa K-12 schools, as well as child care centers, community colleges, universities under the Iowa Board of Regents as well as private universities using the tuition grant program, to include information on exemptions when communicating with students and families about vaccine requirements. For child care facilities and K-12 schools, information on vaccine requirement exemptions must also be published on their website and be included in student registration documents.
Republicans who spoke in support of the measure said it was needed because there were some reports of school staff falsely claiming that vaccines were required — with no exceptions — for students to be able to attend school.
Sen. Dennis Guth, R-Klemme, shared a story from a mother who spoke on the bill during a subcommittee meeting. He said the woman claimed that while she was registering her child for an exemption to vaccine requirements, she witnessed another parent being told they needed to get vaccinations despite expressing they did not want to vaccine their child.

“The first mother came and said, ‘There are exemptions, you know, you don’t have to do that,’ and the school official said, ‘I’m sorry, no shots, no school,'” Guth said. “That’s just not the truth. We have a law in Iowa, and this will help make sure that that law is upheld.”
Iowa law requires students to receive vaccinations to enroll in schools, including receiving the polio, measles, hepatitis B, varicella and meningococcal vaccines while in the K-12 school system. However, families have the ability to opt out from these requirements if vaccinating their child “conflicts with a genuine and sincere religious belief.” The law does not require families to obtain a waiver or specify their religion to claim the exemption.
Medical exemptions can also be granted by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner who finds a required vaccination would be harmful to the health and well-being of the child or a member of their family.
While exemptions exist, Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Cedar Rapids, said the bill “risks sending a mixed message about the importance of the safety of vaccines” by emphasizing vaccine exemptions, potentially putting students in danger by diminishing herd immunity.
“The implications of this legislation could undermine public health efforts and lead to increased vaccine hesitancy, weakening our state and threatening our children,” Donahue said. “To be clear, vaccinations are safe. And this bill is particularly troubling when a resurgence of preventable diseases in areas with low vaccine rates is happening. Right now, we see measles popping up in multiple states.”
As of April 24, there have been a total of 884 confirmed measles cases in 29 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The largest outbreak has been in Texas, where two unvaccinated children died from the disease. Though no cases have been reported in Iowa since 2019, according to state public health officials, the neighboring states of Illinois and Minnesota have reported confirmed measles cases in 2025.
Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner also emphasized the efficacy of the measles vaccine in the wake of the recent outbreak and deaths from the disease.
“I’m left wondering how many have looked at the numbers of graves of young children in cemeteries prior to the advent of these vaccines, or looked into the long-term effects of measles on the immune system,” Weiner said. “… It is preventable, completely preventable through vaccination, and that is the most effective way to protect individuals and communities from measles.”
Having a wide majority of a people vaccinated — 95% — is needed to provide overall community protection from measles, according to medical professionals, especially for those who cannot get vaccinated because of issues like age or other health problems. Weiner said the bill will allow families to “feel free and are actually encouraged to opt out of life-saving vaccines,” which will put others at risk.
“This is unnecessary and in my view, irresponsible,” Weiner said. “We have a duty to Iowans. We should be informing the public about the safety, efficacy and importance of the measles and other vaccinations, and working to keep kids healthy and Iowans healthy.”
But Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, said the measure is not taking a stance on vaccines. He called the bill “an honesty bill,” because it is requiring schools share accurate information on vaccination requirements — and the fact that parents can seek exemptions.
“What’s troubling to me is a handful of schools in the state that decide it’s okay to lie to parents, that if you don’t receive shots then you can’t send your kids to school,” Green said. “That is a lie, and our parents in the state of Iowa deserve better. And so that’s what this bill ensures. It ensures an honest conversation between the taxpayers, the parents and the schools.”
The bill, which the Iowa House passed in March, goes to Gov. Kim Reynolds for final approval.

(Photo courtesy of Madison Public Library)The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) received $1.6 million in grants from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to support library operations and programming last week, though uncertainty remains for the program. 
Wisconsin libraries rely on funding provided by the federal government through the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) Grants to States Program, but that program has been in danger since President Donald Trump signed an executive order to downsize and begin the process of eliminating the agency. DPI and libraries throughout the state have warned that eliminating the funding would be a blow to statewide support for library programs as the grants fund staff for programs including the interlibrary loan system and other grants.
The notification message from IMLS to DPI stated that the partial payment is for the time period through April 2025. It also notified the state agency that “any additional amounts are subject to the availability of funds, IMLS discretion and other actions” and that “should those conditions be met, IMLS anticipates issuing supplemental awards and will send the allotment table at that time.”
“At this time, the DPI has not received a final allotment table indicating the amount of funding Wisconsin will receive,” the DPI stated in an update to libraries Tuesday afternoon. “This is not the typical fashion in which these funds are granted to states, but receiving a partial award provides some stability and relief in the short term.” 
The uncertainties for federal funding will still have some impact on the services that DPI carries out. Typically, the DPI Library Services office opens grant subawards, which are grants funded by federal funds and administered by the state agency, to library systems in Wisconsin in July. That won’t happen this year due to the uncertainty surrounding the amount and timing of future Grants to States funds.
“The DPI will prioritize the Library Services salaries and the tools necessary to do their jobs with this partial allotment,” DPI said in the email. The Library Services team is made up of about 20 people with 16 of the positions funded with federal dollars. “The team will reassess the viability of providing subawards once more is known about the future of IMLS and LSTA funding.” 
The amount that the state received is about half of the $3.23 million that Wisconsin received for the Grants to States Program received in 2024. 
Ben Miller, DPI library services director, had previously told the Examiner that the expected payment would serve as the next milestone for the state agency. There was uncertainty surrounding whether the payment would be sent given the gutting of staff for the IMLS office and the fact that other grants for libraries and museums have already been cut. Wisconsin is part of a multi-state lawsuit challenging the cuts to IMLS.
Miller had said that even if the agency received the payment, it will likely be cautious in proceeding with certain actions as the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018, the federal law that the grant program relies on, is up for renewal this fall. 
DPI spokesperson Chris Bucher said in an email to the Examiner that the state agency is “encouraged” by the first payment and is “optimistic given the IMLS note about issuing the supplemental awards.” 
“Our top priority remains being [of] service to Wisconsin kids and communities,” Bucher said. 
DPI also it would continue to provide updates to libraries as the situation evolves and thanked the library community for “sharing your stories, working with elected officials, and remaining steadfast in the incredible services you provide every day.” Libraries across the state have been working to inform the public about the potential cuts and to advocate for the federal funding with lawmakers. 
“Keep being loud and proud about the meaningful work happening in your libraries and communities,” DPI wrote.

Photo by Patrick McCaffrey via Wikimedia CommonsA federal judge has signed off on the sale of Burke Mountain Resort for $11.5 million, releasing the Northeast Kingdom ski mountain from nearly a decade of federal receivership. Judge Darrin P. Gayles issued an order Thursday in U.S. District Court in Miami formally approving the sale of Burke Mountain to Bear Den Partners LLC, a consortium of entities with longstanding ties to the ski resort. “A private sale to the Buyer is the only current viable alternative for preserving and capturing the value of the Assets for the benefit of the receivership estate,” Gayles wrote in the court order.The ski area’s buyer is a group that includes Burke Mountain Academy, a world-class ski racing school located in Burke, and the Graham family, who briefly owned the resort in the early 2000s. The group has pledged to put around $30 million into the resort to fund significant upgrades to its lift infrastructure and the hotel at the base of the mountain. Melissa Gullotti, a spokesperson for Bear Den Partners, said that pending a few administrative details being resolved, the group expects to formally close the deal in early May. The decision comes just days after Michael Goldberg, the lawyer overseeing the resort’s receivership, asked Gayles to approve the deal, writing at the time that the agreement was “in the best interest of the investors, the employees and the Burke ski community.”Gayles appointed Goldberg receiver of Burke Mountain Resort and Jay Peak, another Northeast Kingdom ski area, in 2016, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought a civil suit against Ariel Quiros, the former owner of both properties, and Bill Stenger, former CEO of Jay Peak. The two men were accused of defrauding investors participating in the federal EB-5 visa program in what has since become the largest fraud case in Vermont history. READ MORE

In 2022, Goldberg sold Jay Peak to Pacific Group Resorts Inc., a Utah-based management company, for $76 million. About $60 million of that went to defrauded investors, though it only covered an average of 22% of their losses. In court filings, Goldberg has suggested that much of the proceeds from the sale of Burke Mountain Resort would similarly go toward making the investors whole, although it’s unclear how much they would receive. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal judge approves $11.5 million sale of Burke Mountain Resort.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Burke-Mountain-Ski-Resort-Vermont.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

On April 28, 2022, the Ole Miss baseball Rebels had won 23 games and lost 17 overall. They were 6-12 in the Southeastern Conference. The various Internet message boards were filled with posts calling for head baseball coach Mike Bianco’s dismissal. Yes, and two months later, Bianco and his Rebels won the College World Series.

Contrast that with this: On April 28 of this year, Mississippi State’s Diamond Dogs had a 25-19 record overall, 7-14 in the SEC. The various Internets boards were filled with posts calling for head coach Chris Lemonis to be fired. He was.
In both those situations, the Mississippi teams were six games over the .500 mark overall. In both those situations, the teams had lost twice as many SEC games as they had won. Ole Miss stayed the course, and it paid off, remarkably so. In sharp contrast, Mississippi State pulled the trigger, and we shall see what happens next.
Another big difference in the two situations: Bianco had never won a national championship in his previous 20 years at Ole Miss. Lemonis won the first national championship in State history just four years ago.
You ask me, that national championship, not even four years ago, should have earned Lemonis, at the very least, the right to finish out this season. I don’t see anything to be gained with firing the man with three weeks remaining in the regular season. Most NCAA Tournament projections have Mississippi State listed as one of the first four teams out. The Bulldogs are ranked 45th in RPI against the nation’s 13th most difficult schedule. They are on the NCAA Tournament bubble, just as Ole Miss was three seasons ago.
This is not to say I believe that Lemonis, given the opportunity, would have done what Bianco did three years ago, But it is certainly within the realm of possibility. We’ve seen it happen. In baseball, more than any other sport, teams run hot and cold. State could have gotten hot, gotten on a roll in May and June and at least made it to the College World Series. It happens for someone nearly every year in college baseball. For that matter, it could still happen for State this year with interim head coach Justin Parker calling the shots.
And I know what many of those calling for the dismissal of Lemonis will say. They’ll say that in firing Lemonis now, State can get a head start on hiring a new coach to turn the program around. Not so. Any coach that the Bulldogs would hire is still coaching a team and will be coaching a team through at least May. 
Traditionally, Mississippi State baseball is one of the nation’s top programs. State baseball facilities are second to none. Fan support is among the nation’s best. 
But it is not, as athletic director Zac Selmon put it “the premier program in college baseball.” It is much more accurate to say State’s is a really good program in the premier conference in college baseball.
LSU, Texas, and Arkansas, all teams in the same conference, have similar fan support, terrific facilities and have enjoyed much more on-the-field success. Tennessee has improved dramatically. Ole Miss, Alabama, Auburn, Georgia, Texas A & M have made huge strides in facilities, fan support and baseball emphasis. 
And here’s the deal: Tradition, facilities and fan support, while still important, all have become secondary issues when it comes to ingredients for success in college athletics. You know what really matters most? NIL and the ability to attract players in the transfer portal, that’s what. This is no longer amateur sports. It’s pay-for-play. It’s professional sports in every respect.
The first question recruits ask: What can you pay me? The first question any prospective coach will ask Mississippi State: How much money will I get to pay players? In Monday’s press release announcing the dismissal of Lemonis, Selmon was quoted as saying State’s baseball “NIL offerings” are second to none. There’s no way of knowing for sure, but I have heard otherwise from numerous sources.
 I hate that we have reached this point in college athletics, but we most assuredly have. I also hate that Lemonis, a good man and a good coach, doesn’t get the chance to finish the season. I thought he had earned that.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/07084848/AP_443445095797.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Courtesy of Idaho National Laboratory)Officials with the state of Idaho and the U.S. Department of Energy have agreed to a waiver of the state’s 1995 nuclear waste settlement agreement, the two sides announced Tuesday.
The new waiver will allow for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho for the purposes of conducting research at Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho, officials said.
The waiver specifically allows for a high burnout nuclear fuel cask from the North Anna Power Station, a commercial nuclear power plant located in Virginia, to be sent to Idaho National Laboratory for research, according to a press release issued Tuesday.

The waiver was necessary because the 1995 settlement agreement called for limiting shipments of, and removing certain types of, spent nuclear fuel in Idaho.
“The collaborative effort between the state of Idaho, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Idaho National Laboratory showcases our commitment to advancing nuclear energy research while upholding the goals of the 1995 Settlement Agreement,” Little said in a written statement.
“We are proud to support innovation in nuclear energy that will support national security and energy independence into the future.”
Research at INL to support licensing for extended storage of spent fuel at nuclear power plants
Idaho National Laboratory, or INL, is one of 17 Department of Energy national labs, and it employs or contacts with about 6,400 researchers and support staff.
Much of the nuclear research and energy research conducted by Idaho National Laboratory occurs at a vast research complex referred to as “the site” that is located in the eastern Idaho desert, between the town of Arco and Idaho Falls.
“Idaho National Laboratory is DOE’s lead lab for nuclear energy research and development, and it is critical that we continue to grow this research capacity and maintain American competitiveness,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a written statement. “This agreement between the State of Idaho and DOE ensures the lab can continue its cutting-edge research to advance nuclear technology, helping to meet President Trump’s commitment to unleash American energy dominance.”
In today’s press release, state and federal officials said the research will provide data to support licensing for the extended storage of spent fuel at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states.
“As the nation’s center for nuclear energy research and development, we look forward to utilizing our unique facilities and expertise to support this critical national need,” Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner said in a written statement. “We are thankful to the Department of Energy and the state of Idaho for entrusting us with the safe and secure execution of our vital mission.”
1995 settlement agreement came after environmental, health concerns from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho
As part of the new waiver, Idaho National Laboratory will also be allowed to safely manage small amounts of spent nuclear fuel from domestic university reactors. Without the waiver, some U.S. universities could have been forced to shut down their research reactors due to limits on spent fuel storage, officials said.
Signed in October 1995 by then-Gov. Phil Batt, the 1995 settlement agreement resolved a lawsuit filed by the state amid public concern about environmental and health resulting from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho. The lawsuit was filed in order to keep Idaho from becoming a dumping ground for the country’s spent nuclear fuel, according to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality.
The new waiver relaxes the annual limit on the amount of spent nuclear fuel and materials that can come into Idaho, officials said. The shipment could occur in 2027 under the waiver.

How’s that for regressive? 
Employment Security Department numbers show that middle- and upper-income people use paid leave far more than those with lower incomes. In fact, people making $60 or more an hour used the fund nearly twice as much as the lowest wage earners in fiscal year 2024. Meanwhile, full-time workers of all incomes already lose hundreds of dollars a year to this tax. (Calculate your losses here: https://paidleave.wa.gov/estimate-your-paid-leave-payments/.)  
The Paid Family and Medical Leave program is no safety net. It makes most workers less able to pay for the life needs they do have. The Legislature should have considered ending it this year.
Instead, lawmakers considered Senate Bill 5292, which in the end proposed taxing workers up to $2 of every $100 in earnings in the coming years for a benefit many will never see. That new, higher rate would’ve been more than double the current tax. The bill died, but the proposal could still be considered again next session. That’s likely because the funding now available for the program doesn’t cover its costs.
The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee said that administrative costs and benefits exceeded revenue for the paid-leave program in two of its first four years. And in 2023, the program got a $200 million bailout from the state’s general fund to deal with higher-than-expected claims. The fix was temporary, however. A state consultant forecasts that the program will likely see negative net income again in three of the next five years. 
That’s not hard to understand. People like it when other taxpayers help pay for their life wants and needs — especially when a portion of their wages has contributed to a pool of money during their working years.
Already burdensome
This year, the tax for the program is already 92 cents on every $100 a worker earns — up to the 2025 Social Security cap of $176,100. That’s more than twice the amount when the tax began in 2019 at 40 cents per $100 of earnings. (Employees pay about 72% of this tax. Employers contribute about 28% on behalf of their employees. That’s money that then can’t go toward increased worker pay or other benefits.)
The most recent version of Senate Bill 5292 outlined increases in the 1.2% Paid Family and Medical Leave tax rate cap. The bill called for raising it to 1.4% in 2027 and 2028, 1.6% in 2029 and 2030, 1.8% in 2031 and 2032, and 2% for 2033 and subsequent years.
While some supporters of this harmful worker tax brag that thousands have been helped by it, they fail to mention that millions of workers have not. And for some of those workers, making ends meet is more difficult because of it. The paid-leave tax penalty state lawmakers have placed on workers puts self-sufficiency further out of reach for some Washingtonians and should end. 
Federal law already allows workers 12 weeks of job-protected, unpaid family leave. It doesn’t pay people not to work while taxing those who do work but don’t have the luxury of taking weeks off, even with paid leave.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/taxes-coins-blocks-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 16:09:17.570475

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Analysis of potential congressional cuts to Medicaid indicated Kansas’ loss of nearly $350 million in the first year and more than $3 billion over 10 years could shrink coverage for vulnerable populations, escalate family medical debt and raise the risk of hospital closures.
Reductions in federal financing of Medicaid could lead to downsizing by 5% to 15% the number of Medicaid enrollees in Kansas and trigger a decline of 22% in Medicaid funding to hospitals in the state. Kansas has two-dozen rural hospitals at risk of immediate closure. Shrinking federal funding to Medicaid could add to the burden of uncompensated patient care and threaten hospitals operating on narrow margins.
The findings were in a report released Tuesday by REACH Healthcare Foundation and United Methodist Health Ministry Fund, both health-related philanthropies serving Kansans. The report incorporated analysis from Manatt Health, which provides strategic, policy and legal advisory services in the health care industry.
Impetus for the projections was upcoming debate in Congress on a goal of cutting $880 billion in federal spending on Medicaid in the next decade.
“The data is clear and deeply concerning,” said David Jordan, president and CEO of United Methodist Health Ministry Fund. “We will all pay the price – higher costs, increases in local taxes and less access to care – to offset these cuts. It’s critical that lawmakers, health care providers, advocates and the people of Kansas recognize the consequences before it’s too late.”
United Methodist Health Ministry Fund is a statewide foundation that has worked since 1986 to improve the health of Kansans.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program offering health coverage to lower-income Kansas children, seniors, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Medicaid enrolls 366,000 Kansans, including 31% of the state’s children. Medicaid supports four of seven nursing home residents in Kansas as well as one in four working-age adults in the state who have a disability, the report said.
There is interest among congressional Republicans in adopting a national work requirement for recipients of Medicaid. The Kansas Medicaid program, known as KanCare, doesn’t extend coverage to working-age adults regardless of income unless the recipient was a parent, caregiver or a person with a disability.
“Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds in Kansas and any cuts to the program will have severe economic and health impacts felt in every corner of the state,” said Brenda Sharpe, president and CEO of REACH Healthcare Foundation.
REACH is a charitable organization striving to improve access to quality, affordable care for uninsured and medically underserved residents of Johnson, Wyandotte and Allen counties in Kansas and Jackson, Cass and Lafayette counties in Missouri.
Manatt Health relied on computer modeling to produce one-year and 10-year projections for Medicaid based on the idea of reducing federal expenditures by $880 billion within a decade. The work by Manatt Health was released before Congress completed work on spending adjustments, but the assessment aligned with policy parameters, options and effective dates outlined by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Medicaid-cut-report-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-29 16:09:17.570475

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A coalition of Colorado’s Republican members of Congress, Republican state lawmakers, county sheriffs and the Colorado State Shooting Association want U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the constitutionality of nearly 20 state gun laws they say infringe on Second Amendment rights.
In a letter sent Monday, the group asked Bondi to take up the review using the Second Amendment Enforcement Task Force her office established in early April.
“Over the past few years, the State of Colorado and some of its larger cities and political subdivisions have, through a progression of increasingly oppressive and burdensome statutes and ordinances, engaged in a systemic and unrelenting campaign designed to restrict, impair, impede and ultimately extinguish Coloradans’ right to bear arms in violation of our Constitution,” the letter reads.
House Republicans sent a similar request to Bondi’s office a few weeks ago, but now more people are on board, including the state Senate Republican caucus, Colorado’s four Republican members of Congress, and 14 county sheriffs. The Colorado State Shooting Association is the state branch of the National Rifle Association.

They urged Bondi to investigate Colorado’s “anti-Second Amendment agenda” and identify “federal remedies” including litigation. They also want an assessment of how the laws impact “law-abiding citizens” and rural residents, hunters, people in poverty and people who rely on guns for self defense.
The letter mentions laws including the state’s high capacity ammunition law, “red flag” law, waiting period requirement, minimum age requirement and expanded training for concealed carry permits. The majority of the laws called out in the letter were passed in the last three years.
It also highlights Senate Bill 25-3, signed into law earlier this month, that sets training requirements to purchase most semiautomatic firearms with detachable magazines. The law is set to go into effect in August 2026. It passed the Legislature with entirely Democratic support.
The letter says that the new law fails to meet the “constitutional benchmarks” set by a series of gun-related U.S. Supreme Court cases. Throughout the lawmaking process, however, bill sponsors asserted that they believe it would stand up to a legal challenge. Colorado joins states including California, Washington and Oregon that require training to buy certain guns.
“I think this bill will make Colorado’s communities safer and prevent accidents as well as reduce gun violence, ultimately saving lives while protecting our Second Amendment rights,” Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said as he signed SB-3.
In a statement, Attorney General Phil Weiser said SB-3 was “commonsense.”
“Colorado communities — from Aurora and Colorado Springs to Boulder and Littleton — have been devastated by gun violence. While each mass killing brings unique pain and trauma, they all have one thing in common: weapons that are more suited for war than for self-defense or hunting,” he said in an email. “I will continue to go to court to defend Colorado and our laws whenever they are attacked by the gun lobby or Washington, DC.”
It is likely SB-3 will face litigation from gun-rights groups.
The federal task force is composed of Bondi, the yet-to-be-confirmed associate attorney general, and representatives from the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division and Civil Rights Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It has not yet met.

School district officials, educators did not keep information from high schooler’s parents or violate mother’s religious rights, federal judge concludes.
The post Judge: Rock Springs school didn’t violate parental rights in transgender pronoun case appeared first on WyoFile .","Sweetwater County educators did not keep information from the parents of a Rock Springs high school student who asked to be called by a preferred name and pronouns, a federal judge ruled Monday.
U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl reached that conclusion en route to dismissing a lawsuit brought by the child’s parents, who had alleged the district violated their rights by deliberately concealing information about their child’s name and pronoun choices. The student’s mother, a public school teacher in Sweetwater County, further alleged that her First Amendment religious rights were violated by district policies that direct staff about how to handle students’ preferred names and pronouns.
Skavdahl rebuffed both allegations, agreeing with Sweetwater County School District 1 lawyers that the case should be decided in the educators’ favor before it reached a jury.
“The undisputed facts establish that Defendants did not withhold or knowingly misrepresent any information regarding the Student from or to Plaintiff, and thus did not interfere with this right,” Skavdahl wrote. “Neither did Defendants’ conduct burden Plaintiff’s First Amendment right to freely exercise her religious beliefs as a parent or unconstitutionally interfere with her right to freely exercise her religious beliefs as a teacher.”
The student’s parents, Ashley and Sean Willey, sued Sweetwater County School District 1 leaders and educators in April 2023. They asked the court to bar the district from using any names or pronouns other than the ones their teenager was given at birth without prior written consent. 
Ashley Willey also asked the court to block the district from forcing her, as a teacher, to use her students’ preferred pronouns or names. Willey did not use students’ preferred pronouns and names as a teacher, and she testified she was never disciplined or retaliated against for her decision, according to Skavdahl’s ruling.
The Willey family filed the lawsuit amid rising concerns, often expressed by conservative-leaning parents, that schools were influencing student decisions about gender identity. That spurred efforts to ban or limit access to certain LGBTQ+ books at school and public libraries in Wyoming. State lawmakers also brought measures designed to prevent school districts and public employees from being required to use preferred pronouns and names, while requiring schools to provide parents with more information about their children. A school district pronoun bill died in the state Senate while the state-employee focused legislation became law without Gov. Mark Gordon’s signature.

Earlier this year, Wyoming’s schools superintendent, Megan Degenfelder, also pushed for a requirement that schools receive parental consent before using a child’s preferred name or pronouns.
Parental rights, district obligations
In the Willeys’ lawsuit, the parents alleged their child asked teachers and staff at Black Butte High School in Rock Springs to be called by a male name and pronouns starting in the 2021-22 school year. They accused the district of keeping that development from them by continuing to use the child’s gender assigned at birth in their presence, while using the teen’s preferred name and pronouns in school. 
During depositions, three school staff members testified they used the student’s preferred name and pronouns during the 2021-22 school year. Another teacher did so in an email exchange during the 2022-23 school year.
The Willeys asserted that the district should have proactively informed them about their child’s change in name and pronouns because parents have a right to make decisions about their children’s well-being, including their physical and mental health. 
But Skavdahl noted that such a stance would be impractical, as there are a “laundry list of circumstances that could affect a child’s ‘well-being’ even in the slightest that would require constant, detailed information sharing from the school, with constitutional consequences.”
The judge agreed that parents have a right to know about their child’s gender identity choices if parents seek that information from schools. But he drew a distinction between a district knowingly keeping that information from a parent and a district that provides such information only when asked.
“The Court does not think the information can properly be deemed ‘withheld’ to infringe on parental rights unless a parent inquired into or sought the information and it was intentionally concealed or they were lied to,” Skavdahl wrote. “Otherwise, an infinite amount of information would be deemed ‘withheld’ by schools on a daily basis in violation of parental rights.”
“The District and its staff members merely respected the Student’s voluntary choice to be referred to by preferred name and pronouns,” the judge wrote later in the opinion. “Neither the District nor its staff members required the Student go by preferred name or pronouns nor did they ‘discourage students from discussing their gender identities with their parents.’”
Moreover, the school district shared information with the parents about their child’s preferred name and pronouns when that information was sought, the judge noted.
Skavdahl also rejected the Willeys’ arguments that educators facilitated the student’s gender transition socially, and thus, invalidated the parents’ right to make medical decisions for their teen.
“Plaintiff offers no evidence that the school provided any type of ‘medical transition’ or even ‘facilitated’ the Student’s ‘social transitioning,’” Skavdahl wrote. “Defendants were not involved in changing the Student’s clothing or hairstyle. Plaintiff did not set forth any facts that staff members even encouraged or suggested the Student engage in such behaviors, but simply that staff members passively respected the Student’s request to be referred to by preferred name and pronouns.”
Freedom of religion
Skavdahl also denied Ashley Willey’s claims that the district violated her freedom of religion, both as a parent and as a teacher. She had argued the district’s failure to inform her about her child’s gender identity changes interfered with her religious beliefs because it kept her from information she needed to counsel her child.
But that reasoning would create an obligation on the part of the district to foster the exercise of Willey’s religious beliefs, the judge wrote.
To conclude that the District’s failure to act in accordance with Plaintiff’s religious beliefs is a constitutional violation would turn the First Amendment on its head.”Judge scott skavdahl
“Plaintiff’s allegations, more plainly, are that the District staff members’ use, at the Student’s request, of preferred name and pronouns were counter to Plaintiff’s own religious beliefs,” he wrote. “However, a person’s constitutional right to freely exercise their own religious beliefs does not require that the state also exercise those same religious beliefs … To conclude that the District’s failure to act in accordance with Plaintiff’s religious beliefs is a constitutional violation would turn the First Amendment on its head.”
As to Wiley’s assertions that being required to follow the district’s policies concerning preferred pronouns and names violated her religious rights, Skavdahl was unswayed. Those policies were “neutral laws of general applicability,” they don’t raise concerns about the free exercise of religion and must only be “rationally related to a legitimate government interest” to be considered constitutional. That interest, Skavdahl wrote, involved promoting an educational environment that’s both respectful and without discrimination.

“We know that we have an infant and maternal mortality crisis in our state,” said Lisa Waddell, chair of the taskforce that wrote the report. “Moms are dying unnecessarily. Infants continue to die and don’t survive until their first year of life. And there are things that we can do.”
Maternal mortality
In 2021, 47 of every 100,000 live births in the state resulted in the mother’s deaths before, during or after delivery, according to a state committee’s analysis. The data consistently lags about three years.
For Black women, that ratio was nearly 72 for every 100,000 births. For white women, it was about 37.
That’s an increase from 2020, when the statewide maternal mortality rate was 32 for every 100,000 births. While maternal mortality rates for Black mothers steadily increased for at least four years, the rate for white mothers dropped from 2018 to 2020 before spiking again in 2021, according to committee data.
The exact reasons why are not clear because so many factors play into maternal mortality, said Maya Pack, executive director of the Institute of Medicine and Public Health. But it seems like spikes in COVID-19, which complicated risk factors already associated with pregnancy, contributed to the increase, Waddell said.
Between 2018 and 2021, the No. 1 cause of maternal deaths was infection, specifically from COVID-19, according to the report. Despite emerging in 2020, COVID-19 accounted for nearly 14% of deaths for pregnant women and new mothers during those four years, the report found.
With the virus being less of a concern, the hope is that the ratio of maternal deaths caused by COVID-19 infections has decreased in recent years, Waddell said.
Even in that case, though, the maternal mortality rate remains much higher than it should be, Pack said. For years, the state has consistently scored among the worst in the country for maternal and infant health.
“The persistence of this problem is really troubling,” Pack said.
Part of the problem is that pregnancy often exacerbates a woman’s existing health issues. For instance, if a woman has diabetes before becoming pregnant, as about one-third of people in the state do, that can cause life-threatening issues during pregnancy, according to the report.
“If we could promote healthier lifestyles and healthier communities throughout our state at all times, the women who are going to become pregnant are going to be more likely to be healthy and therefore have a healthier pregnancy and have a healthier baby,” Pack said.
Women in rural areas, where health care is less accessible, are especially at risk, the report found.
Some women must travel upwards of an hour to reach the closest birthing hospital or obstetrician and gynecologist. Since 2012, 13 labor and delivery units have closed in the state, and about one quarter of hospitals don’t offer obstetric care, according to the report.
“The farther a woman travels to their birthing hospital, the greater the risk of maternal morbidity outcomes,” the report states.
Women in rural areas are also less likely to have health insurance and to be able to afford prenatal and postpartum care. That translates to less revenue for the medical services that do exist in rural areas, causing fewer to locate there and worsening the problem, according to the report.
Health issues for rural women often come at a high cost to the state. Rural women are more likely to use Medicaid to pay for health care services, with the state-funded health insurance covering 71% of rural deliveries compared to 60% statewide, according to the report.
Increased Medicaid costs for maternal health, especially for emergency services on which women in rural areas often rely, amounted to about $357 million in 2019, according to the report.
“This is a great state to live in, but we need to ensure that our mothers are safe, that our infants are surviving,” Waddell said. “Anything less than that is not OK.”
Solutions
Some solutions are already in place to help pregnant women and new mothers access health care.
In January, the state Medicaid agency received a $17 million grant, to be handed out over the coming decade, “to invest in improving maternal health care for South Carolinians enrolled in the Health Connections Medicaid program,” according to the report.
The Department of Public Health is expected to launch mobile maternal health clinics over the summer in an effort to help reach women in rural areas without other nearby care.
Expanding programs already in place could address part of the problem, Pack said. Some programs have seen good results but operate only in specific cities or counties, she said.
Those organizations could also use more resources to increase awareness of services for mothers who may not know they have other options, she said.
“Understanding the resources available to one’s family at the community level is a big part of that health literacy,” Pack said.
Even as health professionals faced rising maternal mortality rates, the prevalence of programs trying to address the problems give researchers hope, they said Tuesday. That shows people are aware of the problem and trying to help, Waddell said.
Still, there’s more to be done. The report makes a dozen recommendations to help increase access to care, bolster the health care workforce and teach both doctors and patients more about maternal care, including other risk factors, such as mental health and substance use issues.
For instance, a grant program similar to the one the state’s Medicaid agency used to encourage hospitals to open more behavioral health care units could similarly increase maternal care in areas that need it, according to the report.
Group prenatal classes could encourage women to keep up with their appointments and be more engaged with their care. Opening maternal-specific care units in existing public health departments could create more access, even if it’s somewhat limited, the report suggests.
Dedicated transportation systems could help rural women reach health care providers, while more telehealth could allow women in rural areas to chat with their doctors without having to find a way to get to the office, the report suggests.
“All of these various programs that are being recommended will make a difference,” Waddell said. “I’m convinced that they will. We’ve got a lot of energy, optimism and excitement around really wanting to do things that are better for women and infants in our state, and I’m convinced that this report will help.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2176-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 16:09:17.570475

(Screenshot/Capitol TV)Emily Mandel, a senior economist for Moody’s Analytics, opened her presentation to Rhode Island state budget crunchers Tuesday with a caveat:
“You will probably be very tired of hearing the word ‘tariff’ by the end of this.” 
Mandel’s comments came during the Rhode Island’s biannual Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference at the Rhode Island State House.
The twice-a-year conference updating state revenue and spending forecasts aims to help lawmakers shape the state’s fiscal 2026 budget, which will take effect July 1. But Rhode Island’s financial future looks fuzzier than ever as question marks hang over federal funding to state governments and the fallout from the international trade war.
“Recession risks remain very high, and it’s evolving day by day,” Mandel said. “It will feel somewhat recession-adjacent.”
The average tariff rate of 21%, based on the existing 145% reciprocal tariffs with China and 10% tariff on goods from all other countries, is the highest the United States has seen since 1909.
“It’s not unprecedented, but it’s unprecedented over the last century,” Mandel said.
The country, and by extension Rhode Island, will see job growth and wages stagnate as consumer and business costs surge as tariff consequences take hold this summer. Assuming Trump backs off the tariff policies — still a major if — economic recovery is expected by 2027, according to Moody’s latest forecast.
Meanwhile, cuts to federal funding, including for Medicaid, threaten to devastate Rhode Island, which relies on an outsized share of federal funding in its spending relative to other states, according to analysis from Pew Charitable Trusts.

And, preserving the state’s declining population will become even more challenging as residents flee for less destinations in the South and mid-Atlantic, as well as cheaper New England states like Maine and New Hampshire. 
Moody’s analysts did not name specific income tax policies, such as a millionaire’s tax, as an influence on out-of-state migration. However, they noted that neighboring Massachusetts, which began an extra 4% tax on income over $1 million in 2023, has lost some residents to Rhode Island in recent years.
Legislation introduced in both chambers of the Rhode Island State House calls for a 3% surtax on the top 1% of state earners, setting off the perennial debate over what could be a new state revenue source, or a deterrent to wealthy residents.
Will rich Rhode Islanders flee because of a millionaires tax? Don’t believe it, advocates say.

A new report published Monday by The Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive D.C. think tank, showed the amount of top earners who live in Massachusetts, as well as their collective wealth, has increased since voters passed the “Fair Share Amendment” in 2022.  
Yet the greater Boston metropolitan area has also seen wage growth slow over the last year far more rapidly than the national average, or in the Providence area, according to federal labor data. Kumael Bilgrami, associate economist with Moody’s, blamed Boston’s weak job growth performance on its high cost of living, including housing.
Rhode Island, too, is facing a critical housing shortage that has driven up costs for buyers and renters. The housing crisis is not likely to ease anytime soon; tariffs have sent building material costs skyrocketing, suppressing demand for residential permits, while stricter federal immigration policies make it harder for the construction industry to keep and retain its foreign-born workforce, Bilgrami said.
Yet despite its reputation as a “first in, last out” state when it comes to economic recessions and downturns, Rhode Island has a few advantages over the rest of the country.

Chief among them is the state’s labor market, which has continued to enjoy strong employment growth relative to national and regional averages. The 515,600 jobs recorded in Rhode Island in March 2025 is the highest on record, according to Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training data. While the unemployment rate has ticked up to 4.8% as of March, and is expected to hit 5% by the end of 2025, Rhode Island continues to outperform the country and neighboring states, Massachusetts and Connecticut.
Another advantage for the state’s job market is its diversity of industries, which offers some “insulation” from the consequences of tariffs, Bilgrami said.
Rhode Island boasts an outsized share of finance, education and health care jobs relative to its total labor market, which will be shielded from tariff policies more than other industries like manufacturing.
“We think health care is going to remain relatively stable,” Mandel said.
Job growth forecast for Rhode Island through fiscal 2030 remains relatively unchanged from the last Revenue Estimating Conference in November. Moody’s has revised its projections for state employment upwards slightly since November.
Also consistent with November forecasts are the state’s “housing starts,” or increases in its housing supply, which remain low through the end of the decade, but not much worse now than six months previously.
The forecast does not account for slashing up to $880 billion in federal Medicaid spending nationwide, which would have dramatic consequences in Rhode Island, where federal funds supply more than half of the state’s annual Medicaid budget. The updated financial projections also don’t consider other federal funding cuts beyond the firing of 400,000 federal workers, most of whom are not based out of Rhode Island.
The May Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference continues through May 9, when budget crunchers will update the amount of budget surplus, or deficit, expected heading into fiscal 2026, and beyond.

HB 247, sponsored by Rep. David Standridge, R-Hayden and called the Gulf of America Act, would have required all state and local entities and their employees to refer to the body of water as the “Gulf of America,” following President Donald Trump’s preference.
“We know the president did an executive order changing the name, and all the federal agencies are using that they’ve officially adopted, that the federal agencies have also since that time,” Standridge said to the committee, adding that some states have moved to change the name.

The legislation, which passed the House on April 18, would have also mandated that reasonable efforts be made to update pre-existing resources, unless it imposes an operational or financial burden on the entities. An exception allowed the term “Gulf of Mexico” to be used in academic instruction for historical purposes in public K-12 schools and institutions of higher education.
Democratic senators on the committee asked about the cost of implementing the name change. Senator Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove, said the bill’s fiscal note states it would increase “administrative obligations” of state and local governments, but it does not state the amount.
“We’re supposed to be good stewards of the taxpayers’ dollars. So, do we have any idea how much of this is going to cost the taxpayers?” Coleman asked.
Standridge said “that is unknown” because the bill provides an exception if it would “impose an operational or financial burden” on state and local government.
The committee deadlocked on whether to report the bill on a 4-4 tie, effectively killing it. 
In response to the bill and President Donald Trump’s executive order, the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico plans to change its name to the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf. The move was first reported by Lagniappe Daily.
“This change reflects the museum’s commitment to celebrating the rich history, ecology, and economic impact of this incredible body of water. Known by many names throughout its history, the Gulf has played a profound role in shaping the economy and culture of Mobile and other coastal communities from Texas to Florida,” said Karen Poth, executive director, in a statement on Tuesday.
The museum plans to implement the change in stages, according to Jason Johnson, a spokesperson for the Museum.  Physical printed materials will be updated as new orders are placed, and digital platforms are in the process of being changed.
While the name change is not expected to create new costs for the museum, updates to signage could cost approximately $40,000. 
There are currently no plans to update the name in existing or developing exhibits due to the extensive costs involved. Future exhibits will use “Gulf of America,” and an additional exhibit will reflect the name change and the Gulf’s historical names.

Glenn Youngkin's Spirit of Virginia PAC.

Youngkin’s political adviser under fire as extortion allegations rock Virginia GOP

After a Tumblr account with the same name as Reid’s shared sexually explicit images of men, Gov. Glenn Youngkin asked Reid to drop out of the race last Friday. Reid, who wasn’t in any of the online photos and has denied that the account is his, refused, saying he “won’t back down.” He also accused Youngkin’s PAC of extortion and some members of his party of attacking him because of his sexual identity.
“Let’s be honest: It’s because I’m openly gay and I have never bowed down to the establishment and I will not,” Reid said in a video response. 
So-called sex scandals involving heterosexual men are not new in U.S. politics. From dozens of members of Congress to presidents including Thomas Jeffferson, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, most of their political careers survived scrutiny from constituents and colleagues. 
The same isn’t generally true for women in the political arena, where cultural norms about gender and sexuality have often prompted heightened scrutiny and scorn for female candidates and lawmakers. 
Former California congresswoman Katie Hill resigned after her nude images were shared on a right-wing blog in what she called “a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation,” and her admission of an extramarital affair with a woman campaign staffer. 
Virginia’s own Susanna Gibson faced online harassment and a chorus of calls to drop out of her 2023 state House of Delegates race when her sexually explicit live-stream video with her ex-husband, which they released to a limited audience on a porn site, was recorded and shared widely without their consent. 
“We have that culture of ‘boys will be boys’” said Virginia Wesleyan University professor Leslie Caughell, whose work focuses on the intersection of gender and politics. “Gibson (and others) didn’t get that treatment because ‘women aren’t supposed to do this.’” 
In his recently posted videos since the news broke, Reid has repeatedly emphasized that he is being targeted for his sexuality. 
“He knows that the rules that apply to a heterosexual man don’t apply to him,” Caughell said. 
“I am sickened and outraged at the weeks of veiled accusations and attacks on my family,” Reid said in a video posted to his campaign’s Facebook page Sunday. “I’m not going to continue to answer a never ending parade of questions and false accusations from people who we now know are solely motivated to stage a coup against a gay man, whom they didn’t want to be their nominee, but didn’t have the guts to run against.”
In a form of protest over the controversy, Phil Kazmierczak, a member of Youngkin’s LGBTQ+ Advisory Board, resigned from his position over the weekend.
Kazmierczak said in his resignation letter that he was “deeply shocked” Youngkin “would involve himself in a diabolical attack of this nature.” 
Even as Reid’s campaign emerged, this year’s legislative session showed that many Virginia Republican elected officials do not appear to support same-sex marriage. Though such unions are federally protected by a near-decade-old U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Virginia’s state constitution still has a defunct ban on them. 
A Democrat-led effort to undo this is underway and earlier this year, most Republicans in the House and the state Senate either voted against the measure or abstained from voting. It will need to pass both chambers again next year, where, should Reid become lieutenant governor, he could be a potential tie-breaking vote. All seats in the House are up for election in November.
Democrats have argued that without removing the ban, Virginians’ marriages could be at risk if the Supreme Court reversed its stance on same-sex marriage — a possibility Justice Clarence Thomas has expressed interest in doing.
If Reid were to drop out, the Republican Party of Virginia’s state central committee members would need to select someone to run in his stead. June 17 is the deadline for candidates from both or third parties to qualify for the November ballots. 
 Weaponizing sexuality in political contexts

Like Reid, defying critics to stay in the race is familiar ground for Gibson, who narrowly lost her 2023 House campaign in the competitive 57th District.

Though she said she agreed to her ex-husband’s request to live-stream sex acts on a porn website, they did not consent to it being recorded and shared beyond their initial, limited audience. After an anonymous “Republican operative” sent the content to The Washington Post in 2023 just before early voting started in Virginia, an echo of pundits noted potential uphill battle for her campaign. The Republican Party of Virginia later sent out mailers with screenshots from the live stream. 
She, like Reid, didn’t back down.
But behind the scenes, she endured the trauma of the situation along with subsequent online harassment. She said she’d received death threats and people loitered outside her home during the scandal. At one point a false call was placed to law enforcement, resulting in officers showing up at her house. The act, referred to as “swatting,” is often a tactic to target or harass public figures or activists. 
Following the election, she laid low before later emerging with a PAC dedicated to combatting the nonconsensual sharing of intimate digital images. A model policy the group wrote has been carried and advanced through both Republican and Democrat-leaning states. Gibson consulted with Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax, to adjust the statute of limitations on prosecuting “revenge porn” and other such crimes in Virginia. 
At the federal level, a bill to punish people who publish revenge porn — whether actual images of targeted individuals or artificially-generated ones — has recently cleared congress and is on its way to Trump’s desk. 
While the Tumblr account purported to be Reid’s shared other people’s content, it’s unclear if they had consented.
Virginia’s extortion laws make it a crime to threaten a person’s reputation, safety, property or immigration status to gain money, property or financial benefit. It’s a Class 5 felony in the state to use threats, accusations of criminal conduct or the misuse of immigration documents as leverage for personal or monetary gain. Potential legal battles could be on the horizon if Reid does pursue a suit against the governor’s PAC for alleged extortion. Reid’s lawyer has also sent a cease and desist letter to Moran. 
Political analysts have posited that as technology evolves and younger people enter politics, the risk of digital sexual content being used against candidates may increase. The sharing of intimate images to publicly shame or tarnish someone most often happens to women, multiple studies show, but it can happen to anyone. 
Gibson’s perspective on Reid’s predicament is nuanced, she said, because he used his platform as a radio host to call her a “legislative hooker” two years ago during the scandal she was at the center of. Still, she understands the myriad of feelings he may be coping with now as some in his own party have turned on him, and said it’s unacceptable for him to be targeted because he’s gay. 
“The attacks on Reid for his sexual expression are completely inappropriate and incredibly harmful and damaging, not only to him, but to his family and to the democratic process,” she said.
Gibson also took aim at Matt Moran, a Youngkin adviser who is involved with the governor’s PAC. 
“This is the second state election in a row that Matt Moran and Glenn Youngkin have attacked a candidate that they did not like on their sexuality,” she said. “It raises concerns for future elections and leadership of, honestly, both parties being willing to weaponize people’s sexuality and sexual expression in order to achieve some kind of partisan political outcome.” 
From her own experience, to “sexting” that becomes public, to the allegations against Reid which he’s so far denied, she worries these situations may discourage  people from running for office.
It’s something Caughill wonders about too — particularly concerning women and LGBTQ+ prospective politicians.
“It seems like standards for personal behavior don’t apply evenly to all candidates,” she said. “So you have to wonder if you’re a woman or you’re gay and you’re thinking about running, you might have concerns about what somebody could dig up about you to try to make it into an issue.”
As to Reid’s situation specifically, she said it shows where some of his party falls on supporting LGBTQ+ issues and people. Earlier this year, Reid’s ticket-mates Attorney General Jason Miyares and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears joined Youngkin to boost support for lawmakers’ efforts to ban transgender student athletes from school sports. 
“I think (we’re) seeing some of the Republican Party’s discomfort with many of these transgender and gay issues. Having gay candidates as a voice for their party, at least to some segments, can pose a problem,” Caughell said. “You have to wonder, would Governor Youngkin have been so quick to ask him to step aside if he had been a heterosexual man?”

Kennedy Jr. speaks at a news conference on April 22. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attracted notice — and in some quarters, outrage — for remarks about autism, a topic he’s clashed with scientists about for years.
Kennedy held an April 16 press conference pegged to a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that found the prevalence of autism rising to 1 in 31 among 8-year-olds, the latest in a series of increases in recent decades.
Kennedy said “autism destroys families” and is an “individual tragedy as well.”
Kennedy said many autistic children were “fully functional” and had “regressed” into autism “when they were 2 years old. And these are kids who will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”
He also said: “Most cases now are severe. Twenty-five percent of the kids who are diagnosed with autism are nonverbal, non-toilet-trained, and have other stereotypical features.”
Medical experts, along with people on the autism spectrum, told PolitiFact that Kennedy’s portrayal was skewed. A 2023 study written by CDC officials and university researchers found that one-quarter of people on the autism spectrum have severe limitations. But this is on the high end of studies, and many people in that one-quarter of the autism population do not have the limitations Kennedy mentioned.
The vast majority of people on the spectrum do not have those severe challenges.
“I wish he would spend some time with parents of other autistic children, and well-regarded scientists who have studied this condition for decades,” said David Mandell, a University of Pennsylvania psychiatry professor and director of the Penn Center for Mental Health. “He has a fixed, myopic view.”
The Department of Health and Human Services did not provide data on what share of people with autism diagnoses are unable to do the things Kennedy described.
“Secretary Kennedy remains committed to working toward a society where people with autism have access to meaningful opportunities, appropriate supports, and the full respect and recognition they deserve,” department press secretary Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano told PolitiFact. “His statements emphasized the need for increased research into environmental factors contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses, not to stigmatize individuals with autism or their families.”
The Washington Post reported that an HHS spokesperson said Kennedy “was referring to those that are severely affected by this chronic condition” and that “this was in no way a general characterization.”
We took a closer look at the available data and research.
What is autism spectrum disorder?
At root, “autism is a difference in how your child’s brain works that shapes how they interact with the world around them,” according to the Cleveland Clinic. People with autism diagnoses, the clinic says, “may excel more in certain areas and need more support in other areas compared to their neurotypical peers.”
Over the years, autism’s definition and diagnosis has changed.
In the 1950s and 1960s, “it is very likely that many people with profound autism were misdiagnosed with ‘mental retardation,’ a term in use at the time, or schizophrenia, while other autistic people probably got no diagnosis at all,” said John J. Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College politics professor, author of the book “The Politics of Autism: Navigating the Contested Spectrum,” and a father of an autistic son who’s about to graduate from college.
In more recent decades, the diagnostic criteria for autism have broadened, producing a spectrum ranging from severe impacts to more modest ones. Today’s definition encompasses “individuals with milder symptoms, stronger language skills, and higher IQs,” said Christopher Banks, president and CEO of the Autism Society of America.
How common are the more limiting forms of autism?
Autism’s expanded definition means a minority of people on the spectrum have the kinds of severe limitations Kennedy cited, though it’s hard to say how many.
The highest total we found comes from a 2023 federal report, written by CDC officials and university researchers. It found that 26.7% of 8-year-olds with autism had “profound” autism, a newly framed (and not universally accepted) definition that included children who were nonverbal, were minimally verbal, or had an IQ below 50. (“Average” IQ is considered 90 to 109.)
People with profound autism “will require lifetime, round-the-clock care,” said Judith Ursitti, co-founder and president of the Profound Autism Alliance, a nonprofit. Ursitti said her 21-year-old son “is not headed towards employment or a career in poetry or baseball. Acknowledging this fact is important, as this population is often excluded from media portrayals and research.”
Other estimates are lower.
A study published in 2024, by researchers at the University of Utah and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, looked at 1,368 U.S. children with autism. When parents were asked whether they would characterize their child’s autism as “severe,” 10.1% said yes. Among this group of children with “severe” autism, a minority — 38% — were classified as having a “severe” intellectual disability.
“Even among those with an intellectual disability, there’s huge variability,” Mandell said. “People with Down syndrome have an intellectual disability but often are quite capable and can do all the things RFK points to.”
The CDC published data in 2020 showing that 42% of people with autism had an IQ in the average or higher range, and another study has found that this figure could be as high as 60%.
Zoe Gross, the director of advocacy at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, said limited available data suggests that Kennedy’s characterization is exaggerated.
Gross, who is on the spectrum herself, said a 2017 study found that 61% of people on the spectrum who were studied were employed. As for baseball, the Special Olympics, which was founded by Kennedy’s family and includes competitors who are on the spectrum, includes softball. At least two people who played major league baseball, Tarik El-Abour and Jim Eisenreich, were public about their autism diagnoses.
Gross said there is no official data on autistic poets, but she was aware of the poet DJ Savarese, a nonspeaking but highly literate advocate. Gross was also unable to find data on dating, but she said she’s married, and she pointed to the Netflix reality show “Love on the Spectrum,” which follows autistic people’s dating lives. It is now in its third season.
As for not using a toilet unassisted, the 2024 study that analyzed 1,368 U.S. children with autism and found that 10.1% were considered “severe” found that 67% of those in the “severe” category had trouble bathing or dressing, which, if generalizable to the entire autistic population, would be less than 7%. Another study found urinary incontinence reported by 12.5% of the autistic people studied and fecal incontinence by 7.9%.
Eric M. Garcia, who is on the spectrum and who has written the book “We’re Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation,” was covering Kennedy’s remarks as Washington bureau chief of The Independent. Hearing his words “felt so demoralizing,” Garcia told PolitiFact. “A lot of people will respond by saying, ‘He didn’t mean autistic people like you.’ But that doesn’t make it any better.”

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA national conservative group on Monday appealed to the Vermont Supreme Court a lower court decision dismissing their challenge to noncitizen voting in Burlington.The appeal was filed by the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections on behalf of Burlington residents Karen Rowell and Michele Morin. It prolongs the group’s lawsuit, first filed in June 2024, that challenges a Burlington charter change allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections.“Vermont’s Constitution is clear: when it comes to votes concerning state matters, only U.S. citizens have the right to decide,” Tim Murtaugh, a spokesperson for the conservative group, said in a press release. “RITE is proud to stand with Vermont citizens to defend the rule of law and fight the left’s creeping endorsement of noncitizen voting.”Joe Magee, the deputy chief of staff for Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak and a spokesperson for the city, said that the city “is confident that our all legal resident voting provision is defensible, and we look forward to a favorable ruling by the Court.”Burlington voters in 2023 approved a charter change to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. The Vermont Legislature overrode a veto by Republican Gov. Phil Scott to enact it several months later.Under the city’s charter, legal noncitizen residents — green card holders and residents with eligible work permits, for example — have the right to vote in local government and school board elections and ballot questions.RITE’s 2024 lawsuit alleges that Section 42 of the Vermont Constitution forbids noncitizen voting on statewide matters and makes Burlington’s charter change “unconstitutional and void.”READ MORE





 


Judge rejects effort to block noncitizen voting in Burlington

Because school budgets have statewide implications — school budgets are determined locally but are ultimately funded by the state — only U.S. citizens should be allowed to vote on them, the group’s suit claims.Chittenden County Superior Court Judge Samuel Hoar Jr. dismissed the case in February. The RITE group is now asking the state’s highest court to weigh in.The case is being headed by Brady Toensing, a former vice chair of the state GOP who also served in the Department of Justice during President Donald Trump’s first term. Attorneys Patrick Strawbridge and James Hasson are also listed on the appeal.While noncitizen voting is not permitted in federal elections, Vermont is one of several states to allow it in local elections. In addition to Burlington, both Winooski and Montpelier allow noncitizen voting.The national and state branches of the Republican Party sued both of those cities over the issue in 2021, alleging that their noncitizen voting measures were unconstitutional. Both lawsuits were eventually dismissed, though one was appealed. In January 2023, the Vermont Supreme Court upheld a 2022 Washington Superior civil court decision to dismiss the suit against Montpelier. The Supreme Court ruled then that Montpelier’s charter provision did not violate the state’s constitution.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Conservative group challenging noncitizen voting in Burlington appeals to Vermont Supreme Court.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/election-day-burlington-8-20221108.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 16:09:17.570475

(Courtesy of Idaho National Laboratory)Officials with the state of Idaho and the U.S. Department of Energy have agreed to a waiver of the state’s 1995 nuclear waste settlement agreement, the two sides announced Tuesday.
The new waiver will allow for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho for the purposes of conducting research at Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho, officials said.
The waiver specifically allows for a high burnout nuclear fuel cask from the North Anna Power Station, a commercial nuclear power plant located in Virginia, to be sent to Idaho National Laboratory for research, according to a press release issued Tuesday.

The waiver was necessary because the 1995 settlement agreement called for limiting shipments of, and removing certain types of, spent nuclear fuel in Idaho. 
“The collaborative effort between the state of Idaho, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Idaho National Laboratory showcases our commitment to advancing nuclear energy research while upholding the goals of the 1995 Settlement Agreement,” Little said in a written statement. 
“We are proud to support innovation in nuclear energy that will support national security and energy independence into the future.”
  Research at INL to support licensing for extended storage of spent fuel at nuclear power plants 

Idaho National Laboratory, or INL, is one of 17 Department of Energy national labs, and it employs or contacts with about 6,400 researchers and support staff. 
Much of the nuclear research and energy research conducted by Idaho National Laboratory occurs at a vast research complex referred to as “the site” that is located in the eastern Idaho desert, between the town of Arco and Idaho Falls.

“Idaho National Laboratory is DOE’s lead lab for nuclear energy research and development, and it is critical that we continue to grow this research capacity and maintain American competitiveness,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a written statement. “This agreement between the State of Idaho and DOE ensures the lab can continue its cutting-edge research to advance nuclear technology, helping to meet President Trump’s commitment to unleash American energy dominance.” 
In today’s press release, state and federal officials said the research will provide data to support licensing for the extended storage of spent fuel at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states.
“As the nation’s center for nuclear energy research and development, we look forward to utilizing our unique facilities and expertise to support this critical national need,” Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner said in a written statement. “We are thankful to the Department of Energy and the state of Idaho for entrusting us with the safe and secure execution of our vital mission.”

As part of the new waiver, Idaho National Laboratory will also be allowed to safely manage small amounts of spent nuclear fuel from domestic university reactors. Without the waiver, some U.S. universities could have been forced to shut down their research reactors due to limits on spent fuel storage, officials said.
Signed in October 1995 by then-Gov. Phil Batt, the 1995 settlement agreement resolved a lawsuit filed by the state amid public concern about environmental and health resulting from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho. The lawsuit was filed in order to keep Idaho from becoming a dumping ground for the country’s spent nuclear fuel, according to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality.  
The new waiver relaxes the annual limit on the amount of spent nuclear fuel and materials that can come into Idaho, officials said. The shipment could occur in 2027 under the waiver.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A bill that would ensure that credits earned from prison-based classes count toward professional licensing requirements has passed in the Florida House of Representatives and is headed to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ desk for consideration.
The House on Tuesday unanimously passed the Senate version (SB 472), sponsored by Central Florida Republican Keith Truenow, which passed unanimously in that chamber earlier this month.
The measure requires the Correctional Education Program (CEP) within the Department of Corrections to provide educational programming to inmates in state correctional facilities. The CEP provides 92 career and technical education courses in 37 vocational trades that are aligned to Florida’s in-demand occupations, including barbering, cosmetology, electrical contracting, landscaping, plumbing, and HVAC contracting, according to a bill analysis.
The CEP has awarded 36,689 certificates and industry-recognized credentials over the last four years. However, these certificates were largely only valid while the people receiving them were incarcerated, and they are not recognized outside of prison, according to the Florida Policy Institute.
The House measure (HB 195) is sponsored by Miami-Dade Democrat Kevin Chambliss and Seminole County Republican Rachel Plakon.
“I’m reminded of the women who are girlfriends, who are wives and even the moms of the loved ones who are incarcerated,” said Plakon. “And the theme that comes up again and again is hope. They say, ‘Please give them something to hope for.’ And I think they’re right, because when someone has served their time and they want to choose a different path, let’s give them the education, let’s give them something to hope for a second chance.”
Chambliss has sponsored a version of this bill for the past several sessions, calling it a “labor of love.”
“We know that our prisons are overcrowded, but we also know that our  labor force has in-demand jobs that are readily available. This bill addresses that,” he said.
The measure is similar to a proposal that Gov. DeSantis vetoed last year, with one major omission.
In his veto message, DeSantis specifically referred to a provision that would have reduced the time from five years to three years that the Barbers’ Board and Board of Cosmetology could use a criminal conviction as ground to deny licenses. He wrote in his message that “there may be good reason for the board to have this information before making a decision regarding a particular applicant.”
This year’s bill does not include that provision.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)Former Doña Ana County Magistrate Court Judge Jose Luis “Joel” Cano and his wife, Nancy Cano, were released on separate $10,000 bonds Tuesday in connection to federal charges of tampering with evidence in an immigration case.
The Canos appeared in U.S. Federal District Court in Las Cruces Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Gregory J. Fouratt. Joel Cano faces one charge of tampering with evidence while Nancy Cano faces a charge of conspiracy to tamper with evidence. The couple’s charges relate to their alleged connection to Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, a Venezuelan national prosecutors allege resides in the U.S. unlawfully and has connections to the Tren de Aragua gang. 
The Canos have been in custody at the Doña Ana County Detention Center since Friday, according to the jail’s website. They appeared in court Tuesday in shackles, alongside over 70 other people facing criminal charges who were waiting to have their cases heard. The room had standing room only, and viewers included several of the Canos’ neighbors.
Fouratt agreed to release both defendants on $10,000 secured bonds, on the condition that they: provide DNA samples; notify the court of any address changes; surrender their passports and eschew new travel documents; don’t associate with Ortega-Lopez and avoid contact with possible witnesses to the case; don’t leave Doña Ana County without his approval; and provide pretrial service officials with information about their renters.
The Canos told Fouratt that they own nine rental properties and all but one are occupied. The judge said they must ensure they rent only to U.S. citizens or immigrants legally allowed to live in the U.S. Fouratt also said they must provide pretrial services with information about their renters and any overnight guests outside of immediate family.
The judge permitted the couple to continue to reside together in their long-time home, despite prosecutors’ worries that they might discuss the case. Fouratt said he could not legally restrict topics of conversation between married couples. 
“I want you to have a chance to convince any other judge you see” that the decisions the couple made related to this case were outside of their usual “decision-making,” Fouratt said during the hearing.
The U.S. Department of Justice announced the charges against the Canos in the same news release in which they announced the arrest of a Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan for allegedly allowing a Mexican immigrant charged with domestic violence to temporarily avoid arrest by federal agents.
The Canos have not yet entered pleas to the charges, and neither of them have yet been scheduled for an arraignment hearing, according to court records.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee and top health care officials unveiled a new set of plans to mend Rhode Island’s ailing primary care system Tuesday, with strategies like grants for helping clinics serve more patients and asking big commercial insurers to pay more.
The Ocean State’s dearth of primary care doctors won’t be solved entirely, or even quickly. And the plan announced at a State House news conference by McKee and his Health Care System Planning Cabinet came a day before Anchor Medical Associates closes its Warwick office with two more set to close by June 30.
“We know that fixing these challenges will not happen overnight,” said Richard Charest, secretary of the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS). “These problems have developed over very many years, and we take and it will take time to rectify that.” 
The state is short about 300 primary care providers, according to Dr. Elizabeth Lange, a pediatrician at Hasbro who attended the conference. 
The all payer claims database shows Rhode Island currently has about 520 primary care providers, said Dr. Jerry Larkin, the state health department’s director.
“So right now, we’re a little bit short,” Larkin told the crowd.
Solutions offered — like bigger primary care payments from commercial insurers, speeding up the Medicaid rate review process, and $5 million in grants for primary care practices — are all part of what McKee called “a full deep dive into all factors that are related to primary care delivery.”
“There’s still important work ahead, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to identify other strategies to strengthen our primary care system,” McKee said. “We know that it is alarming when people in the state of Rhode Island are unable to find a primary care doctor, and we’re going to do everything we can to connect them with the help that they are looking for.”
Anchor Medical Associates on Wednesday will close its Warwick office — the first of the physician group’s three locations which will all be shuttered by June 30. The Anchor closures announced earlier in April will affect about 25,000 patients, mostly children, who now need to find new primary care doctors. Charest told reporters he’d “rather not get into the specifics of that practice,” but characterized the closure being due to “internal operational challenges.”
“If we had been notified earlier, we may have been able to help stabilize that practice,” Charest said. “I think that they were at a position that they had no liquidity at the end.”


McKee’s big ideas to tackle primary care crisis
Accelerating Medicaid rate review for primary care.
Requiring commercial health insurers to increase funding for primary care reimbursements
Reducing red tape by easing prior authorization requirements
Providing grants to help primary care practices serve additional patients and hire new providers
Strengthening fiscal oversight of Rhode Island’s health care system
Expanding the primary care student loan forgiveness program


Low reimbursement the state’s Medicaid program pays providers have frequently been cited as a major contributing factor in the state’s primary care troubles. McKee said he is moving to stabilize the state’s primary care system by filing a budget amendment that would require the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC) to complete the primary care provider rate review process on an accelerated timeline. The rate review would be completed within a year instead of the usual two afforded to the rate review process for human services.
Cory King, the health insurance commissioner, said the rate review would be completed by September 2026 on the new timeline.   
“I don’t set rates. I make recommendations after data driven analysis,” King said. 
That data and King’s recommendations inform EOHHS’ annual budget ask of the governor, which is submitted to the General Assembly in January. If the budget passes with the rates intact, it then goes to the federal government, which pays about half of Medicaid rate increases. If approved by the feds, the rate increases would take effect at the start of fiscal year 2028.
“There’s some administrative tasks that have to happen before the actual rates are implemented,” Kristin Sousa, the Medicaid program director, told reporters. “Traditionally, when the legislature passes the budget, it’s effective on July 1. In this case, July 1 of 2027, we may not be ready to implement on July 1, but it will retro back to July 1.”
Several studies published on primary care in Rhode Island in recent years, including a 2024 study by the Rhode Island Foundation, have found the Ocean State’s reimbursement rates lag far behind Connecticut and Massachusetts. Could that data be used to inform the rate review process?
“I would say, ‘Share the data with us.’ Cuz I haven’t seen it,” McKee said.
King encouraged people to dig into that report’s numbers a little more. The Rhode Island Foundation report was not exclusively focused on provider reimbursement, he said, but rather “hospitals and patient and operation services.” Yes, reimbursement rates in other New England states are higher, King said, but this is consistent with higher health insurance premiums in those states. 










We know that it is alarming when people in the state of Rhode Island are unable to find a primary care doctor, and we’re going to do everything we can to connect them with the help that they are looking for. 


– Gov. Dan McKee


“In Massachusetts, of the 53 hospitals in the inpatient data set, only six hospitals are actually reimbursed at or above the statewide average, And in Connecticut, of the 26 hospitals in the inpatient data set, only eight of those 26 hospitals are reimbursed at or above that statewide average. So there are great variations that we need to consider when looking at reimbursement rates more granularly.”
Still, King cited the importance of primary care investment as a preventative measure for even more health care spending.
“My position has always been that putting money into primary care is a wise investment, as opposed to, say, putting money into emergency department reimbursement,” King said. “Primary care accounts for approximately 6% of what commercial payers pay for health care business services, but it helps control the other 94%.”
For a more immediate fix, McKee is proposing $5 million in grants to help existing practices serve more patients. Clinics can apply for up to $75,000 to take on new patients or up to $300,000 to hire primary care physicians or “mid-level” providers such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants. 
Applications for grants are available online through May 16.
Separately, the state is imposing new regulations on commercial insurers requiring them to double their primary care spending by 2029. The rules also mandate a 20% reduction in prior authorization requirements to help lower administrative burdens on primary care doctors.
‘Slapdash response’ comes too late
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha blasted McKee’s plans in a press release issued about 40 minutes after the press conference ended. 
“The Governor’s health care announcement today is a slapdash response to political and public pressure because of the dissolution of Anchor Medical, and unfortunately, I expected nothing more,” Neronha said.
Neronha, who has established himself as one of McKee’s most vocal critics, said the governor is “hanging his hat” on conducting future studies and reviews. 
“Our PCPs are overworked and overburdened by a state health care system that doesn’t support them,” Neronha said. “Our residents are scrambling to find primary care physicians to care for them through illnesses and fill prescriptions for live-preserving medications. We are in crisis. And some of us have been sounding the alarm for years.”
McKee said at the press event that Rhode Island surpasses many other states for health care access in quality, citing U.S. News and World Report’s ranking of Rhode Island as fifth in the nation in health care overall.
Neronha took issue with McKee’s rosy outlook, saying McKee was “once again showing how out of touch this Governor is with the reality of the situation.”

The resolution comes the same day Trump is slated to return to Michigan in his first visit to the state since retaking the White House last November, with a scheduled rally at Macomb Community College.
Ahead of introducing the resolution Tuesday in the Michigan House, state legislators issued statements decrying Trump for violations of the U.S. Constitution, namely forgoing legal processes in recent deportations. 
The resolution that Democratic state lawmakers are proposing specifically outlines the March deportation of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, where the U.S. Supreme Court has ordered Trump’s administration to “facilitate” his return, which it has not complied with.
Salvadoran officials allow Van Hollen, Abrego Garcia to meet

The Trump administration’s decision to suddenly and without explanation revoke student visas for international students at the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Grand Valley State University is also cause for concern, the resolution reads. And with Trump expressing interest in deporting legal U.S. citizens who are convicted of crimes, the resolution raises concerns that Trump is bypassing the justice system, denying residents protection from government overreach. 
“These cases are representative of a larger policy of reckless abuse of authority to undermine due process and, in turn, the protection of other fundamental American rights such as free speech and freedom of assembly,” the resolution proposed by Michigan state legislators reads.
It is the U.S. House of Representatives sole right to present articles of impeachment outlining supposed offenses by the president and the U.S. Senate’s sole right to hold a subsequent impeachment trial.
The Michigan state House of Representatives has very little oversight on the actions of Trump or his administration, Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) said in a statement sponsoring the resolution supporting impeachment. But state lawmakers are very aware of the sentiments of their districts, Wegela said, and as Trump and his administration act like they are above the checks and balances of government and exempt from the processes of the U.S. legal system, it is the right of state lawmakers to sound alarm bells.
 “Our communities are under assault by this administration, and members of Congress need to take this seriously,” Wegela said. “It is unthinkable that a president would send innocent people to a foreign country’s prison known for its human rights violations. The constitution is clear in regards to due process and the freedom of speech for residents of the United States.”
The news release from Wegela’s office said Reps. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) and Jimmie Wilson Jr. (D-Ypsilanti) have signed on as cosponsors, as well as several others.
The state resolution follows Thanedar’s introduction Monday of a resolution presenting the necessary articles of impeachment to begin an impeachment process, outlining what he called, “unlawful actions [that] have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service.”
Both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate are under Republican control, making any action of Thanedar’s effort unlikely.

Attorneys for the state filed court documents stating their intention to petition the nation’s highest court to overturn a decision from an appellate court that found a state election law conflicted with federal election laws. 
U.S. District Judge Louis Guirrola halted all lower court action until the proceedings with the Supreme Court are completed. 
The Republican National Committee, the state Republican Party and the Libertarian Party of Mississippi sued Secretary of State Michael Watson and local elections officials over a state law that allows election workers to process absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day for up to five days after the election. 
The political parties argue that Congress is the only entity that can set specific parameters for federal elections, while state officials contend that federal law defers to states on specific details for conducting elections.
Judge Guirrola initially ruled in favor of the state, but the plaintiffs appealed. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most conservative appellate courts in the nation, overturned Guirrola’s ruling and struck down the state law. 
Now Mississippi officials are asking the Supreme Court to uphold the state law, a decision that could have broad implications for more than a dozen states that have similar laws on the books. 
The litigation does not impact state or local races, including Mississippi’s current municipal elections. Mississippi’s next federal election will be the 2026 midterm, where all four of Mississippi’s U.S. House members are up for reelection, as well as U.S. Sen.

Glenn Youngkin's Spirit of Virginia PAC. (Photo courtesy of John Reid) In a stunning escalation of Virginia’s Republican infighting, Matt Moran — head of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC — has emerged as the central figure blamed for the widening rift between the governor and John Reid, the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor.
After Reid publicly accused Spirit of Virginia of extortion Sunday without naming Moran, his campaign lawyers fired a cease and desist letter directly at Moran Monday evening, accusing him of making “false and defamatory statements” about Reid — and threatening further legal action. 
Moran has declined multiple requests for comment. 
Meanwhile, pressure is building inside the party for accountability. Several GOP officials are urging the Republican Party of Virginia’s Executive Committee to confidentially review the explicit images that Moran allegedly showed Youngkin — images that reportedly convinced the governor to personally ask Reid to drop out of the race.
The result is a crisis that threatens not only to fracture Virginia Republicans months before Election Day but also to severely damage Youngkin’s national ambitions.
 Reid strikes back

The controversy escalated after Reid, a conservative radio host and the first openly gay statewide candidate from either party in Virginia, posted a spirited video Sunday afternoon on X, formerly Twitter.
“I had certainly hoped that we could put the bigotry and ugliness of last week behind us and unify our Republican ticket this year,” Reid said. “But shockingly, once again representatives of my campaign have been told by the leader of Governor Youngkin’s political organization that the attacks on me will continue unless I drop out of the race for lieutenant governor.”
Hours later, Reid’s legal team delivered a cease-and-desist letter to Moran, laying out accusations of defamation, extortion and reckless disregard for the truth.
“It has come to our attention that you provided information accusing our client of owning a Tumblr account containing unsavory images to multiple news organizations,” the letter reads. 
“While this account shared a common username with our client’s Instagram, he is not and never has been associated with the account.”
Reid’s attorneys said Moran crossed the line into defamation because the statements were “knowingly untrue,” and warned that “continued publication of these false claims would constitute actual malice.”
In a particularly damning passage, the letter alleged that Moran made direct threats in an April 27 conversation with Reid: “You literally said ‘him getting out of the race is the only way it stops.’”
The lawyers further argued that Moran’s accusations gave rise to defamation and defamation per se, noting that falsely alleging Reid was linked to criminal behavior “is so egregious that it is assumed to harm the plaintiff’s reputation without further need to prove harm.”
They demanded Moran “immediately cease and desist” from making or publishing any additional false claims, and instructed him to preserve all documents related to the case, including communications with consulting firms and journalists.
 GOP officials demand action

As the legal drama escalated, some Republican officials across the state voiced alarm at Moran’s handling of the situation — and called for transparency.
In a joint email sent to Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Mark Peake obtained by The Mercury, Rick Buchanan, chairman of the 5th Congressional District GOP Committee, and John Massoud, his counterpart in the 6th District, urged the party leadership to allow members of the State Central Committee’s Executive Committee to review any alleged evidence confidentially.
“As leaders of the Republican Party of Virginia, we are very concerned about our upcoming elections,” Buchanan and Massoud wrote. “Accusations have been made about our Lt. Governor nominee that are very serious. People are lining up on each side behind either the accuser or the accused, yet the evidence behind the allegations being made have not been forthcoming.”
They stressed the need for unity, warning, “In order for us to win this November, this affair must be put behind us. … Giving us the actual facts will make that possible.”
In a phone interview Tuesday, Buchanan went even further, telling The Mercury that Youngkin must fire Moran to salvage party unity.
“Either way we come out of this, it has caused a lot of turmoil within the party,” he said. “And I am very disappointed that the governor would listen to (Moran) without knowing the facts.”
Amid the unfolding controversy, an event scheduled for Wednesday at Atlas 42 in Henrico County featuring the full Republican statewide ticket — with Youngkin billed as a special guest — was abruptly canceled.
But Reid, undeterred, confirmed in a text message Tuesday that he still plans to go forward with the rally, even without his running mates.
 Moran silent as criticism mounts

In a text message Tuesday, Moran declined to comment. 
But Virginia GOP figures like Casey Flores, founder of the Richmond chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, the nation’s largest Republican organization dedicated to representing LGBTQ conservatives, made clear that Moran’s position is becoming untenable.
“I think that this is blowing back on Governor Youngkin and Matt Moran more than they ever expected,” Flores said in a phone interview. “Matt’s being kind of the one-hit wonder — he had Youngkin’s victory in 2021, but I think Youngkin won in spite of him, not because of him.”
Flores accused Moran of trying to “scuttle anything that doesn’t make him money” and said his actions were now damaging the party’s broader chances.
“In the age of Trump, people really don’t care about all this, even if the accusations against John Reid were true, which they are not,” Flores said. “Firing Matt really is the only appropriate thing for Governor Youngkin to do.”

Moran, 36, has been a fixture in Virginia politics for over a decade. After managing one rural delegate’s campaign and serving as a legislative aide for another, he rose quickly — first as spokesman for then-House Speaker William J. Howell, R-Stafford, then as chief of staff to Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights.
He later joined Youngkin’s campaign and served as director of policy and legislative affairs in the governor’s office — but notably without taking a salary from the state. Instead, Moran stayed on leave from two consulting firms he had ownership interests in: Creative Direct and Link Public Affairs.
Critics said the arrangement created serious conflicts of interest.
“There’s certainly a cause for him to try to make money, both within the administration and outside of Spirit of Virginia through his other companies,” Scott Pio, chairman of the Loudoun County GOP Committee, said in a phone interview.
Pio, whose committee hosted a rally for Reid in Sterling Monday evening, suggested that Moran’s dual loyalties allowed him to shape Virginia policy while benefiting financially. 
“Since Matt doesn’t have a statewide client, he decides to throw this bomb,” Pio said, referencing the Reid controversy, which blew up just days after Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity — a client of Moran’s — dropped out for health reasons last week. 
He also argued that firing Moran was a necessary step to rebuild trust: “Youngkin being a businessman, he should know when to hire and fire quickly. He should not keep people around that are being inappropriate.”
 Youngkin’s 2028 calculus and GOP damage control

Even before the Reid episode, Moran’s unpaid status within the administration had drawn scrutiny. In 2022, Youngkin’s chief counsel Richard Cullen in an interview with The Washington Post defended Moran’s arrangement, saying, “He would have been the hottest guy in Richmond (for lobbying). But Matt did the opposite and to his financial detriment.”
Moran declined an interview request for the same story but at the time issued a statement through Youngkin’s press office defending his arrangement. 
“I am on leave from all companies and as a result do not have clients with business before the governor or state government,” Moran said. “I formalized this arrangement with counsel’s office and I am fully committed to my service to the governor and the people of Virginia. It is a privilege to have the opportunity to serve the governor and work on behalf of the commonwealth.” 
His statement did not explain why he chose to forgo a state salary.
Now, however, political observers say Moran’s continued presence could be politically fatal — not just in Virginia, but nationally, as Youngkin positions himself for a possible 2028 White House run.
David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said the scandal “has done tremendous damage” to Youngkin and the GOP in Virginia.
“It reveals a real limit to Youngkin’s power in the state GOP and has exposed an ugly underbelly of the Republican party here,” Richards said. “Someone in Youngkin’s circle will have to take the fall. It does not look like Reid will bow out.”
Richards also noted the ongoing silence from Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee for governor, who has yet to comment publicly on the controversy engulfing her running mate.
“Her response so far raises a lot of questions about her ability to lead and make tough choices,” Richards said.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Youngkin, Earle-Sears, and Spirit of Virginia continued to dodge public comment. Reid, meanwhile, remains defiant and shows no sign of abandoning the ticket.

The crime novel explores the theme of Native American women who are missing or murdered.
Rendon is a member of the White Earth Nation in northwest Minnesota who now lives in Minneapolis.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The story begins with the protagonist, Quill, a Native American wife and mother of two, who is jogging on the reservation when she hears a woman scream. That scream sends her into panic, which later leads to an investigation.
Rendon told the admiring audience that she is a crime junkie who loves to create page-turners, and that her goal with the new book wasn’t to provide a sociological study of indigenous life, but to tell a good story.
However, Rendon framed the book’s accounts of missing Native American women taken from a reservation and an infant kidnapped from a Walmart to the movement recognizing the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Relatives (MMIW/R) 
Early on, Crow, Quill’s husband, expresses concern about his wife risking her safety chasing  down information on the possible identity of the woman she heard screaming:
“We’ve been hearing these horror stories of four thousand, maybe five thousand women missing across Canada. Missing down here. The stories of what has happened to women and children” – he emphasized children – “in the man camps over the Dakotas. And they are here now.” He jabbed two fingers onto the table when he said the word now. “Those same men are here now.” He jabbed the table again. “I don’t want anyone from my family to go missing. To end up dead in a ditch or a river. No. Not on my watch.”
When the book club members had an opportunity to ask Rendon questions, they didn’t focus on the plotline of the story but on the larger MMIW/R issue, what’s behind it and what could be done to address it.
In mainstream culture, Rendon responded, Native Americans are seen as invisible and their problems have not been taken as seriously.
“When I go out East to talk, most people out there think we’re all dead; that we disappeared with, I don’t know, the Black Hills gold rush, which also makes it easier for us to disappear if people don’t think we exist,” she said. “How can you disappear if you don’t exist?”
Although the MMIW/R issue has benefited from more public discussions, such as the upcoming May 5 MMIW/R Day of Awareness, Rendon said, when she was recently in Madison, she met a college professor who had never heard of the issue.
“Where They Last Saw Her” is an example of a work of fiction that raises awareness of a real crisis and provides insights into subcultures and their struggles.
In 2018, as part of a statewide program called Wisconsin Reads, several book clubs around the state collectively read and discussed “The Round House” by Louise Erdrich, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota. That book also raised awareness of struggles on Native American reservations and, in particular, the complication of prosecuting a crime when there are competing jurisdictional authorities between a tribal nation and county and state authorities.
Rendon is also the author of the “Cash Blackbear” series, which involves a Native American 19-year-old woman who solves crimes in the Red River area of Minnesota/North Dakota in the 1970s. She said her editor at Bantam asked her about writing another book outside the series.
“She said, ‘Well, what’s the current issue in Indian Country?’ and I said, ‘missing and murdered Indian women.’”
However, Rendon was initially reluctant to write a story around the MMIW/R issue.
“I said, ‘there’s no resolution. If somebody’s missing or murdered, there’s no happy ending,” she said. “There’s no resolution to the story. They’re either dead or they’re still missing.’”
Rendon’s story is set in Minnesota at a fictional tribe on the outskirts of Duluth, Minnesota, where in real life there had been a major pipeline project on a reservation in the area, like the one in her book — the replacement of Line 3 by Enbridge on the Fond du Lac Reservation, completed in 2021.
Prior to the Line 3 permit being approved, there had been concerns by Native American groups about man camps and violence and harassment against Native women.
A 2021 article by The Guardian, “Sexual violence along pipeline route follows Indigenous women’s warnings,” reported that a local crisis center for survivors of violence had “received more than 40 reports about Line 3 workers harassing and assaulting women and girls who live in northwestern Minnesota.”
Rene Ann Goodrich, a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, and a member of the Wisconsin MMIW/R Task Force is one of several Ojibwe women from Northern Wisconsin who have also expressed concern over Enbridge replacing a portion of Line 5, currently located on the Bad River Reservation, but Enbridge has filed for permits to build outside the reservation. Besides environmental concerns, the new project could result in a man camp in the area and possible assaults against Native women.
Rendon said there is a strong relationship between the extractive industry and the MMIW/R issue, and she makes a strong correlation between the two in her book.
“Anytime you have an extractive industry, like the pipelines, gold mines, uranium mines, anytime you have an extractive industry where large groups of men are pulled in to do the extraction, there’s no police force. They show up without their wives and families. They show up without ministers or priests. It’s just like the Wild West,” she said. “There has to be something done about the extractive industries and this use of men in large groups to actually go out and do these extractive industries. I don’t know how you change this. But I think that awareness is a piece of it.”
However, Rendon said she had heard that some oil companies have responded to concerns about man camps by putting men up in hotels with their families.
“Talk about the power of women, right? Bringing your wife and she’ll make you go to church,” she said.
Rendon said it was vital for her to portray Native American women in a community. In the story, three women, Quill and her friends Punk and Gaylyn, often travel together as they pursue information about missing women or help with searches.
“In Native communities, you almost never do anything alone,” she said. “You know, if I’m going to go to the grocery store, somebody’s with me. There’s one family that, if you see them at the pow wow —  if you see them at the grocery store, if you see them downtown, in the courthouse —  it’s the mom, the grandma, the kids, you know; it’s like, it’s a whole group,” she said.
Regarding Native women and community, Rendon notes it was Indigenous/First Nation women in Canada who first gathered together and spoke out about the phenomenon of Indigenous women missing around the man camps of oil pipelines and mining operations.
“I knew that in this story about missing and murdered Indian women, what was important to me was a community of women, and so I knew that it wasn’t going to be just one person,” she said.
Rendon said she has received some criticism for including a male Native American who is abusive.
“We have bad people in our communities, too,” she said, “and then there’s the thing about domestic abuse, it happens in every community and in smaller communities. People know that it happens, but people don’t talk about it, or there’s this secrecy and stuff that happens around it.”
In Minnesota, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) reports there were 716 Indigenous persons missing in that state in 2024, 57% of whom were women.
In Wisconsin the exact number of missing Indigenous persons is not published, in part because the state does not have a clearinghouse like Minnesota for gathering that data.
Rendon praised efforts in Minnesota to create an MMIW/R office that tracks MMIW/R cases, works with families, and provides support and even rewards for information. And she noted that in Minneapolis, the Indigenous Protectors Movement, a branch of the American Indian Movement, is active in putting out flyers and organizing searches for missing persons.
In researching the novel, Rendon said she was surprised by how often white women who went missing were blamed for causing their own victimization through their behavior, including having multiple sexual partners. In Native American communities, she said, there isn’t that cloud of guilt over women.
“The Native community clearly has said, ‘I don’t care what our women were doing, nobody deserves to be trafficked. Nobody deserves to end up dead in a ditch or in a gunny sack in the Red River Valley,’” she said. “So there’s a difference, a cultural difference that I saw, which surprised me.”

The proposal, Senate Bill 484, would allow employers to obtain an injunction and temporary restraining order against anyone who protests at their place of business to the extent of “hindering or preventing” work, using threats or force, or blocking workplace entrances, exits, or public roads and streets. It amends an existing law that centers on protecting employees from harassment, stalking, and violence.
Among the forms of relief available to judges in the bill are no-contact orders and prohibitions on visiting the workplace, punishable as contempt of court, which would open violators to fines and jail time.
“What Senate Bill 484 strives to achieve is a balance between those who want to peacefully protest and those who actually want to go to work and earn a living uninhibited by those that are protesting,” said Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson), a primary sponsor of the bill.
The bill comes amid a flurry of labor activity around the state as union efforts has risen in recent years, with the number of union election petitions nationally doubling from 2021 in the most recent fiscal year. In February, North Carolina saw a high-profile union election at Garner’s Amazon warehouse that spurred protest events from labor activists, though demonstrators gathered across the street from the warehouse rather than near any entrances or exits.
In an interview after the committee vote, Duke professor and labor organizer Orin Starn said he feels the bill aims to “discourage workplace demonstrations and picketing” regardless of the conduct of protesters.

A participant in the efforts to unionize the Amazon warehouse, Starn said employers already have “plenty of protections” when it comes to protests on their property. He noted that some members of the Amazon union campaign were arrested for trespassing by Garner police when they tried to collect union cards and give out food on the premises.
“This bill seems very much about weaponizing the law to keep workers from organizing,” Starn said. “Workers are already afraid of retaliation because there are minimal protections right now for workers who are trying to organize.”
Sen. Terence Everitt (D-Wake) asked whether protests at Tesla dealerships — which have drawn large crowds around the country as demonstrators have denounced CEO Elon Musk’s actions in the Trump administration — would be permitted by the bill so long as they remain peaceful and do not include threats or obstruction. Moffitt confirmed they would be.
Sen. Mujtaba Mohammed (D-Mecklenburg) proposed two amendments seeking to clarify the scope of the bill, aiming to avoid any prohibitions on federally protected labor activity. The first defines obstruction as a “sustained or deliberate physical blockage” that disrupts operations or public safety, and the second excludes from the bill any peaceful demonstrations, informational pickets, or protected labor activity — provided they do not rise to the level of violence, threats, or obstruction.
Both amendments passed, though Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) said she still held concerns that workers may be intimidated from participating in labor protests by the messaging around the bill.
“We have a lot of efforts underway to protect employee rights, and I think it’s important that they not be limited or people be intimidated from participating in those,” Grafstein said. “I believe there are some aspects of this bill that could continue to intimidate people from engaging in peaceful protests.”
The bill is will proceed to a vote before the Senate Rules Committee, where it could then be scheduled for a hearing on the Senate floor.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0607-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-29 15:08:12.243809

A lawsuit over a Des Moines Register poll that showed Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in Iowa during the final days of the 2024 campaign has been moved to federal court.
The lawsuit, one of two related to the poll, is a potential class-action case filed by the Center for American Rights on behalf of one West Des Moines man, Dennis Donnelly, against the Register, pollster J. Ann Selzer, and the newspaper’s parent company, Gannett Co. It seeks actual damages totaling $2,799,600 — the alleged cost of an annual subscription for each of the Register’s 40,000 subscribers — plus punitive damages and attorneys’ fees.
Because the lawsuit involves litigants headquartered in different states, and the total damages could exceed $5 million, the Register’s parent company, Gannett Co., sought removal of the case from state court to U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit takes issue with a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll that Selzer conducted for the Register in the final days of the 2024 presidential campaign. The poll, published the Sunday before the election, showed Harris leading Trump among likely Iowa voters 47% to 44%. Trump went on to win Iowa with 56% of the vote to Harris’ 43%.
The lawsuit alleges “a miss by 16 points is not an innocent error — it is either intentional fraud or reckless disregard for accuracy. Either way it is actionable.” It is based on the Center for American Rights’ claim that Donnelly, a Register subscriber, “was intensely frustrated by the inaccurate poll,” which was published on the Sunday before the election. It alleges Donnelly “felt like the Register was disserving him and other readers when it ran, and when its results were compared to the final outcome.”
The lawsuit seeks damages for alleged consumer fraud, professional malpractice and interference with the right to vote. The latter claim is based on the argument that “it looks like the Iowa Poll did, in fact, increase Iowa public opinion favoring Harris to win the state.”
The defendants in the case have denied any wrongdoing and the lawsuit has yet to win class-action status.
Donnelly’s lawsuit parallels one filed by Trump 
A separate lawsuit against the Register and Selzer over the same poll results was filed late last year on behalf of Trump, U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, and former state senator Brad Zaun in Polk County District Court. Like the lawsuit filed on behalf of Donnelly, Trump’s lawsuit has since been moved to federal court.
In that lawsuit, Trump and his co-plaintiffs claim the poll results in their races were intentionally skewed and that in the presidential race “Selzer was trying to generate fake enthusiasm and momentum for Harris.”
The defendants are seeking dismissal of the lawsuit, arguing the laws they are accused of violating are designed to regulate commercial businesses, not to constrain news reporting, and that polling results “do not qualify as falsified facts” merely because they don’t align with an election’s outcome.
“In our constitutional system, a claim for ‘fraudulent news’ does not exist. Full stop,” attorneys for the newspaper argue. “The remedy for disagreement with political speech one does not like is counter-speech — not court-enforced damages under the guise of commercial regulations.”
In that same case, the Center for American Rights recently asked permission to file a brief of its own in the matter, arguing that its lawsuit on behalf of Donnelly was based on largely the same issues and that the center hopes to challenge “the use and abuse of powerful and entrenched media institutions to distort our national debate.”
U.S. Magistrate Judge William P. Kelly ruled against the center two weeks ago, finding that while the center clearly had an interest in Trump’s lawsuit, the “core arguments” the center would make have already been made by the president and his fellow plaintiffs in the case.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Education Minnesota, the state’s largest union representing more than 86,000 members, elected its first Black president on Saturday.
Monica Byron ran unopposed to replace Denise Specht, who led the union since 2013. Byron started her career as a homeschool liaison for the Richfield Public Schools in 1995 before earning her teaching license. She taught elementary school in Richfield for 24 years, most recently as a math coach. In 2022, she left her teaching job when she was elected vice president of Education Minnesota.
Bryon takes over one of the state’s most influential unions at a critical juncture for public schools. More than 8 in 10 schools report having a shortage of teachers, and the union wants to increase pay to fill the ranks. But a looming budget deficit is tying the hands of state lawmakers who might otherwise support robust increases in school funding. At the federal level, the Trump administration has threatened to eliminate the Department of Education while also attacking unions.
This conversation was edited for length and clarity. 
Why did you run for president of the union?
I ran for president because I believe in the power of our union and to protect and strengthen things that matter most, like professional pay, secure pensions, affordable health care and respect for all of our educators.
You are the first Black president of Education Minnesota. What does that mean for your union and also organized labor in Minnesota?
I am really proud and honored to be the first Black president of Education Minnesota. I believe that I’m able to bring a unique and fresh perspective and voice to not only Education Minnesota but to the labor movement. I’ll be able to advocate not only for educators, but for our students and our community. And I’ll be able to ensure that all educators, but especially our educators of color, will have a voice.
The Trump administration has vowed to close the Department of Education and has threatened to withhold funding from schools with diversity programs, which was recently blocked by judges. What do you see as Education Minnesota’s role in responding to the Trump administration?
Education Minnesota has been publicly defending against the attacks on diversity, equity, inclusion and the other attacks from Washington, D.C. We are going to ensure that we have freedom to read. We’re going to make sure our history isn’t whitewashed. We’re just going to make sure that our students and our educators are able to teach and do all the things that they need to do.
What do you see as the biggest threats facing teachers and the union at this moment?
Right now, I think it’s just been the chaos and the executive orders coming. We have great partners though, from our national allies and our other labor allies. I think it’s just the unknown and the threats to the unions as a whole. But we are positioned well to be able to respond.
In 2024, just 28% of 8th graders rated proficient at reading, which is the lowest on record for the nationwide benchmark. In math, students’ abilities seem to be just as dire. I’m curious why you think teachers aren’t able to equip students with these basic skills of reading and math.
For me, the question is what resources and what other things our educators need. I believe that we need to ensure that all educators are equipped with those resources. They have the time to be able to teach and that we ensure that when it comes to class sizes, those teachers are able to reach each of those students.
Gov. Tim Walz, former teacher and union member, ran on being an education governor. Could you give him a grade on his tenure?
Education Minnesota has worked closely with Gov. Walz. President Speck is in charge when it comes to working with Gov. Walz. So as vice president, I’ve been able to watch and follow her lead. So I don’t have a grade at this time.
What are Education Minnesota’s top priorities at the Legislature this year?
Right now, our top priorities have been around professional pay, which includes a starting pay for our entry educators and $25 per hour for our ESPs. We have a pension bill, which would ensure that we have a career rule for our teachers. And we also have a bill around health insurance, so that our educators have quality health insurance. It would start a health insurance pool for our educators across the state. And we also are looking to protect the inflationary rule on education that we won last year.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250429_0024-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-29 15:08:12.243809

Currently,  Iowa code defines bullying and harassment in schools as electronic, written, verbal, or physical acts or conduct that create an objectively hostile school environment for a student based on “any actual or perceived trait or characteristic.” There are 17 traits listed as potential characteristics of a student that could be used in bullying, including age, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability and political belief. The law states that bullying is not limited to these categories.
House File 865, approved 32-16, would remove this list and reference to students being bullied because of an actual or perceived trait of a student, instead defining bullying and harassment as “repeated and targeted” acts and conduct that create a hostile school environment for a student. Sen. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, said this change is needed because some schools are not addressing bullying incidents if a student is being bullied for a reason not related to a listed trait.

“Those schools don’t believe they are required to act unless the behavior is based on one of the traits listed, those school officials believing their hands are tied,” Salmon said. “This has resulted in an unequal treatment of students and underreporting of bullying. The bill removes that confusion and clarifies that all students should receive an equal level of protection.”
But Democrats said the measure will weaken Iowa’s laws on bullying. Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said bullying is a “life of death matter” — she has known students who have died by suicide because of bullying, and Trone Garriott said it would be more difficult for families with students who are bullied to get support and responses from schools if the bill becomes law.
The law is not limited to the traits listed, Trone Garriott said, but having the 17 characteristics in law for reference helps schools and families both identify and track many of the major reasons why students are bullied, she said.
“I think the real intent might be to make it harder for folks on this list to get the support they need, and for the people of Iowa to know what’s happening in our schools,” Trone Garriott said. “This bill makes it harder. This bill removes guidance. This bill is not going to protect anyone. It’s going to make our students more vulnerable.”
Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, said he was bullied in school, and suffered severe depression during middle school and high school because of the bullying he faced. He said the bill will make it harder for students like him to seek help from schools, saying the definition of bullying as “repeated and targeted” acts and conduct will not cover much of the harassment students face.
“The instance of my life when I was the lowest, where I went home from school and cried for the entire day and the entire afternoon, is because some child, student, that had never bullied me before said one mean word to me, and that’s what set me off that day,” Blake said. “You never know what that behavior will be that sets a child off, and taking these restrictions and making it harder to protect our children is not something we should be doing in this body.”
Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, the former president of the Central DeWitt School Board, called for lawmakers to look at how their local school districts address bullying. He said Iowa school districts already have board policies created to define and address bullying, which includes the ability to report bullying and harassment incidents using an online form.
“The vehicle to address bullying and harassment is already in code, it is already in board policy,” Zimmer said. “It is in every single school district in this state. If an administrator is misinterpreting this, this is not going to solve that. That’s an issue that’s got to be handled internally between the superintendent their subordinates.”
He said a better approach, if there is a problem with school officials not addressing bullying if it does not involve harassment based on limited traits, would be doing more to inform parents about the existing policy and platform.
Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, said that while Zimmer’s point was correct — a board policy and procedure on how to report bullying exists — he said there are some school districts misinterpreting the law so that if a bullied student does not have an identity or characteristic listed in the Iowa code, “they’re passing it off as just two kids that were having a disagreement or a misunderstanding or a skirmish.”
“Every child should be protected in schools, every child, not just because they match up some certain traits that we decided to laundry list a number of years ago in Iowa code,” Evans said. “The bill that is before us cleans up Iowa code. It makes it very clear that it should apply to the majority of school board policies already on the books, but it ensures that every kid — even though their traits may not be listed in Iowa code — that they get the same protections as everyone else.”
The measure heads to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk.

(Photo by Ty Wright/Getty Images)Former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis plans to ask the United States Supreme Court to weigh in on whether she was protected by the First Amendment when refusing same-sex marriage licenses a decade ago, her lawyer announced Monday. 
This comes after the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused a request to re-hear her case, saying the panel of judges who ruled against Davis in March already considered the case fully. 
Mat Staver, the founder and chairman of conservative legal group Liberty Counsel, said in a statement that the nation’s highest court is “the next step to give Kim Davis justice in this case since the emotional distress damage award against her in her individual capacity is barred by the First Amendment.” 
Davis is fighting a federal jury’s decision that she should pay $100,000 to a couple she denied a marriage license in 2015. But her lawyers also want the case to result in same-sex marriage rights being revoked. 
“This case underscores why the U.S. Supreme Court should overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, because that decision threatens the religious liberty of many Americans who believe that marriage is a sacred institution between one man and one woman,” Staver said. “The First Amendment precludes making the choice between your faith and your livelihood.”
The move is expected. Staver, who argued on Davis’ behalf in Cincinnati in January before a 3-judge panel in the 6th Circuit, said at that time he intended to use her case to try and overturn marriage equality. 
Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that guaranteed same-sex couples marriage rights, is “on the same shifting sand” that doomed Roe v. Wade, Staver said.   
“I think … it’s not a matter of ‘if,’ it’s a matter of ‘when’ Obergefell will be overturned,” Staver told the Lantern in January. “I have no doubt that Obergefell will be overturned, and the issue will be returned back to the states as it was before 2015.” 
The Kim Davis case 
Davis, then the Rowan County clerk, made national headlines in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to several same-sex couples based on her religious beliefs. 
In 2015, U.S. District Judge David Bunning ordered Davis to jail for five days for contempt for refusing to comply with a court order. 
In 2024, Bunning ordered Davis to pay $260,104 in fees and expenses to attorneys who represented one of the couples she refused a marriage license. Bunning earlier ordered Davis to pay the couple, David Ermold and David Moore, $100,000 in damages for violating their constitutional rights. Liberty Counsel has unsuccessfully fought Bunning’s decisions. 
Davis lost her bid for reelection as Rowan County clerk in 2018.
Her lawyers have argued she acted within her First Amendment rights when she refused to issue the licenses, though judges don’t agree. 
In March, the 6th Circuit refused to strike down the jury judgement against her on those grounds, saying she “cannot raise a Free Exercise Clause defense because she is being held liable for state action, which the First Amendment does not protect.” 
Liberty Counsel said the case raises the question “of whether a government official sued in an individual capacity and stripped of governmental immunity may assert a personal First Amendment defense to monetary damages.”
The group wants the Supreme Court to take up the case to “answer the question of ‘first impression,’ resolve any conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, and ensure that former government defendants standing before the Court in their personal capacity do not lose First Amendment protections.”

The byproduct was high in ammonia and very corrosive, according to DNR staff who responded to the incident and observed murky, brown water conditions flowing all the way into the Des Moines River. 
The majority of dead fish, 62,620, were observed in South Branch Lizard Creek, where the spill from CJ Bio America occurred. The company noticed the byproduct from manufacturing lysine had leaked into a stormwater drain, which staff blocked with a berm that they later realized had developed a breach. According to DNR, this allowed an unknown amount of the byproduct to flow to the surface intake of a neighboring field and into the creek. 
DNR valued the fish killed from the incident at $73,819. Most of the dead fish were small minnows, shiners, dace and chub, but other varieties included nearly 5,000 suckers, more than 2,000 rock and smallmouth bass and 37 northern pike. 
CJ Bio America did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the issue. 
DNR investigating wastewater spills in Boyer and South Skunk Rivers
DNR is investigating two recent wastewater spills, one from a meat processing facility near Denison into Boyer River and another from a wastewater treatment plant into the South Skunk River. 
A valve malfunction at Smithfield Fresh Meats Corp. in Denison led to an estimated 500-gallon spill of wastewater into the Boyer River. DNR staff were notified Sunday morning of the release, which was quickly stopped by Smithfield staff who closed the stormwater drain where the water was flowing. 
John Baker, environmental specialist with the DNR field office in Atlantic, said most of the wastewater was contained to the stormwater system, which is being cleaned. 
Baker said no dead fish have been observed in the Boyer River. 
In Story City, an estimated 1.5 million gallons of partially treated wastewater was released into South Skunk River over the weekend due to unusually high flows to a wastewater treatment plant. 
According to a press release from DNR, the wastewater was treated using an ultraviolet disinfection process before it was diverted into the river. High flows at the plant were caused by heavy rain over the past week. 
The plant began discharging the water around 2 p.m. on Saturday and ended Sunday around 4 p.m. 
No dead fish have been observed in the river as a result of the event.

It was a unanimous opinion but one judge dissented on the reasoning. 
“This court finds there was no election irregularity and the election results are valid,” Chief Justice Mary Russell wrote in the opinion.
Business groups have been fighting on two fronts to gut the law since it passed in November. Tuesday’s decision marks the failure of one front, but efforts to convince Republican lawmakers to overturn the law remain in play. 
A bill that cleared the House and awaits action in the Senate would repeal the sick leave provisions. Negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans on that legislation appear to have stalled. 
“In light of today’s decision, it is now imperative that the Missouri General Assembly pass HB 567,” Kara Corches, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said in a press release, referring to the bill to gut paid sick leave.
The Missouri Supreme Court heard arguments last month seeking to strike down the law, filed by a coalition of business groups and individuals. The lawsuit argued the law should be thrown out for violating constitutional rules on ballot initiatives, including violations of the state constitution’s single-subject requirement and a lack of a clear title, which the court ruled it lacks jurisdiction over. 
Prop A passed with nearly 58% of the vote and had the support of numerous unions, workers’ advocacy groups, social justice and civil rights organizations, as well as over 500 business owners.
Senate Democrats have spent two nights this month blocking Republican efforts to overturn the law. They have worked on reaching a compromise regarding implementation details.
Lawmakers and business groups push rollback of Missouri minimum wage hike, sick leave law

Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, has been an especially loud voice urging full repeal. She has said that even though requirements go into effect May 1, the Senate could continue working to weaken the law until the end of session on May 16.
The bill sponsored by state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a Republican from Jefferson City, and state Rep. Sherri Gallick, a Republican from Belton, would overturn the law requiring most employers to provide paid sick time off for hundreds of thousands of qualifying workers. It would also modify the minimum wage law by removing the requirement that it be indexed to inflation.
State Sen. Brian Williams, a Democrat from University City, spent over two hours blocking action in the chamber with a filibuster Tuesday morning, saying some had been acting in bad faith during negotiations.
“This year, there’s been again, people going back on negotiation, bad faith efforts, distrust, people feeling deceived and members of the body feeling disrespected,” he said. “But most importantly, all in the name of disregarding voters. The very same voters that have sent us here.” 
Under the law, beginning May 1 employers with business receipts greater than $500,000 a year must provide at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours. The law also gradually increases the minimum wage.
“It is financially burdensome, just short of devastating, and its regulatory requirements are extremely difficult for single unit operators,” Buddy Lahl, CEO of the Missouri Restaurant Association, told The Independent Tuesday.
The bill would allow the minimum wage to increase to $15 per hour in 2026, as voters approved, but it would not be adjusted for inflation thereafter — a policy that has been in place since 2007. The sick leave provisions would be repealed entirely.
Prop A would make sick leave guaranteed for around 728,000 workers who currently lack it statewide, or over 1 in 3 Missouri workers, according to an analysis from the progressive nonprofit the Missouri Budget Project.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico lawmakers this week rolled out a plan to help prepare for potential hefty reductions in federal funding.
The Legislative Council, the group of state representatives and senators that oversees all lawmaking between New Mexico’s legislative sessions, voted unanimously Monday afternoon at its first meeting following this year’s session to create a new panel called the Federal Infrastructure Funds and Stability Interim Committee. 
House Speaker Javier Martínez and Senate President Pro Tem Mimi Stewart, both Albuquerque Democrats, told Source NM after the meeting that the committee, in a nutshell, will examine potential federal funding cuts and consider ways to adapt to them if they become real.
For example, the committee will look at proposals to cut funding to Head Start, a child care and early education program. This week, U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) joined 40 other senators in a letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. demanding he immediately unfreeze Head Start funding and reinstate early childhood education workers who have either been laid off or furloughed as result of closures of the preschools, which rely on federal funding.
Similarly, the new legislative committee will track funds for Medicaid, the safety-net health insurance program for people with low incomes, Martínez said. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said previously she might call a special session in the fall, should the state need to address federal shortcomings in programs such as Medicaid. The state also is also party to multi-state lawsuits challenging federal cuts.
Its members will also consider the Trump administration’s proposal to abolish the federal Department of Education, Stewart said. Federal funding accounts for 30% of New Mexico’s education budget, she said, including money for special education.
Stewart said the committee has no historical precedent in the New Mexico Legislature, noting “this is an ahistorical presidency.” The committee is intended to last for the remainder of the year, but could extend beyond that if needed, she said.

Martínez told the Legislative Council the new committee will not duplicate the work being done by the Legislative Finance Committee and other legislative panels but, rather, supplement it with a “proactive approach to deal with any potential reductions in federal funding.”
“It will be what I consider to be a very nuts-and-bolts committee, with a tailored, specific focus,” he said.
Martínez appointed Rep. Patricia Lundstrom (D-Grants) as the panel’s co-chair from the House of Representatives, and Stewart appointed Sen. William Soules (D-Las Cruces) as the co-chair from the Senate. Attempts to reach Lundstrom and Soules for comment through spokespeople for their respective chambers were unsuccessful as of publication time.
Other members of the new committee include Reps. Susan Herrera (D-Embudo), Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Las Cruces), Mark Duncan (R-Kirtland) and Cathrynn Brown (R-Carlsbad); and Sens. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe), James Townsend (R-Artesia) and Minority Whip Pat Woods (R-Broadview).
The panel is expected to hold an organizational meeting in May, Martínez said.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state House on Tuesday sent a bill that would limit most public schools to two virtual days a year to the governor’s desk despite bipartisan opposition.
Beginning in the 2026-27 school year, Senate Bill 758 limits brick-and-mortar schools to 12 hours of virtual instruction as long as the state superintendent approves an online instruction plan or if there’s a governor-issued state of emergency affecting the district.
State Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, the bill’s author, said nothing in the measure eliminates the option for a four-day school week. More than two virtual days just couldn’t count toward instruction time. Moore said his bill ensures that districts not specifically approved for a four-day school week are not taking every Friday off by scheduling a virtual day, resulting in 37 fewer days of instruction.
“I think that I’m with you on this idea that we don’t want to be losing class time, but I’m not sure why virtual days are equating to not having instruction,” said Rep. Michelle McCane, D-Tulsa, a former educator. “Is that how it’s being applied? Because every virtual day I’ve ever been involved in really still required a lot of instruction and support on my part as a teacher.”
Moore said it should work that way, but it isn’t in a lot of districts. Schools are sending packets home with no teacher available online. His children had two virtual days last year where they had no instructional material. He said there are also young children that might not have parents at home who are able to help them complete their assignments.
“Who’s going to help that kid?” he asked. 
He said he’s received hundreds of emails about the bill.
Moore said the state wants to improve its poor academic ranking, and more face-to-face instruction will help.  
McCane said virtual school days should have structure and not be a packet sent home. But she said virtual school days should be an option in the event of bad weather or excessive teacher absences. Districts would lose the flexibility to utilize that option moving forward.
Rep. Cynthia Roe, R-Lindsay, said her grandson had a virtual day two weeks ago and completed his work in 45 minutes. This bill fixes that issue.
The measure passed the state House by a 53-32 vote.

Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, shared disappointment with President Donald Trump's policy agenda during the first 100 days of the Republican president's second term. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of House's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids marked the 100th day of President Donald Trump’s second term by rattling off objections to handling of tariffs, threats to Medicaid and Social Security, and presidential adviser Elon Musk’s conflicts of interest.
Davids, a Democrat who serves the 3rd District in the Kansas City area, has stood out in her evaluation of Trump given Kansas’ three other representatives and two senators — all Republicans — endorsed Trump’s candidacy and remain supportive of the president.
“Kansas families deserve so much more than chaotic policies that raise their costs and weaken their freedoms,” Davids said Tuesday.
Davids said Trump’s tariff war could raise household costs by $3,800 per year and harm export markets for Kansas farmers and manufacturers. In response to imposition of tariffs, trade partners of the United States imposed retaliatory barriers to commerce. For example, Trump’s import duties on Chinese products were set at 145%. U.S. exports entering China face a 125% tariff.
Davids objected to federal legislation that could jeopardize Medicaid coverage and retirement security for thousands of her constituents in Kansas. She said she opposed “destabilizing” job cuts at the Social Security Administration and other federal agencies.
In addition to advocating for due process for Americans and judicial independence in the court system, Davids supported a bill to increase transparency of Musk’s work with DOGE or the Department of Government Efficiency. A U.S. Senate report indicated Musk’s role in the Trump administration could shield his companies from more than $2.3 billion in potential legal liability.
“I’ll always stand up for our community, whether that’s protecting Social Security, making child care more affordable or lowering prices at the grocery store,” Davids said.
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican representing the 4th District surrounding Wichita, said the U.S. House’s passage of a federal budget framework before a two-week recess was a “major win for Kansans and President Trump’s American First agenda.”
Republican majorities in the House and Senate have been working on a legislative bundle that would extend tax cuts adopted in 2017 during Trump’s first term and authorize federal spending reductions that critics contend would have an impact on Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security.
“By voting ‘yes,’ we’re voting for a path to make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent,” Estes said. “A ‘yes’ vote prevents the largest tax increase for Americans in history.”
GOP U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, who serves the 1st District of western and central Kansas, also voted for House Concurrent Resolution 14 that set revenue and spending targets for fiscal years 2026 through 2036.
“I was proud to advance this legislation and set the foundation for Congress to implement President Trump’s agenda,” Mann said. “I look forward to working with my committees in the coming weeks to identify even more savings for the American taxpayer and deliver the one big, beautiful bill Americans have asked for.”
The budget resolution passed the House 216-214 with backing from Estes, Mann and U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt of the 2nd District. Davids voted against it. In the U.S. Senate, the budget framework passed 51-48 with support from Sen. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall, both Kansas Republicans.
Mann said the resolution directed Congress to find savings for taxpayers, invest in border security and national defense, promote domestic energy production and prevent expiration of the 2017  tax cuts.
“Seventy-seven million Americans, including myself, gave Washington, D.C., a mandate to secure the border, lower taxes and get our country back on track,” he said. “These are the common sense policy solutions that the Big First District overwhelmingly voted for last November.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sharice-Davids-on-house-floor-1024x508.png,,,2025-04-29 14:11:38.484534

The sole no vote was Republican state Sen. Mike Moon of Ash Grove. 
The bill garnered little opposition when it cleared the House last week 129 to 14, though a group of Republican lawmakers condemned the provision making it illegal for anyone under 18 years old to marry. 
“There are legitimate reasons for people 16, 17 to become married,” said state Rep. Dean van Schoiack, a Savannah Republican, who was also vocal in his opposition to the idea last year. “A pregnancy could be a legitimate reason to become married, for one thing.” 
He said he knows many couples who were married at 16 or 17 who are still together.
State Rep. Hardy Billington, a Poplar Bluff Republican, said “more babies will die” if the bill passes. 
“People at 16, 17 years old will have more abortions because they can’t get married,” he said.
Both Billington and Van Schoiack left the House chamber during a roll call on the legislation, and thus did not record a vote.
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said the Platte County recorder of deeds shared with her “how horrifying his experience is when he has to assist a young woman with a marriage certificate, the look in her eyes when he knows that this is against her will.” 
She then turned her comments to Van Schoiack.
“And for you to stand up here and advocate for young women to be married off, it is disgusting,” Aune said. “Honestly, I can’t believe it. It’s indefensible. I can’t believe you would stand up in a microphone and say it out loud.” 
Under current Missouri law, anyone under 16 is prohibited from getting married. But 16 and 17 year olds can get married with parental consent to anyone under 21. 
Marriage would be banned for anyone under 18 under the bill that passed Tuesday. 
There was no discussion before Tuesday’s vote, but in 2023 Moon’s opposition to the child marriage ban garnered national attention when he said: “Do you know any kids who have been married at age 12? I do. And guess what? They’re still married.”
The ban on child marriage almost passed last year but was stalled by a small group of Republican critics.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The underlying bill, dealing with foster children, was sponsored by Republican state Rep. Melissa Schmidt of Eldridge, and handled by Republican Sen. Jamie Burger. Most of the provisions were added on by other members as amendments.
Among its many provisions is a ban on Missouri’s social services agency from seizing Social Security benefits from foster kids. 
Missouri’s child welfare agency takes millions of dollars each year in foster children’s benefits and uses the money to help pay for foster care. In fiscal year 2024, the Children’s Division spent over $10.6 million in children’s benefits. Over 1,200 foster kids were receiving benefits in Missouri of late last year, or just over 10% of all kids in care.
As a result, kids who are orphaned or have disabilities are responsible for paying toward the cost of their care in state custody. 
The bill would ban the state from using those benefits to pay itself back for routine foster care expenses. Instead, the division could use the funds for the child’s “unmet needs” beyond what the division is obligated to pay, such as housing as the child prepares to age out of foster care.
The effort to ban the practice won bipartisan support during last year’s session and was on the precipice of passing. But it died when GOP infighting forced the state Senate to adjourn early. 
House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, pledged earlier this year that this legislation would be the first bill sent to the Senate, highlighting the issue as legislation that “should have been passed but fell victim to our inaction and politics.”
The bill also voids nondisclosure agreements in childhood sexual abuse cases. 
And it includes a proposal by Republican state Sen. Travis Fitzwater of Holts Summit that would assign foster children 14 to client-directed attorneys, meaning they would be required to act based on the goals of the children. Currently, foster children have guardians ad litem, who are attorneys tasked with acting in what they view as the child’s best interest. 
The shift, which would be subject to appropriation, goes into effect in 2028 unless a county opts into a pilot program.The judge in each case would still have the discretion to continue the guardian ad litem appointment. The bill also creates a commission appointed by the chief justice of the state Supreme Court to review family legal representation throughout the state, and make recommendations to bolster its uniformity and quality.
It would also require the state Department of Social Services to build a program of residential care for youth with severe behavioral challenges currently being held in inappropriate placements, by contracting with qualified service providers. This, too, would likely require funding by the legislature. 
Other provisions include:

Increasing a tax credit for donations to certain youth programs.
Clarifying that parents allowing children to engage in appropriate independent activities without supervision would not be considered abuse or neglect.
Stating that the state Children’s Division cannot hold itself harmless in contracts with private service providers when there are issues resulting from the state’s negligence.
Requiring Children’s Division caseworkers to present identification of themselves when conducting investigations of child abuse and neglect, and inform parents of their rights;
Requiring the Children’s Division to take into consideration the religion of the foster child when determining placement, in order to ensure children are in households of a similar religion to their families’ when practicable.
Modifying the Amber Alert system to add that the system will aid in finding not only an abducted child but an “abducted or missing African American youth.”

They found more detainees, and health care gaps",Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/04/ice-detention-center-investigation/,A California law empowers state investigators to check on conditions at ICE detention centers. A new report raises concerns about health care inside them.,"In summary
A California law empowers state investigators to check on conditions at ICE detention centers. A new report raises concerns about health care inside them.


A new report from the California Department of Justice finds that immigration detention facilities across the state continue to fall short in providing basic mental health care, with gaps in suicide prevention and treatment, recordkeeping, and use of force incidents against mentally ill detainees. 
The report’s release today comes alongside an aggressive expansion of immigration enforcement and broader changes to immigration policy under President Donald Trump’s second administration. The timing of the report’s release signals California officials plan to continue oversight as federal officials move to expand immigration detention capacity in the state.
It flagged that California’s detainee population has grown since the state’s last review: more than 3,100 people were held in immigration detention statewide as of April 16, up from the daily average of about 1,750 in 2021, the report found. About 75% of those detained had no documented criminal history.     
Investigators with the state’s Department of Justice inspected all six active immigration facilities in California. The inspections were conducted under a 2017 state law that mandated the Attorney General’s office review and report on immigration detention facilities operating in California. It’s the fourth report to be released on conditions in facilities where noncitizens are detained in California by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities. 
The findings come amid broader concerns about federal oversight: the report notes that the federal Department of Homeland Security recently moved to shutter internal offices tasked with investigating civil rights complaints and detention conditions. Last week, the homeland security department quietly removed more than 100 civil rights and civil liberties records from its website, sparking concerns about transparency and accountability in immigration enforcement. 
“California’s facility reviews remain especially critical in light of efforts by the Trump Administration to both eliminate oversight of conditions at immigration detention facilities and increase its inhumane campaign of mass immigration enforcement, potentially exacerbating critical issues already present in these facilities by packing them with more people,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta. 
The 165-page report details conditions at privately operated facilities where federal immigration officials detain people facing deportation. State investigators found “deficiencies in suicide prevention and intervention strategies” at every site, including missed mental health screenings and improper clinical decisions about when to release detainees from suicide watch. 
Staffing shortages, poor coordination between medical and mental health care providers, and widespread problems with record-keeping contributed to the risks for detainees, many of whom suffer from depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the report. 
Conditions that can worsen mental health, such as solitary confinement, remain common, the report found. At facilities known as Desert View Annex, Imperial, and Otay Mesa, investigators found that force was disproportionately used against individuals with mental health conditions, including cases where chemical agents were deployed. At the Mesa Verde facility in Bakersfield, officials failed to properly document or report the forced transfer of detainees who had participated in a peaceful hunger strike, the report said. 
Despite federal guidelines discouraging the isolation of detainees with mental illness, the California review found people with serious mental health conditions were routinely placed in segregation, sometimes for months at a time. Investigators found some facilities failed to properly inform detainees about protections under a federal court settlement that requires legal representation for people with severe mental health disorders. 
Pat-down policies at the Mesa Verde center discouraged detainees from seeking health care, the review found. Detainees reported feeling that invasive searches deterred them from attending medical appointments or accessing other services. 
A spokesman for Geo Group, the private company that operates several of the facilities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the just-released report, but previously told CalMatters that the company provides high-quality medical services including “around-the-clock access to medical care, which is governed by the Performance-Based National Detention Standards set by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and independently accredited by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care.” 
“In all instances, our contracted services are monitored by the federal government to ensure strict compliance with Performance-Based National Detention Standards, which apply to all ICE Processing Centers,” Geo spokesman Christopher Ferreira said in December. 
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Screenshot via Attorney General's X livestream)Attorney General James Uthmeier said his office is “putting our money where our mouth is” in announcing a state-funded legal team dedicated to enforcing parents-rights laws.
Addressing a crowd of fourth graders at Jacksonville Classical Academy Tuesday, Uthmeier said his office is “making sure that we’re walking the walk and setting examples” in enforcing laws related to gender transition, library materials, school surveys, and other topics that have dominated legislative, judicial, and executive conversations in recent years. 
Uthmeier announced the creation of the Office of Parental Rights, a “team of litigators focused on fighting the fights that parents bring to us.”
“It’s frustrating that we do have to go so far as to enshrine in law a lot of these rights that are indeed God-given,” Uthmeier said. “But at the end of the day, government is weak. Government cannot be trusted, and we want to protect parents everywhere we can.”
Uthmeier was flanked by Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice, Patti Sullivan from Parental Rights Florida, Kim Hermann from Southeastern Legal Foundation, and January Littlejohn, a Leon County parent who claims a school aided her child’s gender transition, although the school has prevailed in court proceedings so far.
Uthmeier said his office will coordinate with the Department of Education to address complaints to be handled by the Office of Parental Rights. 
“I understand you guys probably don’t fully appreciate the importance of the announcement here today, but you will grow up fast,” Uthmeier said, addressing the fourth-graders. “You will have your own kids, your own families. It will happen much faster than you think. And I assure you, you will appreciate what’s being done here today.”

Uthmeier said Florida has been a “shining city on a hill, an example for the rest of the country to look to when it comes to enshrining parental rights.”
Lawmakers have focused heavily on enabling parents to remove books from school libraries they may consider to be “pornographic,” require parental consent to take surveys related to mental health concerns and sexual behavior, and parental notifications relating to a student’s education. 
Litigation for some of the laws has become costly. For example, in Escambia County, as of December, the school district had spent more than $640,000 to defend book-removal policies, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. 
“We’re certainly not looking to run up costs, but when it comes to fighting the right fights, I’ll spend every dollar we have,” Uthmeier said. 
Last week, a bill (HB 1505) to require parental consent for any survey offered to a child, including about mental health, politics, and sexual health, passed the House on a party-line vote. It would expand the state’s “Parental Bill of Rights” and includes mandatory parental consent for STI treatment.
Similar legislation is awaiting debate on the Senate floor.
Uthmeier has been in office less that three months. He was appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year, filling the vacancy created by former AG Ashley Moody’s appointment by DeSantis to the U.S. Senate.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 17:43:05+00:00,CT Mirror,AG says Lamont didn’t break law handling ARPA interest,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/ned-lamont-arpa-interest-ruling/,But a GOP leader said Lamont's administration still was wrong for not reporting these interest dollars to legislators for nearly three years.,"Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration didn’t violate state law when it moved $340 million in interest earned on federal COVID relief grants into the state budget, Attorney General William Tong said Monday.
But while Tong settled the legal question, a Republican leader said the Democratic governor’s administration still was wrong for not reporting these interest dollars to legislators for nearly three years.
Though Connecticut received roughly $2.8 billion from Congress in March 2021 through the American Rescue Plan Act, Lamont’s administration didn’t shift investment earnings on that pandemic relief from an off-budget account into the General Fund until Jan. 8 of this year — roughly one month before the governor would propose spending most of that interest to expand child care services. (Most state programs and services and financed through the General Fund or other accounts within the formal state budget.)
Frustrated by that late disclosure and timing, House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, asked whether Lamont could move the funds into the budget without legislative approval.
Tong wrote that existing law stipulates all interest on investments must go into the General Fund, unless the legislature directs otherwise. And no special instructions were issued when Connecticut received the ARPA funds, which it’s used to bolster education, human services, municipal aid and other programs for the past four years.
The attorney general also noted the legislature is aware of its legal options. “The General Assembly knows how to override the default rule when it wants and has done so on several occasions,” he wrote.
And while the legislature set many special rules for Lamont to follow on spending ARPA dollars, the Tong noted they apply only to “federal funds designated for the state” and not on the interest those grants may generate.
“This opinion from Attorney General Tong confirms that our reporting of the interest income is consistent with statutory requirements,” the governor’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Monday.
“I never doubted in my mind that the Democrat attorney general would have a ruling favorable to the Democrat governor,” Candelora said Monday, adding it still doesn’t explain how hundreds of millions of dollars was not reported for years to the legislature “but magically appeared in the dark of night” shortly before Lamont would propose a use for it. “Fundamentally, I think that’s wrong for good government, and I think it’s wrong for transparency.”
When The Connecticut Mirror first reported that the interest dollars had appeared on a Jan. 15, 2025, revenue projections document that Lamont’s budget office and nonpartisan legislative analysts sent to the General Assembly, legislators from both parties expressed concerns about the timing.
Collibee said in January that the administration had asked the treasurer’s office in the spring of 2021, shortly after the ARPA funding had been received, to assign all interest earnings to the General Fund. But, he added, “There appeared to have been some miscommunication.”
And Jeffrey Beckham, Lamont’s budget director since early 2022, said in mid-January that his office wasn’t aware for years that tens of millions of dollars in ARPA-related interest due annually to the General Fund wasn’t being transferred.
“It became apparent to us in the last couple of months,” he added at the time.
State Treasurer Erick Russell, who succeeded fellow Democrat Shawn Wooden as treasurer in January 2023, has not speculated on communication between his predecessor and the Lamont administration.
But Russell noted in mid-January that the treasurer’s office provides four reports yearly to Beckham on how ARPA investments are performing. 
In other words, the Lamont administration had plenty of reminders each year that tens of millions of dollars in interest in ARPA investments were pouring in annually.
The Lamont administration co-writes revenue reports filed three times annually with the General Assembly that reported other interest earnings — but not the return on ARPA investments until this year.
Candelora added that Connecticut Democrats who are worried about President Donald Trump’s efforts to cut spending without congressional approval should be more concerned about Lamont’s handling of the ARPA interest.
“This very behavior,” Candelora said, “reeks of the things they accuse the president of doing.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lamont-and-Tong-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-29 14:11:38.484534

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Late in an acrimonious legislative session certain to run into overtime, House Speaker Daniel Perez on Tuesday announced an intensive study of property taxes with an eye toward taking reforms before the voters next year.
Perez announced he was creating a Select Committee on Property Taxes that would craft a proposed constitutional amendment that could be passed by lawmakers at the start of next year’s session in January, then go to the ballot in November 2026. 
Perez included in his remarks a shot at Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has pushed for the elimination of property taxes, for not coming up with his own detailed proposal.
“Several months ago, Gov. DeSantis introduced the exciting and provocative idea of abolishing property taxes in Florida. Naturally, many of us had the same questions. How would elimination of property taxes work? If property taxes go away, how would local governments pay for the services? We expect local government to provide by police, fire, and infrastructure,” Perez said.
 “Unfortunately, as the weeks have gone by, the governor has yet to come forward with any specific answers to those questions or with any specific plan or with actual bill language.”
Perez did stress, though, that the House would consider any proposal from the governor.
“If the governor comes forward with a proposal, we will hear it. All ideas are welcome. All voices are invited to be heard. This process is not about ego or pride of authorship or credit. This is about bringing the very best proposals before the people of Florida so that they have an opportunity to decide their own fate,” Perez said.

The speaker took another shot at the governor and the Senate for their proposed fiscal year 2025-26 spending plans, which run higher than the budget passed by the House.
“I am not oblivious to the impact that property tax reform would have on local governments, but we, as a House, have a unique credibility on this front, as we proposed to doing something neither the governor nor the Senate were willing to do, apply the same revenue restrictions to ourselves that we are asking local governments to endure.”

The speaker tapped Reps. Toby Overdorf and Vicky Lopez as chair and vice chair of the panel, respectively. Perez encouraged members who want to serve on the panel to come forward.
“However, please remember that this select committee will be meeting throughout the rest of spring, summer, and into the fall. So if you are interested, be prepared to work,” he said.
Five potential reforms
Perez wants the select committee to begin its work by “exploring a variety of potential reforms,” including:

Requiring every city, county, and special district to hold a referendum on the question of eliminating property taxes on homestead properties.
Creating a new $500,000 homestead exemption, as well as a $1 million homestead exemption for properties owned by Floridians aged 65 and older, or who have had a homestead for 30 years, applicable to all non-school taxes.
Authorizing the Legislature to increase the homestead exemption to any value by general law rather than constitutional amendment.
Modifying the assessment increase limitations on property values: For homestead properties, changing the cap from the lower of 3% or consumer price index to a flat 3% over any three-year period for all taxes. For non-homestead properties, changing the cap from 10% annually to 15% over any three-year period for all non-school taxes.
Protecting homeownership by eliminating the ability to foreclose on a homestead property due to a property tax lien.

Perez will announce the committee appointments Wednesday and the panel will meet this week. Usually, the last week of session (set to end Friday) is reserved for budget conferee meetings at which members of the House and Senate meet to hammer out the spending differences between the chambers.
The impasse over tax relief, though, has prevented that from occurring.
 Tax impasse

DeSantis has pushed for the elimination of property taxes while Perez has championed rolling back the state’s sales tax by 0.75%, to 5.25%. The speaker’s plan also would roll back all other sales tax rates by the same amount — commercial rent from 2% to 1.25%; electricity from 4.35% to 3.6%; new mobile home purchases from 3% to 2.25%; and coin-operated amusement machines from 4% to 3.25%.
Senate President Ben Albritton supports tax relief but earlier this session floated a more modest$2.1 billion  plan  centered around a permanent elimination of the sales tax on clothing and shoes costing $75 or less. Other parts of his plan include a permanent reduction in the business rent tax from 2% to 1%, a one-time credit for vehicle registration fees, and several sales tax holidays.
The difference between the House and Senate proposals for fiscal year 2025-26 is $4.4 billion. The Senate made seven spending and tax relief offers to the House as of Monday but none were accepted.
“Given the importance of this issue, you cannot afford further delay in moving this conversation beyond promises or generalities. We need to put in the time in order to give stakeholders meaningful opportunities and make sure that we put the very best proposal or proposals on the ballot as amendments to the Florida Constitution,” Perez said.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)
Mississippi nonprofit centers that serve survivors of domestic violence, dating violence and sexual assault have been unable to apply for crucial federal grants, creating uncertainty and potentially jeopardizing services and staffing.   
The U.S. Department of Justice awards tens of millions of dollars yearly through the Violence Against Women Act, but in February, grant information was taken down from the Office on Violence Against Women’s website right before the usual application deadline.
As of the end of April, the information hasn’t returned, and the office’s website announcing funding opportunities was last updated Feb. 6, telling applicants not to finalize any applications.
“So many times when you’re utilizing federal funds to pretty much run your organization, when those federal funds are cut, you have to start looking at cutting staff and services,” said Joy Jones, executive director of the Mississippi Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which receives VAWA funding. 
“That is detrimental to victims of crime,” she added. 
Since 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded nearly $50 million to Mississippi nonprofit centers, the State Department of Health and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. That’s money that has supported the operation of shelters, transitional housing, victim advocacy, education and more. 
Other funding through VAWA includes training for law enforcement officers and prosecutors as well as support for rural communities and college campuses. 
Meridian’s Care Lodge serves nine counties in the east central part of the state. Its executive director, Kim Neal, said federal grants support the organization’s emergency shelter, where over 200 women, men and children turned to last year. 
She said a lot of the funding is to ensure people have basic needs like clothing, food and a safe environment, in addition to advocacy, like when survivors want to file charges or to seek a protective order. 
Tupelo-based S.A.F.E., Inc. serves nine counties in northeast Mississippi. A rural grant has allowed the organization to do work at its domestic violence shelter and in the community, including throughout April – Sexual Assault Awareness Month. 
Through federal and state grants, S.A.F.E, housed 55 people last year, including those who are homeless as a result of domestic violence and sexual assault, said Zowee Shanks, S.A.F.E’s executive director. 
“When people are making these decisions to pull the grants out, they are not understanding these shelters do more work than at our 19-bed facility,” she said. 
Another federal funding source for domestic violence and rape crisis centers is through the Victims of Crime Act. That act created the Crime Victims Fund, which collects fines and penalties from people convicted of federal crimes and distributes the money to states. 
In October, the start of the federal government’s fiscal year, the crime fund is expected to be cut by $700 million, meaning less funding for states and victim service programs.
The Mississippi Department of Health uses VAWA and VOCA grants along with $12 million from the State Legislature to support victim services that many shelters provide, said Gregory Flynn, a spokesperson for the department. 
Currently, the Health Department funds support ten of the 11 domestic violence shelters across the state, including Care Lodge and S.A.F.E, Inc. 
At the same time as VAWA grants were frozen, the Justice Department cancelled funding for 365 grant programs for nonprofit organizations across the country working with crime victims. Some of the grant recipients were notified that their projects no longer “effectuate” the DOJ’s agencies, CBS News reported. 
“It certainly concerns us,” Neal said about the wait for answers about the federal grants.

I have a developmental disability, ADHD, but no one would ever know unless I share that information. My invisibility makes disability skeptics and critics shockingly open about their bigotry.
A former boss genuinely thought the whole point of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was to ensure people in wheelchairs could apply for jobs, not provide individual workplace accommodations. Long before the current administration was in office, the owner of a salon told me she’d never hire anyone with a disability because she thought accommodations were a scam to increase her small business expenses.
Lest you think the current harsh commentary of people with disabilities lies only on one side of the aisle, even my progressive family members are quietly ideologically aligned with today’s attacks on the disability community.
So when I read headlines about how the disability community is to blame for a plane crash or how some of us “should just die,” I’m not surprised.  Instead, I look at what is causing such unfounded panic.
First, there are over 40 million of us with disabilities, and a bulk of them are over the age of 75.  That’s a lot of people to accommodate in individualized ways, so perhaps such a task is too daunting, but we’re not asking for the impossible.
Second, there is a real fear that individualized accommodations could lead to an unfair advantage.  What those complaints fail to acknowledge is that people with disabilities already begin with a significant disadvantage by merely having a disability. The world we live in was designed for neurotypical, able-bodied people and no one else.
Third, the recent alarm is partially based on the idea that disability accommodations create reliance on external assistance while simultaneously diminishing the need for personal responsibility. Yes, we do rely on external assistance to be healthy and productive every day, in the same way a person requires glasses to see properly or a person with diabetes needs insulin. Knowing your disability rights and asking for legally mandated accommodations is the epitome of personal responsibility and not letting a disability impede daily life.
Rather than even a lopsided playing field, critics would rather “fix” us so we can conform to a neurotypical world or risk shutting us out altogether.  (Whipping the ADHD out of children is one of the latest suggestions.  I have firsthand experience that this method doesn’t work.)
But I don’t want to be “fixed” because I am not deficient, ashamed or broken. People with disabilities are different, not better or worse or the same. What we want are basic human rights and dignity that include: the ability to live up to our potential; fairly compete with our peers; be a productive and contributing member to society; and the opportunity to fully participate in everything life has to offer.
A person living with paralysis from the waist down will never be able to walk up a flight of stairs in the same way I will never be an organized, focused student.  These behaviors are a matter of skill, not will.  If you think having a disability is a coveted status, try living with one every day in this country.  Live long enough and you eventually will.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1210226489-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 14:11:38.484534

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)To California Democratic state Sen. David Cortese, the idea of gaining Republican support for a bill to provide cash to certain residents would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.
But his proposed legislation to offer $1,000 per month to homeless youth has so far received bipartisan support in the state Senate.
“It’s being embraced,” said Cortese. “This was not even considered possible five years ago.”
Cortese is among more than 20 Democratic lawmakers from 17 states launching Legislators for a Guaranteed Income on Tuesday to advocate for programs that provide direct, regular cash payments to lower-income residents to help alleviate poverty. They join a network of more than 245 mayors and county officials who have pursued dozens of basic income pilot projects across the country.
Washington state House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, and Washington state Senator T’wina Nobles, D-Fircrest, are among the founding members of the state lawmaker group.
The lawmakers want to see states play a larger role in guaranteed income programs, which aim to help residents in need by handing out no-strings-attached cash.
The concept of basic income programs took off following a 2019 experiment in Stockton, California. There, 125 individuals received $500 per month for two years, which researchers found improved their financial stability and health.
Michael Tubbs, the former Democratic mayor of Stockton and current executive chairman of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, said these kinds of efforts are more important now as economic uncertainty and high prices squeeze the most vulnerable people.
“The work around guaranteed income is moving from cities and counties to states,” he said. “We’re going to be organizing state officials across the country who see what we all see: that affordability is an issue, that the Trump tariffs and gross mismanagement of the economy has made the problem even worse.”
While the concept has gained traction across the country, Republican state lawmakers have pushed bills to ban basic income programs, arguing they disincentivize work.
Last year, then-state Sen. John Wiik sponsored successful legislation banning South Dakota localities from launching basic income programs. At the time, the Republican said he was worried about people growing dependent upon the government.
“So, if you get people addicted to just getting a check from the government, it’s going to be really hard to take that away,” he told Stateline.
Legislators for a Guaranteed Income says its 23 members have so far introduced 25 bills across 11 states.
Those include Cortese’s proposed legislation in California to create a new program to help homeless youth transition out of high school.
Eligible students would receive four monthly payments of $1,000 each beginning in May. That bill, expected to cost $40 million to $50 million, has passed through two state Senate committees.
Cortese previously advocated for a 2023 California program that was the nation’s first state-funded pilot of a basic income program targeting former foster youth. He pointed to research showing basic income programs supplement, rather than replace, the need for work. And he said growing these programs can eventually reduce costs for other social safety net programs.
“I’m so pleased to see the proliferation that we’ve seen so far,” he said. “I think that it will become ubiquitous as a way of doing things and that’s going to outlast me and my career.”
In Pennsylvania, Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta said he’s still exploring details on legislation for a basic income program there.
He said pilot projects across the country have proven that people pay rent, buy groceries and invest in small businesses when they have more financial freedom.
“So, this isn’t really some big experiment,” he said. “It is a proven way to reduce poverty, improve health care, boost our local economies and really get a real return on that investment.”
Kenyatta said so-called trickle-down policies that aim to boost business interests and high earners have failed many ordinary people.
“But basic income really flips that equation on its head,” he said. “It’s not about charity. It’s about power, and about giving people the power and the resources to breathe.”

Because the child did not travel outside the state, this indicates the first case of community spread this year, according to a press release. 
Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause severe health complications. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis and rash, according to the health department. Patients are infectious both four days before and after they develop a rash. 
The individual was not fully vaccinated and lives in Faulkner County. While infectious, the person visited Conway Regional Greenbrier Family Medicine from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. on April 18 and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on April 21. The individual also visited Irby Dance Studio in Conway from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. on April 23, according to the release. 
The state health department will be contacting potentially exposed individuals and is urging anyone at the identified locations to get up to date on the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine as quickly as possible. If the vaccine is given soon after exposure, it can stop the infection from developing, according to health officials. 
Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates

Anyone who may have been exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure. People who develop symptoms should inform their health care provider that they were potentially exposed to measles and are now experiencing symptoms, according to the release.
Because there is evidence of community spread in Faulkner County, vaccine recommendations for anyone living in or traveling to Faulkner County and surrounding counties (Cleburne, Conway, Lonoke, Perry, Pulaski, Van Buren and White) have been updated.
ADH reported the state’s first case of pediatric measles since 2018 on April 10. The unvaccinated Saline County resident was exposed during out-of-state travel. ADH reported a second case that same day in an unvaccinated Faulkner County resident who was also exposed during travel.
There were nearly 900 confirmed cases of measles in 30 states as of April 24, more than three times the cases in all of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The vast majority of confirmed cases, around 650 as of last week, are in Texas where an outbreak started in the western part of the state about three months ago. Two unvaccinated school-aged children living in the outbreak area have died, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. 
A new poll by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF found a correlation between false claims about measles and lower vaccination rates. 
More information about measles, including a list of Arkansas measles exposure locations, is available on the state health department’s website.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A Rapid City-based nonprofit that advocates for children in the state court system lost $15,000 last week after the federal government terminated grant awards to the National Court Appointed Special Advocates Association.
The decision “abandons American children” and will cause ripple effects throughout the state, said Seventh Circuit CASA Program Executive Director Kehala Two Bulls. The organization serves children in Pennington, Fall River and Custer counties. Seven other organizations serve South Dakota’s other circuit courts.
Volunteers with CASA advocate for children who’ve been removed from their families and placed in state care due to suspected abuse and neglect. The volunteers meet with the children and other contacts, such as teachers, therapists and caseworkers. They also write reports to judges about the children’s needs, strengths and interests to create “customized services and decision making,” Two Bulls said.


Federal fallout

Over 330 CASA volunteers worked with 658 children in 37 counties last year, according to the state Unified Judicial System.
The national organization suspended all services and support to state and local programs, it announced last week, after the Trump administration’s Department of Justice terminated funding.
In a statement to Reuters, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said grants were rescinded that “do not align with the administration’s priorities,” but she said the Department of Justice will “continue to ensure that services for victims are not impacted and any recipient will have the ability to appeal and restore any grant if direct impact on victims can be thoroughly established.” The national CASA office said it is appealing.
Though the Seventh Circuit was the only South Dakota CASA office receiving grant funds from the national office, other local organizations rely on services provided by the national organization. That includes training and coordination, Two Bulls said.
Shifting that administrative burden and coordination to states will result in redundancy and reduced efficiencies, she added.
“Children will be destabilized by these changes,” Two Bulls said. “It’s important for people to make these decisions responsibly. Whether people agree with this or not, there’s a need for people at a local level to partner with us and step up and come up with the funding, the infrastructure, the support needed, because these are real kids that deserve good futures.”
Seventh Circuit CASA was awarded $25,000 in grant funding this year — $5,000 to conduct background checks of volunteers and $20,000 to develop support and specialized services for older youth in the system. The organization already received and spent about $10,000, but won’t receive the remaining $15,000.
In 2014, 207 kids in the Seventh Circuit were in state care over the course of the year, Two Bulls said. In 2024, that grew to 795 children because cases are taking longer to resolve.
Older children are staying in the system longer and aging out once they turn 18 years old, she added. Last year, 35 kids aged out of foster care in the area. Nearly a decade ago, that number was closer to five children a year. About 80% of the Seventh Circuit CASA’s cases are Indian Child Welfare Act cases.










Children will be destabilized by these changes.


– Kehala Two Bulls, executive director, Seventh Circuit CASA Program


Youth who age out of the system are more likely to become homeless, incarcerated or die than their peers, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Two Bulls said the grant was intended to build supplemental training for advocates focused on building life skills for older children.
The grants amounted to about 5% of the organization’s operating budget, Two Bulls said. While the terminated funding won’t shutter the program, she’ll have to reallocate funds or find new revenue for the increasing need the grant was intended to address.
“This action was completely disconnected from the need and the vulnerability in our community,” Two Bulls said. “What we have is less funding and less infrastructure to properly address it. We’re painfully aware of how many kids it leaves at risk.”
Greg Sattizahn, state court administrator for the South Dakota Unified Judicial System, said in a news release that the state is committed to “providing leadership, support and encouragement” to the eight CASA nonprofits across the state.

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)The House had its final debate Monday on the “big budget bill,” with legislators on the right lambasting spending, and the sponsor defending the increases as paying for the big ticket items Montanans want — such as property tax relief.
Rep. Terry Falk, R-Kalispell, said Gov. Greg Gianforte handed legislators a bloated budget, and it was still too big on the cusp of its near final vote.
Although it was Day 83 of a session that’s a maximum 90 days, Falk said it wasn’t too late to trim the budget, to return more money to taxpayers, contrary to the lyrics of a country song, it’s “too late to do the right thing now.”
“That might be true in love. I don’t think it’s true in budgets,” Falk said.
As the session nears a close, the argument brought political divisions into focus, including a dynamic in the Senate. There, “The Nine” Republicans and all Democrats teamed up as a working majority, frustrating more conservative Republican leadership.
In the House debate, members of the Freedom Caucus condemned Gianforte for presenting a “smoke and mirrors” budget in House Bill 2, and hardline Republicans faulted their colleagues for going along with it.
But Republicans in support of HB 2 said its critics wanted to unfairly characterize the budget as a failure to score political points, and Democratic supporter Rep. Mary Caferro of Helena said it takes care of the basics.
“The House passed a fair budget over to the Senate, and then the Senate made it even more fair, particularly for the working-class people of Montana and their families,” Caferro said.
Monday, the House voted 67-33 to agree with the changes the Senate had made to HB 2 last week, with support from all 42 Democrats and 25 Republicans, albeit some frustrated ones.
In support of taking the budget to the finish line, but against the idea to send it to committee for a trim, Majority Leader Steve Fitzpatrick said any more work on the budget would just backfire.
Fitzpatrick, R-Great Falls, said he didn’t have any particular love for the budget, but it was high time to be done with it before it grew even bigger.
He pointed in particular to a lack of restraint in the subcommittee that handled the health department — “our Section B can’t say ‘no.’” But he said neither could others along the way.
“I sit here and pull my hair out some days wondering what happened to the Republican party,” Fitzpatrick said.
In a later debate over another bill, he told Republicans it was time to be “fiscal conservatives, not part-time fiscal conservatives.”
On the floor, however, sponsor and Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, said the increases criticized in the budget represent legislative priorities and needs of Montanans, and the budget is balanced.
The most recent tally shows $224.8 million unspent at the end of the 2027 biennium.
After the debate, Jones said he believes that amount will increase as bills currently accounted for fail to pass, and as the governor potentially vetoes some spending.
The 2027 biennium budget costs 17% more than the 2025 biennium budget so far, and critics in the legislature have highlighted the figure as much too steep.
Jones, though, sponsor of House Bill 2 and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said those costs include as much as $200 million in property tax relief.
He said if giving Montanans their money back is wrong, “then we should be wrong every day.”
The increase also includes nearly $100 million more required in the state match by the federal government for Medicaid, another $100 million for education, and money for “backing the blue,” he said.
Once large items are accounted for, Jones said, the increase looks more like 4% each year, in line with inflation.
“Yes, the budget is bigger,” Jones said. “We’re returning money to taxpayers. We’re keeping criminals off the street. We’re protecting our elders and vulnerable neighbors, and we’re taking care of health care.”
But Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, said the budget isn’t fully transparent with taxpayers, an “illusion” from the start.
“It was presented from the governor as a smoke-and-mirrors budget,” said Gillette, a member of the Freedom Caucus.
She said the governor tried to present some spending as outside of HB 2 in order for his proposal to appear more conservative than it was, but legislators didn’t sign onto the idea.
However, Gillette also said the Senate took a $50 million bite out of HB 2 for contract nurses, helping the most vulnerable patients including at the state hospital.
The Senate added $15 million back for hiring employees at the state hospital instead. But Gillette said the health department would spend all the money anyway.
Gillette said the agency has the authority to dip into other funds it controls, and it would simply scrape $35 million out of another bucket, such as for children or nursing homes.
“They’ll take money from next year’s general fund. It’s just putting it on the credit card,” said Gillette, chairperson of the subcommittee that reviews the health department budget.
Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, though, asked the House to reject Gillette’s testimony.
He said the Department of Public Health and Human Services had been spending money profligately on traveling nurses, largely at the state hospital.
“The department of health … did absolutely nothing to hire state employees at the state hospital, and I mean absolutely nothing,” Fitzpatrick said.
He said Gillette’s subcommittee had included $75 million for traveling nurses. Yet state employees were more affordable than contract travelers, he said — a cost of $91,000 compared to $280,000.
Roughly six weeks ago, however, he said the governor told him, as did health department staff at a more recent committee hearing, that the agency had finally started hiring, and at a rate of one nurse a week.
If that was the case, he said, it didn’t need $75 million for traveling nurses, and the Senate rightly stripped out that money.
“It’s time to make the Department of Public Health and Human Services accountable to the people of Montana, to make a real effort at hiring state employees,” Fitzpatrick said.
“They’re claiming they can do it. Fine. Let’s hold their feet to the fire, and if they don’t get the job done, then we’ll have a real serious discussion about the supplemental (budget request) next time.”
But Rep. Jerry Schillinger, R-Circle, blamed the Senate for the results in HB 2, pointing the finger at the working majority in the Senate, the coalition of Democrats and nine Republicans.
He said the Senate’s Finance and Claims Committee didn’t scrutinize the budget for long, but it wasn’t fully in control, with bills being blasted out of its hands.
“The chaos that started on Day One continues to this day, and we see it on House Bill 2,” said Schillinger, a Freedom Caucus member.
Jones called the allegation the budget was “smoke and mirrors” the “new term of the hour,” and said it must be “the saddest magic show on earth” given the numbers on spreadsheets and results for taxpayers.
After the debate, Rep. David Bedey, R-Hamilton, said some of the accusations on the floor were about showmanship and political games, not crafting a budget that works for Montanans.
“It’s evident from the rhetoric we heard when House Bill 2 was on the floor that several members of the House are creating soundbites for the purpose of attacking their political enemies,” Bedey said.
He said some of the Republicans who spoke against the budget want to paint a negative picture for political purposes.
“The idea is to portray the budget as a failure,” Bedey said. “The budget is balanced. It meets the needs of the state and provides the government services that the citizens of Montana expect with respect to education, health care and criminal justice.”
HB 2 is scheduled for its last vote on Tuesday before it heads to the governor’s desk.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos01-scaled-e1731707160413-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

(Courtesy of CommonWealth Beacon)President Donald Trump raked in nearly $4.1 million for his 2025 inauguration from donors and businesses with Massachusetts addresses, just under 2% of the total $239 million raised for the parties tied to his swearing-in for a second term in January.
Trump’s inaugural committee reported the names and figures earlier this month in a filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which showed the president beating the previous record he set: $107 million for his first inauguration. Presidential inaugurations feature the oath of office as well as official and unofficial balls or galas in Washington, D.C., offering a way for companies and individuals to ingratiate themselves with a new administration.
Large corporations made appearances on the list, including e-commerce giant Amazon and Facebook owner Meta, which each gave $1 million. The largest donation, coming in at $5 million, was from Pilgrim’s Pride, a poultry producer based in Colorado. Cryptocurrency interests also donated, with Ripple Labs donating $4.9 million.
The 21 Massachusetts donors and businesses, with donations totaling roughly $4.1 million, fell below their counterparts in other states, such as Pennsylvania ($8.6 million) and Michigan ($6.4 million). Both were swing states in 2024, while Massachusetts has remained a Democratic stronghold, with Ronald Reagan the last Republican to win the Bay State in 1984.
CommonWealth Beacon reviewed the Trump inauguration fundraising committee’s filing with the Federal Election Commission, which included donors and companies listing Massachusetts addresses. One of the largest donors in the state was a company tied to billionaire and car dealership magnate Ernie Boch Jr. The company, which is called Boston Port Service and shares an address with his nonprofit charity Music Drives Us, donated $1 million. Boch, who previously hosted a fundraiser for Trump in 2015, was unreachable for comment.
DraftKings, the Boston-based gambling company with a focus on sports betting, gave $502,000, while FanDuel, its New York-based rival, gave $482,000.
Another $500,000 came from GE Vernova, a Cambridge-based energy technology company working in the renewable power sector. The company, whose wind power division is grappling with a White House that has sought to put a stop to new wind turbine projects, spun off from the conglomerate General Electric in 2024. (CommonWealth Beacon reached out to DraftKings and GE Vernova for comment but did not hear back.)
Jessica Beeson Tocco, the CEO of A10 Associates, which bills itself as the country’s “largest woman-owned bipartisan lobbying firm,” personally donated $101,652 to the Trump inauguration committee and then an additional $50,000 through her Malden-based company. (The company also hosted a cocktail reception at the Waldorf Astoria the weekend before the inauguration, according to Politico.)
One of her clients, Quantum Computing Inc. CEO William McGann, also donated $101,652. He is retiring from the technology company in May and is listed as having an East Falmouth address on the FEC’s records.
Reached for comment, Tocco stressed that her firm’s donations go to top elected officials in both parties, with contributions flowing to prominent Massachusetts Democrats like US Sen. Ed Markey, Gov. Maura Healey, and Congresswoman Lori Trahan.
A potential Healey rival for the corner office in the State House, Michael Minogue, donated $250,000 to the Trump inauguration committee. Minogue, who now has his own consulting firm after serving as president and CEO of medical technology company Abiomed, has previously donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican National Committee and the state GOP. He also gave several thousand dollars to former Gov. Charlie Baker and Josh Kraft, who is looking to unseat Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, according to publicly available campaign finance records.
Others gave smaller amounts. Sriprakash Kothari, an accounting professor at MIT and a Lexington resident who regularly donates to the state GOP, gave $2,500 to the Trump inauguration committee. Kothari, who worked as the chief economist for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during the first Trump administration, declined to comment about the donation.
Some of the donors, like the company tied to Boch, had to be tracked through corporate documents on file with the Massachusetts secretary of state’s office. For example, Randolph-based GGBF Inc. donated $50,000 to the Trump inauguration committee, according to the FEC filing.
Documents on file with the state show the company shares the same address and same president as NEI General Contracting, Josef Rettman. Rettman has mostly donated to Democrats at the state and local level, and a mix at the federal level, including U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Trump White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s 2022 congressional campaign in New Hampshire.
The list of donors to the inauguration committee did not include the names of some major donors who had previously contributed to the first Trump presidential campaign or the first inauguration in 2017. Jim Davis, the chairman of shoemaker New Balance, donated nearly $400,000 to support Trump’s 2016 campaign.
The Kraft Group, tied to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, didn’t donate to the 2025 inauguration after donating $1 million for the 2017 inauguration. Ahead of the 2024 election, Kraft distanced himself from Trump, saying he was “very upset” by the insurrection attempt to keep Trump in office on January 6, 2021. Kraft has since reportedly helped a law firm, Paul Weiss, broker a peace deal with Trump, who has targeted lawyers through executive orders.
“I made a strong donation to his [2017] inauguration,” Kraft said during an appearance on a radio show last October. “I couldn’t believe it, it was like having someone who was a drunk fraternity brother become president of the United States.”

The state's perpetual ranking as among the deadliest in the nation for workers points to systemic disregard, advocates say.
The post In honoring fallen workers, advocates call for action in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—A silver triangle rang out 45 times in the Capitol’s rotunda. Each ring commemorated a worker who went to work in Wyoming in 2023 and didn’t return home to their families because they were killed on the job.
About three dozen people — mostly from local unions — gathered for the Workers Memorial Day ceremony on a cool and wet Monday evening.
“Every person who goes to work deserves to come home,” said Marcie Kindred, executive director of the Wyoming AFL-CIO. “Every family deserves the peace of knowing their loved ones are protected. Every life lost is one too many.”
The Rev. Delaney Piper, pastor of Highlands Presbyterian Church, led the group in prayer.
“Oh God, we do not understand why deaths like this, that we remember, that we mourn today, occur,” Piper said. “More so, we do not understand why everyone — workers, business leaders and political leaders — don’t just join in taking decisive action to prevent future deaths and to protect workers.”

The annual event recognizes Workers Memorial Day, the anniversary of the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act. The measure, in response to the carnage of workplace fatalities, injuries and illnesses, is supposed to ensure safe work conditions. Though accidents do happen, Kindred said, far too many are entirely preventable and, collectively, they point to a systemic disregard for workers.
“Behind every workplace fatality lies a story [of a life] cut short too soon and a ripple of grief that continues long after the headlines fade,” Kindred said.
Kindred and other speakers noted that Wyoming’s 45 occupational fatalities in 2023 made it the deadliest state in the nation for workers that year — a distinction Wyoming has held far too many times. Marcia Shanor, executive director of the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association and a longtime worker advocate, said the annual commitment to demand safer working conditions appears to ring hollow among state leaders.

Cummings told the crowd that he was motivated to fight for safe working conditions to ensure that his children would always have a father present. (Ivy Secrest/WyoFile)
“We have committed, every single year for the last 20 years, to do better,” Shanor said. “And here we are, 20 years later, decades later, with one of the highest workplace fatality rates since 2007. It feels hollow to have to say those words that I have said every single year as we have remembered the great people who keep our state working.”
United Steelworkers Local 13214 President Marshal Cummings, who works at the WE Soda trona mine near Green River, believes Wyoming’s perpetual worker fatality epidemic is the result of a disregard for workers enshrined in its “right-to-work” laws. Such laws ostensibly protect employees from being forced to join a union. But, in Cummings’ estimation, the laws are specifically intended to limit the power of unions, along with their persuasion to hold employers accountable for worker safety. 
“Let’s be very clear about this: right-to-work is a lie,” Cummings said. “It’s not about jobs. It’s not about freedom. It’s about weakening the very organizations — our unions — that keep us safe.”
In states with right-to-work laws, workers see lower wages, fewer health benefits and weaker retirement security, according to Cummings.
“Most importantly, workplaces [in right-to-work states] are more dangerous,” he said. “What is the right to liberty if you can’t speak up on dangerous conditions because you might be fired if you do? What’s the right to personal happiness if you’re trapped in a system where your work, your blood, your sweat, your tears, if your sacrifice is treated as disposable?”

Wyoming is the deadliest state in the nation for workers, again 



For now, the Wyoming AFL-CIO is focusing its legislative efforts not on the state’s right-to-work laws, but on the larger and more immediate goal of improving workplace safety, according to Kindred. The union group, the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association and other worker advocates see an opportunity to reignite past statewide efforts that had nudged Wyoming toward safer workplaces — efforts that seemed to fizzle out after the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It shouldn’t be one time a year that we all get together and talk about why this is an important issue,” Shanor said. “We should be having those conversations at the workplace, upstairs [in the House and Senate chambers], the governor’s office, and we should have leadership by our elected officials in helping us actually make steps forward that stay in place.”

Senate Bill 394, “Prohibit Foreign Ownership of NC Land,” passed without discussion after the panel approved a technical amendment. The legislation now moves to the Senate Rules Committee.
The bill comes at the same time that tensions between the U.S. a several other nations have been on the rise as the result of the Trump administration’s economic tariffs and other foreign policy shifts.
Sens. Bob Brinson (R-Beaufort, Craven, Lenoir), Bobby Hanig (R-Bertie, Camden, Currituck, Dare, Gates, Hertford, Northampton, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Tyrrell), and Timothy Moffitt (R-Henderson, Polk, Rutherford) serve as the primary sponsors for SB 394.
The bill would prohibit the “adversarial” nations of China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from making claims to land that is agricultural, situated within a 25-mile radius of a military installation, or underneath special use airspace as designated by the Federal Aviation Administration.
Lawmakers on the same committee reviewed SB 394 during a meeting on April 16, prior to taking a one-week recess. During that session, legislators discussed the bill but did not vote.
“This bill essentially acknowledges that food security is national security and it’s a state effort to protect our military bases,” Brinson said during that meeting.
Entities falling under the bill’s stipulations who own the land prior to the legislation becoming law, if it happens, would need to register with the secretary of state and attorney general.
Twelve states have already enacted similar measures, according to Brinson.
Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham) asked if the bill would apply to dual citizens and prohibit them from owning farmland in North Carolina.
Legislative staff responded that individuals holding U.S. citizenship, permanent residence, or other forms of lawful presence would not be subject to the measure.
Chitlik also asked if the bill would pose challenges to the Fair Housing Act, which makes it illegal to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing due to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability.
Brinson said the legislation was modeled after language in Florida, where it did not run into issues.
“It doesn’t mention nationality, it mentions citizenship,” Brinson said. “There is a distinction and a difference.”

(Photo courtesy of USD)Nine South Dakota law school students have been selected as the first participants in a pilot program that could allow them to become lawyers without passing the state bar exam.
The Public Service Pathway Bar Admission Pilot Program is an outgrowth of a yearslong debate on the value of the bar exam as a measure of fitness for legal service in the state. For about a decade, bar exam critics in South Dakota have criticized the timed test as a barrier to the profession that can prevent otherwise competent lawyers from service based not on their ability, but on slower reading speeds or extra time spent fine-tuning their analysis.
Pilot program will allow new lawyers to swap public service for the bar exam

The pilot program creates an alternative route to bar licensure by combining legal education and practical experience. Law school students selected for the program must complete a minimum of two years of full-time public service employment, such as in the office of a state’s attorney or public defender, upon admission to practice law in the state.
The University of South Dakota Knudson School of Law, in partnership with the host public service entities, selected the nine participants from 13 applicants.
“This program reflects our commitment to shaping lawyers who are not only skilled and ethical but also dedicated to serving the public good,” said Knudson School of Law Dean Neil Fulton in a news release. “It provides an innovative, rigorous pathway to licensure that emphasizes real-world experience and professional responsibility.”
Participants have been placed to work with the Minnehaha County Public Defender’s Office in Sioux Falls, Brown County State’s Attorney’s Office in Aberdeen, Minnehaha County State’s Attorney’s Office in Sioux Falls, Pennington County State’s Attorney’s Office in Rapid City, and the Federal Public Defender’s Office in Sioux Falls. Attorneys with the host entities will supervise, mentor and assist each participant.
Program participants will be required to submit a portfolio of their work during the program. The Board of Bar Examiners will evaluate the work and perform a character and fitness review of each participant before making a recommendation regarding a participant’s admission to practice as an attorney in South Dakota.
The five-year pilot program is administered through the cooperation of the USD Knudson School of Law and the state Board of Bar Examiners. The program is open to students at the law school and limited to a maximum of 10 students that meet specific criteria in each law school class during the pilot.

(Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A losing legal battle that stretched over nearly 10 years has potentially quadrupled the cost Missouri taxpayers must pay to a software firm fired in 2016 as it worked to modernize the state’s social services enrollment system.
In January, the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals upheld a $23 million jury award to EngagePoint, handed down in 2022 for work it performed but for which it was never paid. The judgment included 9% interest starting in May 2015 for one portion of the award, a little over $4 million, and starting in March 2016 for another claim for $19 million.
The Missouri Supreme Court at the beginning of April declined to hear another appeal and the Senate Appropriations Committee has, at the request of Gov. Mike Kehoe, included $92.7 million to pay off the judgment. Of that amount, $48.8 is from general revenue and $43.9 millions from federal funds.
“The state asked our client to do a whole lot of extra work, and a jury found it had agreed to pay our client for that extra work,” said attorney Chuck Hatfield, who represented EngagePoint and its successor claimant, HHS Technology Group.
EngagePoint, a Florida-based firm, was hired by the state in 2013 in response to a request for proposals for a vendor to implement the Missouri Human Services Eligibility, Enrollment and Case Management System, a comprehensive, fully-integrated system for Department of Social Services’ programs, like Medicaid.
EngagePoint was hired over competitors such as IBM, and alleged in its lawsuit that the state ignored the company’s advice and licensed a software directly from IBM and then later held EngagePoint accountable for flaws with the software, which was “unstable and not functionally ready.”
Problems with the Missouri Eligibility Determination and Enrollment System that EngagePoint was hired to implement continue to be an issue. The system was blamed for delays in enrolling newly eligible participants under expanded Medicaid. The state cited updates to the state’s Medicaid system to make eligibility determinations as the reason applications wouldn’t be processed for 60 days after the state was court-ordered to implement expanded Medicaid in 2021.
In May 2024, federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in a letter sent to the state that it was concerned the state is not doing enough to “achieve and sustain” compliance with federal rules on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Missouri was among the worst states in the nation for processing times, with 72% of applications taking more than 45 days to process in February 2024. The processing times have improved, and the latest report from the Department of Social Services shows the average processing time in March was 38 days.
HHS Technology acquired EngagePoint’s claims for the contract dispute lawsuit and was substituted as the plaintiff. It sued DSS in 2023, alleging the state violated Missouri’s Sunshine Law by refusing to turn over public records that it was denied in the litigation over the software work.
In September, Circuit Judge Jon Beetem determined that the department violated the Sunshine Law by wrongfully withholding public records based on the identity of requester and not the contents of the records. The department also took months to respond to the request without a reasonable justification, Beetem ruled.
Beetem ordered the state to pay a $5,000 fine for a knowing violation of the Sunshine Law and $115,200 in attorney fees and costs. An appeal is pending before the Western District Court of Appeals.
Whether the entire $92.7 million — four times the original judgment — will be paid out is uncertain.
A calculation of interest since the 2022 judgment shows that the $4 million portion of the award will be about $9.8 million on June 30, the final day of the current fiscal year, and the $19 million portion will have grown to $42.3 million.
The budget takes effect July 1 and the final cost will be determined by when the state makes the payment, with interest adding about $13,000 a day to the cost.
“The judgments got really big,” Hatfield said, “because there’s both pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, pursuant to Missouri law.”

,DC,2025-04-29 16:38:53+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Relief on auto tariffs coming, Treasury secretary says",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/relief-auto-tariffs-coming-treasury-secretary-says,,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled a reprieve on auto tariffs will come Tuesday ahead of the president’s stop in Michigan to mark his first 100 days in office.Bessent and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Tuesday curtailing the import taxes for domestic car manufacturers, but offered few specifics. The president’s 25% levy on cars and auto parts went into effect at the beginning of April.“I’m not going to go into the details of the auto tariff relief, but I can tell you that it will go substantially toward reshoring American auto manufacturing,” Bessent said. “And again, the goal here is to bring back the high-quality industrial jobs to the U.S.”The press secretary and Bessent began the day defending Trump’s trade policy as part of a weeklong morning press conference series marking the 100-day milestone in Trump’s second administration.Investors and businesses have been on edge since Trump declared foreign trade a national emergency on April 2 and imposed what he billed as “reciprocal” tariffs on nearly every nation. Trump issued a 90-day pause on the steep levies — some reaching nearly 50% — after trillions of dollars disappeared from U.S. and world markets in reaction to the dramatic policy.However, Trump dug in his heels on goods from China, increasing tariffs to 145%. Nearly all other countries face universal 10% baseline levy.No deals yetNearly a month after the tariffs went into effect, Bessent told reporters the administration has not yet inked deals with any of the 17 trading partners, not counting China, currently in negotiations with the U.S. When pressed about a timeline for the deals, Bessent said Trump has created “strategic uncertainty” as a tool to get the best terms.“I think the aperture of uncertainty will be narrowing, and as we start moving toward announcing deals, then there will be certainty. But certainty is not necessarily a good thing in negotiating,” Bessent said.Bessent sidestepped questions about trade talks with China, saying he wouldn’t get “into the nitty-gritty of who’s talking to whom.” China has imposed 125% tariffs on U.S. goods and has denied any meaningful negotiations.“I think that, you know, over time, we will see that the Chinese tariffs are unsustainable for China,” Bessent said, adding that China sends more goods to the U.S. than Americans send to China.Americans' approval of Trump’s job performance, particularly on economic policy, is lagging, according to numerous recent surveys.In response to a report that Amazon will highlight spikes in prices due to tariffs, Leavitt said the e-commerce behemoth was committing a “hostile and political act.” Punchbowl News reported the story Tuesday citing “a person familiar with the plan.”Amazon denied the report hours later, according to NPR and other outlets.Tax cutsWhen asked about potential economic damage from business owners clamping down on hiring and growth, Bessent told reporters “tax cuts are coming.”The secretary said he and Trump met at the White House Monday with congressional Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota.Johnson and Thune have signaled different timelines — from Memorial Day to further into summer — for when Congress would finish a large budget reconciliation package, at the heart of which is Trump’s plan to extend his 2017 tax law.Bessent said Trump wants the tax bill to revive and expand full business expensing, meaning businesses could write off expenses for certain investments, like equipment.“The other thing that we are looking to add is full expensing for factories,” Bessent said. “So bring your factory back, you can fully expense the equipment and the building.”",,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

House Bill 859 is sponsored by Rep. Cody Honeycutt (R-Montgomery). It would prohibit the establishment of guaranteed income programs without express authorization of “general or local law” — something that would require approval from the General Assembly. It was referred to the House State and Local Government Committee without discussion.
Guaranteed income programs provide individuals or families with cash payments generally with no strings attached. The cash payments may be used for necessities such as food, childcare expenses, medicine and transportation.
The goal is to provide low-income families or individuals with a steady income to increase financial stability.
Supporters see such programs as a way to help lift families and individuals out of poverty and to address income inequality. Meanwhile, critics argue that such programs create a disincentive for work, are expensive and will not reduce dependency on welfare programs as some supporters claim.
Under HB 859, programs under which an individual is required to seek reemployment, perform work or attend training as a condition of a cash payment would be exempt from the law.
In North Carolina, the City of Durham launched a guaranteed income pilot program for formerly incarcerated individuals in March 2022 titled Excel. The pilot ended in August 2024.
Assistant Durham City Manager Karmisha Wallace told NC Newsline that the city council allocated $1 million this fiscal year to continue the program, which the city would manage. A nonprofit administered the pilot program.
Wallace said the city has neither determined the amount of the monthly stipend under the new program nor the number of participants. Under the pilot, 109 formerly incarcerated individuals received $600 a month for one year.
She said training for justice involved individuals is already available through other city-run programs in which they participate.
“We already have programming in place now that help justice involved individuals get IDs, get jobs, secure medical support, transportation and that sort of thing,” Wallace said.
Wallace said HB 859 could be problematic.
“I think it’s safe to say the city is concerned about any legislation that restricts our abilities to meet the needs of our constituents,” Wallace said.
According to the Durham County website, the county is launching a guaranteed income pilot program called DCo Thrives that will provide $750 per month for one year to 125 randomly selected low-income families. That program is funded by the American Rescue Plan Act and will be administered by Durham Children’s Initiative, according to the website. 
Guaranteed income programs gained steam during the pandemic. Large cities such as Los Angeles and Atlanta are among those that launched pilot programs.
Michael D. Tubbs, founder and chair or Mayors & Counties for a Guaranteed Income, said last summer in a letter defending a program in Harris County (home to the city of Houston) that was blocked by the Texas Supreme Court that there were more than 100 pilot programs nationwide in-process or having concluded with “great success.”
Tubbs is a former Stockton, California mayor who helped launch one of the country’s first guaranteed income programs in 2019.
The Harris County program is still on hold due to the legal challenge. Last week, the Texas Senate approved a bill to ban local governments from adopting such programs.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2889-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Insurance companies handily gained an advantage Monday in the Louisiana Legislature’s debate over how to bring down the state’s exorbitant auto coverage rates. Lawmakers worked well into the evening to approve a long list of bills that target personal injury lawsuits, which they said  is the primary cause of high premiums.  
House Bill 34, sponsored by Rep. Brian Glorioso, R-Slidell, passed the House of Representatives in a 68-26 vote and now heads to the Senate for consideration. It would allow any party in a lawsuit that stems from an auto accident to introduce evidence related to medical expenses.  
Current law prevents juries from seeing what accident victims actually pay for medical treatment and only allows access to what a doctor billed. In many instances, however, medical providers don’t actually receive the full amounts that they bill. Sometimes, Glorioso said, lawyers work with doctors who will inflate their medical billings just to get an increased payout for the plaintiff. Also, health insurers often do not pay doctors the full amounts they bill.
Glorioso’s bill would limit a plaintiff’s recovery of medical expenses to “reasonable” amounts, which would be left for a judge or jury to decide. 
The vote on the bill fell mostly along party lines with two defections from each side. Democrats Pat Moore of Monroe and Steven Jackson of Shreveport voted in favor of the proposal. Republicans Jeremy LaCombe of Livonia, an attorney, and Joe Stagni of Kenner opposed it. 
During floor debate, several Democrats pointed to similar tort reform bills from years prior that failed to reduce Louisiana’s auto insurance rates, which remain among the highest in the country.  
Rep. Sylvia Taylor, D-LaPlace asked Glorioso whether he could say for certain that his bill would lower premiums — a question heard frequently from Democrats as Republicans have presented their insurance bills. Glorioso, who’s a lawyer, rejected the premise of the argument. 
“If that is the standard by which we’re going to pass insurance bills, we may as well go home,” Glorioso said, implying that such guarantees would be impossible to make. 
House Bill 435, by Rep. Peter Egan, R-Covington, passed in a 62-23 vote and drew some of the more colorful debate of the evening — even though it’s unlikely to have much of an impact on auto insurance rates. It puts a ceiling on the amount a person can be awarded in a lawsuit, capping general damages at $5 million even in the case of wrongful death.
When the bill came up for a hearing last week in the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure, lawmakers pointed out that it won’t directly lower rates because $5 million is already the maximum payout on commercial auto policies in Louisiana. Insurance companies currently don’t pay any more than that regardless of how much a jury awards a plaintiff.
Nevertheless, Egan has said his bill would stem what he believes is a culture of litigiousness in Louisiana if people understand they can no longer receive huge jury awards. 
Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, an attorney, questioned how Republicans can claim to be “pro-life” if they would support a bill that effectively establishes a $5 million maximum value on a person’s life.
“This cap is the opposite of pro-life,” Jordan said. “If you were truly pro-life, you would not succumb and agree with the premise that we should be putting [value] caps on people’s lives.”
Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, argued Louisiana residents are overwhelmingly complaining of excessive litigation and asking lawmakers to fix the tort system in an effort to lower rates. 
House Bill 439, by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette, passed in a 57-30 vote with LaCombe and Stagni joining Democrats in opposition. The bill aims to limit contingency fees, the money a lawyer makes off a percentage of the lawsuit winnings, to 10% on the first $15,000 in damages. Settlements with insurers for most minor accidents fall under this ceiling. For any damages beyond $15,000, Hebert’s bill would not limit lawyer payments. 

House Bill 431, by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, passed in a 66-26 vote along strict party lines. The bill would limit the ability for people to recover damages for injuries sustained in accidents for which they are mostly at fault.
Her bill would change Louisiana’s comparative fault statute, which assigns a percentage of blame to each party in an accident and allows for the recovery of damages in proportion with those percentages. 
Under current law, a person partly at fault in an accident would be liable for their share of the damages and can recover the remaining amount found to be the fault of the other party. Chenevert’s bill would change that to prohibit recovery of any amount by a party who’s 51% or more at fault. 
House Bill 450, by Rep. Michael Melerine, R-Shreveport, would end the Housley presumption, a standard of evidence explained in a 1991 Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that applies to auto accidents, medical malpractice and other injury lawsuits. In a nutshell, the Housley presumption says courts should assume a plaintiff’s injuries resulted from the accident in question if they were in good health beforehand.  
Lawmakers have tried repeatedly to revoke the presumption, only to see their attempts fail or vetoed. This year is expected to be different as Gov. Jeff Landry recently signaled support for the measure from Melerine, whose law firm handles insurance defense and other litigation. 
House Bill 436, by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, passed in a 69-17 vote. It would prohibit “unauthorized aliens” — defined in the measure as individuals illegally in the United States under federal immigration law — from receiving general damages stemming from auto accidents. General damages include compensation for pain and suffering, but the proposal would still allow recovery for “special damages,” such as medical expenses and property damage.
Firment, an insurance adjuster, said the purpose of his bill is to help address the state’s auto insurance crisis while discouraging illegal immigration. 
House Bill 443, by Rep. Chance Henry, R-Crowley, passed in a 70-22 vote. It would require plaintiffs to notify defendants of an intent to file a lawsuit within 10 days of retaining a lawyer. 
Currently, plaintiffs’ lawyers can gather evidence and prepare for a lawsuit for almost two full years before a defendant is even aware a suit is coming. Henry, an insurance agency owner, said his bill would give a defendant the same amount of time to prepare for a claim as a plaintiff.
House Bill 291, sponsored by Rep. Jay Gallé, R-Mandeville, won the most bipartisan support of the insurance bills, passing the chamber in a 90-5 vote. It would extend the filing deadline, called a “prescriptive period,” for wrongful death lawsuits from one year to two, aligning Louisiana with the deadline in most other states. 
Proponents of the bill have argued that a shorter prescriptive period attracts more tenuous lawsuits by essentially forcing people to quickly file claims so as to not lose their litigation rights. The proposal also complements a similar measure lawmakers approved last year to extend the deadline for filing personal injury claims.   
A measure that did not target litigation, House Bill 496, also gathered bipartisan support in a 86-3 vote. It would give policyholders a pass protecting them from any rate increases tied to a lapse in auto coverage. The bill would prohibit insurers from penalizing policyholders for a single instance of nonpayment during a five-year period.

Submitted on behalf of Stride, Inc. and its online education subsidiary, K12 Virtual Schools, the complaint alleges Hyatt sought a $235,000-per-year salary as Stride’s Vice President for Academic Innovation, while the company had an active contract with the school district—and when he was not hired for the position, Hyatt sought to terminate that contract.
K12 provides online education for the district’s Destinations Career Academy of New Mexico.

This story was originally published by New Mexico In Depth.

“Superintendent Hyatt is apparently knowingly and willfully abusing his public position, at the expense of ~4,200 New Mexico students” who are enrolled in online schooling, the complaint alleged.
In an email to New Mexico In Depth, Monday, Hyatt refuted the allegations, saying the company, not he, behaved in “illegal” and “unethical” ways, because of inadequate student-teacher ratios for their online courses.
“We have recently found out the illegal [and] unethical practices of Stride and how they are profiting and increasing revenue by breaking the law in our online program,” Hyatt wrote. “We notified them of their wrongdoing and had previously notified them to not break the law when it comes to students teacher ratios.”
The ethics complaint letter alleges that Hyatt potentially violated the New Mexico Government Conduct Act (GCA) and state procurement code. “The GCA has specific prohibitions against a public officer or employee seeking employment with a contractor who has a contract with the public officer or employee’s employer,” according to the complaint. “The Procurement Code similarly prohibits an employee who is participating directly or indirectly in the procurement process to become, or to be, while such an employee, the employee of any person or business contracting with the governmental body by whom the employee is employed.”
The complaint was filed by attorney Laura E. Sanchez of the law firm Rodey, Dickason, Sloan, Akin & Robb, P.A., in Albuquerque.
The New Mexico State Ethics Commission declined to comment on the complaint or its investigation plans. On Monday, Deputy Director Amelia Bierle told New Mexico In Depth in an email that the Commission does not comment on alleged ethics violations before investigations are concluded.
Gallup-McKinley signed an Educational Products & Services Contract with K12 in June 2020. Hyatt was district superintendent.
According to the company’s complaint letter, Hyatt applied for the company’s VP position on December 11, 2024 and was initially interviewed on Jan. 21, 2025.
On Feb. 21, the company’s senior vice president of schools, Adam Hawf, spoke with Hyatt by phone to let him know he had not been hired.
“Mr. Hawf called Superintendent Hyatt, as opposed to issuing him a formal letter, due to the sensitivity of the relationship and fear that Superintendent Hyatt would adversely affect the District’s relationship with the Contractor,” the complaint letter states.
In his email to New Mexico In Depth, Monday, Hyatt confirmed, “I applied for a job there in 2024.”
Less than a month after the call with Hawf, at a routine monthly meeting with the company on March 10, Hyatt’s demeanor had become “completely different than it had been in past meetings,” according to the complaint letter. “[T]he meeting was hostile […] instead of amicable and collaborative.”
On April 1, Hyatt sent a breach of contract and termination letter to the company, citing several alleged contract breaches, including inadequate student-teacher ratios, teacher licensure, and problems with student achievement in Destinations Career Academy students. Three days later, Gallup-McKinley issued a request for proposals to find a new contractor.
The termination letter violated a 45-day “cure” period for contractual disputes, the company contends. The complaint further alleges that Hyatt directed the district to issue the new request for proposals for virtual education services while Stride’s contract was still in effect, potentially violating its exclusivity provision.
Hyatt knew previously about student-teacher ratio concerns, according to the complaint letter.
“Superintendent Hyatt’s conduct after he was denied employment … shows that he is potentially abusing his authority, and not acting in the public interest,” the ethics complaint states. “He was aware of the alleged student-teacher ratios and the licensure issues prior to submitting his application for employment with the Contractor. He also served as a positive reference for the Contractor with the New Mexico PED [Public Education Department] on February 6, 2025 and for Ohio as recently as February 25, 2025, despite knowledge of the concerns he later raised in the letter to the Contractor on April 1, 2025.”
The firm submitted 18 supporting documents with the ethics complaint, including emails and correspondence, the termination letter, and the request for proposals.
The company has tried to address Hyatt’s concerns within the 45-day “cure period” set out in the contract but has been hindered by Gallup-McKinley since receiving the termination letter, according to the complaint. Examples include the district delaying teacher criminal history fingerprint clearances and refusing to sign off on teachers’ license extensions.
“Out of desperation they are attempting to deflect the harm they have done […] and are trying to create a narrative that I by myself am trying to break a contract for personal reasons,” Hyatt wrote in his email to the news organization. “Nothing could be further from the truth.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hyatt-1024x584.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

The suit argues that two companies, Express Scripts Inc. and Prime Therapeutics LLC, made an unlawful agreement to suppress reimbursement rates to independent pharmacies. According to a statement from Nessel’s office, this allowed the companies to make excessive profits and contributed to the closure of pharmacies in Michigan and across the state. 
Pharmacy benefit managers act as intermediaries between insurance providers, drug manufacturers and pharmacies, negotiating discounts and rebates with manufacturers and reimbursing pharmacies for the prescriptions they fill on behalf of the insurance company.
In December 2019, Express Scripts and Prime Therapeutics allegedly entered into an agreement for Prime Therapeutics to adopt Express Scripts’ lower reimbursement rates in exchange for accessing Express Scripts’ buying power and pharmacy network while paying Express Scripts administrative fees. Pharmacies outside this network allegedly received less money for filling prescriptions to the degree that some pharmacies paid more to dispense medication than they were reimbursed. 
Nessel argues the two companies’ agreement contributed to the creation of pharmacy deserts in half of Detroit’s neighborhoods and numerous communities throughout northern Michigan. Her suit aims to terminate the agreement, among other remedies.
“Michigan residents should not have to drive 45 minutes, or sometimes even farther, to pick up the insulin, heart medication, or antibiotics they need,” Nessel said. “Yet the unlawful, anticompetitive agreement that the lawsuit alleges has handed these PBMs unprecedented control over which pharmacies receive medication, how quickly residents get their prescriptions, and how much they’re forced to pay — crippling small, independent pharmacies and restricting access to lifesaving medications in the process.” 
“With this lawsuit, we are putting an end to these harmful practices to ensure Michiganders have reliable, affordable access to the medications they depend on,” Nessel said.

She maynot be getting any help from the state’s Child Care Assistance Program — at least not for the foreseeable future. The Mississippi Department of Human Services has put a cost-cutting hold on which families could apply.
Without it, Coleman, who works as a housekeeper, continues to rely on her relatives and friends to watch her kids, a 2-year-old and a 12-year-old, instead. She doesn’t know if she’s been rejected, but she is in a grey area. She applied in March, the month before the hold took place.
Beginning April 1, MDHS began limiting who could apply for new applications, redetermination applications, and “add a child” applications for child care certificates. 
Families who do not fit one of six priority categories (on or getting off Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, are homeless, have foster children, are teen parents, are deployed military or families with special needs) cannot apply for new certificates or have their certificates renewed. There were 36,186 children with child care certificates in late March, a week before the hold began. About 10,800 did not fit any of the six priority categories. 
Coleman is concerned that the lack of child care puts an extra strain on relatives and older children, creates a greater safety risk for young children, and makes it harder for communities to thrive.

““Our kids need the help, we need the help, because if you take the help from the American people, how do you expect us to thrive as Americans? How do you expect us to thrive as a state?” she said.
MDHS is trying to reduce the number of children receiving certificates to fewer than 27,000 to fit what the department can afford since COVID-19 relief funding dried up, with a target program cost of less than $12 million a month, said Mark Jones, chief communications officer for MDHS.
“We cannot accurately estimate how long the hold will remain in place, but we will be monitoring the situation very closely and will lift the hold as soon as we can,” he said.
MDHS will notify parents 60 days before their annual redetermination deadline. Parents who want to be notified can enter their email address in the application portal.
The Child Care Payment Program provides assistance to working parents and guardians for child care. The parent or guardian still has to pay the difference between what the program provides and the actual cost of tuition. They may also have to make a co-payment every month. 
According to Jones, Mississippi has dedicated approximately $379.9 million from various COVID-19 relief funding programs to child care since 2020. Mississippi currently spends 85% of its funds from the Child Care Development Fund on child care certificates, which was about $127 million in fiscal year 2024 and more than the federal minimum they’re required to spend. 
Mississippi also transfers 30% of its annual state funds from the Temporary Assistance For Needy Families program to child care. In 2024, that amounted to $25.9 million.
Carol Burnett, executive director of the Mississippi Low Income Child Care Initiative, speaks about a policy change by the Mississippi Department of Human Services, that removed a child support requirement for the Child Care Payment Program, at a news conference Monday, May 15, 2023, in Jackson, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)
Carol Burnett, executive director of the Mississippi Low Income Child Care Initiative, explained the financial impact for families: “The CCPP can reduce the cost of child care by as much as 80%. And so if a family is gonna have to pick up what the CCPP has offered, it’s gonna really increase the cost of child care for that family.”
MLICCI’s Employment Equity for Single Moms program helps single mothers in Mississippi access resources for child care and workforce development to help single moms find higher-paying work. 
A key part of the program is helping these mothers get on the Child Care Payment Program. MLICCI usually covers child care costs for its mothers while they wait to get assistance. Without the assistance, MLICCI can’t afford to pay for long-term child care.
“The biggest chunk of families on CCPP are low-income, single-mom-headed families who are working in jobs with low wages, and they’re not one of the six priorities,” said Burnett.
In addition to the financial impact on families, the hold on applications would disrupt education for children during a crucial period. Research has shown that children who attend quality early childhood education have better academic performance in elementary school.
“Without the CCPP vouchers, many families will not be able to afford child care, and so it’s likely that families’ child care arrangements will become unpredictable and piecemeal…and this uncertainty can cause children stress, which can hinder their development and growth,” explained Biz Harris, executive director of Mississippi Early Learning Alliance. 
Deloris Suel, who owns Prep Company Tutorial Schools in Jackson with her husband,said she thinks parents would be able to teach their children at home with the right training, but it would be a strain on top of their other responsibilities. 
“Child care today is not a babysitting service. There’s benchmarks and goals that we have to meet,” she said.
Prep Company Tutorial Schools serves 260 children, 61 of whom have child care certificates. Only two of their students fit among the six exception categories MDHS listed. 
Last week, a group of child care providers, parents and child care advocates held a press conference on the south steps of the Capitol, urging MDHS to lift the limits on new applications and redeterminations, communicate better with providers and families, and use the current and carry-over TANF funds to supplement the child care voucher program.
At the end of 2023, MDHS had over $156 million in unspent TANF funds, as other states do. Nationwide, states had unobligated TANF balances of nearly $8 billion in 2023. Spending this money on child care would be doable without legislative action, MLICCI said, and has already been done in other states. 
Burnett said she does not know why the state hasn’t used this method of funding. “I mean you would think that they would want to do that when they have the money rather than create this harm for so many families,” she said.
When asked why she thinks MDHS has been hesitant to use the available TANF funds, she said “I have two words: ‘Republican state.’ Because if we have other states joining hands to say, ‘Hey, we can pull this down from here.’ Why can’t Mississippi?”
When asked about using unspent TANF funds in this way, Jones responded, “MDHS is committed to following official federal guidance regarding conversion of TANF funds to CCPP. MDHS is resolved to utilize all available recurring revenue streams to support the CCPP and ensure the long-term viability of the program.”
Jones would not comment on why the department will not use left-over TANF funds.
Jones also stated, “MDHS has discussed the potential for a pause in CCPP certificates with the child care industry each month during the information sessions. The members of SECAC (State Early Childhood Advisory Council) were well aware of this potential pause as far back as 2023.”
Families can call the Child Care Payment Program call center at 800-877-7882 for questions or reach out to their nearest Resource & Referral Center for help.

Next time you’re around such politicians, especially if they are legislators or running for the Legislature, you should ask them a few questions.
Ask them why the Mississippi Legislature exempts itself from the open records and open meetings laws it levies on all other divisions of state government, and why legislative leaders have even fought in court to keep proceedings involving a majority of a legislative chamber secret from the public.
Ask them why you cannot get on your phone or computer and easily search for who funds their campaign and by how much. Then ask them why you could go to any surrounding state (and nearly all others across the country) and easily and quickly find such information.
Then, ask the same for why you cannot easily, or sometimes at all, see who buys them expensive dinners, trips or gifts to influence their voting, or why there aren’t any prohibitions or limits on this as there are in other states.
Ask their thoughts on “gift laws,” or prohibition or limits on campaign donors getting massive government contracts from the people to whom they donate.
Ask them if they believe all the folks who lobby lawmakers even bother to register as lobbyists or report what they do to influence them.
Ask them why Mississippi government, state to local, provides so few public records online, or why agencies charge so much when they do cough up records. 
Ask them why millions of dollars in out-of-state, secret-sourced “dark money” has been pouring into Mississippi elections in recent years, and what has been done to curb this.

Ask them to explain what Mississippi’s so-called “ethics laws” actually prohibit, what penalties they carry and what authority the so-called “Ethics Commission” has. Ask them how we compare here to other states, such as Alabama, where government ethics laws are actually enforced and their ethics agency has some authority.
READ MORE: Does Mississippi have any campaign finance rules?
For that matter, ask them who or what agency in Mississippi enforces campaign finance, ethics or lobbying laws.
Ask them why Mississippi’s attorney general recently decreed Mississippi’s campaign finance laws and limits to be so jacked up, convoluted and contradictory as to be unenforceable or un-prosecutable. Ask why the head of the state’s ethics agency has described Mississippi campaign finance laws as “a jigsaw puzzle that doesn’t fit.”

Ask them why, whenever even modest reforms such as campaign finance reporting requirements for politicians are proposed, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle act like their hair is on fire and line up to help kill it.
Ask them whether they believe Mississippi government is riddled with cronyism, nepotism or pay-to-play politics.

Then, finally, ask them whether they believe any of this might play a role in the historic and persistent government corruption that has often earned Mississippi the label of most corrupt state in the country.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 16:01:10+00:00,CT Mirror,"Data, disease, and disparity: CT’s public health emergency",William J. Bannon IV,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/data-disease-and-disparity-connecticuts-public-health-emergency/,"When public health funding disappears, infectious disease surveillance weakens, vaccine coverage declines, mental health crises deepen, and health disparities expand.","Connecticut is facing a silent unraveling of its public health infrastructure.
In March, more than $155 million in federal public health aid was abruptly cut, destabilizing the foundation of care that thousands of Connecticut residents rely on directly, and an estimated 1.8 million benefit from indirectly through statewide immunization programs and disease surveillance efforts.
The loss includes $118.8 million for epidemiology and lab capacity, $29.2 million for immunization activities, and $4.5 million targeted toward addressing health disparities. These numbers represent vaccines that won’t be administered, outbreaks that may go untracked, and critical programs facing long-term disruption or permanent loss.
As someone involved in clinical research and public health advocacy, I’ve come to understand that health systems are only as strong as the infrastructure behind them—from frontline providers to behind-the-scenes public health programs. These funding losses are compounded by workforce disruptions. With the Centers for Disease Control eliminating entire grant oversight teams, Connecticut agencies report being unable to contact federal administrators, submit deliverables, or ensure compliance. 
Public health is not self-sustaining; it depends on coordinated systems. When those systems break down, programs stall. Public safety is compromised.
The ripple effects are already reaching vulnerable communities. The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) lost $6 million that supported harm reduction centers, maternal substance use screening, and overdose prevention. Connecticut’s opioid overdose death rate rose by over 50% between 2018 and 2023, according to the DPH Opioid Surveillance Dashboard. Pulling support from overdose reversal efforts, such as naloxone distribution, will only accelerate this trajectory.
Climate-driven public health risks are also becoming more urgent. The Office of Climate and Health had been developing localized strategies to mitigate extreme heat and worsening air quality—both of which disproportionately affect older adults, low-income communities, and individuals with cardiovascular conditions. Research from the EPA and NIH links prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and heatwaves with increased rates of heart attacks, strokes, and hospitalizations. These initiatives were supported by the CDC’s Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) framework, a science-based strategy to help communities adapt to environmental threats. Those plans are now on hold, according to internal updates from the Connecticut BRACE program.  
Meanwhile, persistent health disparities continue to plague the state. A child born in northeast Hartford can expect to live 68.9 years on average. Just 50 miles away in Westport, life expectancy climbs to 89.1 years. These disparities are not the product of biology; they stem from unequal access to care, safe housing, clean air, and economic opportunity. These cuts risk deepening longstanding inequities and dismantling the very infrastructure designed to address them.
Workforce capacity has also been compromised. Connecticut has issued stop-work orders to 69 contractors and laid off over 50 long-term public health collaborators embedded in agencies like the Department of Public Health. These professionals provided vital services ranging from lab testing to emergency response coordination. Their expertise is not easily replaced.
But this isn’t just about federal decisions—it’s about how Connecticut chooses to respond. As of March 2025, the state’s budget reserve exceeded $4.1 billion and has recorded average annual surpluses of $1.8 billion over the past seven years. These circumstances demand serious consideration of a dedicated Health Infrastructure Stabilization Fund to protect the systems we rely on most. Strategic use of these reserves could provide a critical safeguard.
Programs with demonstrated success should be prioritized. Research from the Connecticut Health Foundation shows that every $1 invested in community-based public health programs returns $14 in reduced emergency visits, lower chronic disease costs, and improved workforce productivity.. Mobile harm reduction services, air quality monitoring, and neighborhood-based health equity partnerships all fit this evidence-based model.
The health of our state is a measurable, observable reality. Reductions in funding are historically associated with increased disease burden and preventable outcomes. When preventive systems disappear, we spend more on crisis care that could have been avoided. The data tells the story long before the headlines do. What matters now is whether we choose to act.
What can Connecticut citizens do? Start with advocacy. Contact state legislators and demand immediate action to replace lost federal funds and stabilize essential services. Support local public health efforts. Donate to health equity organizations. Amplify the science on social media and in your communities. This is not only a test of policy—but of principle. What we choose to fund today will shape the health of our communities tomorrow.
When public health funding disappears, infectious disease surveillance weakens, vaccine coverage declines, mental health crises deepen, and health disparities expand. The termination of these federal grants was abrupt —but our response doesn’t have to be. If Connecticut is serious about protecting its residents, especially those most at risk, then we must move beyond concern and act now.
Good governance requires listening to the data. The science is unambiguous. Economic modeling supports intervention. The ethical obligation is no less clear. Delay only deepens the damage.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 16:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Plan to heat state buildings with natural gas system riles advocates,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/ct-state-buildings-natural-gas-heating/,The plan would upgrade a facility that supplies heating and cooling to an underground network of pipes connected to 15 buildings in Hartford.,"Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration plans to invest in a new gas heating system for state office buildings in downtown Hartford, but the decision has fueled backlash from state and local activists who say it will spew pollution into surrounding neighborhoods and undermine the governor’s own climate goals.
The administration’s plan would upgrade a facility that supplies heating and cooling to an underground network of pipes connected to 15 buildings in downtown Hartford known as the Capitol Area System.
The system — also called the “loop” — includes several government buildings including the Armory, the Supreme Court Building and the Legislative Office Building, as well as private ones like the Bushnell Theater. (The Capitol itself relies on a separate system to heat and cool the 146-year-old building.)
Hot air and water, as well as steam, is produced at the CAS plant several blocks west of the Capitol, which officials say is in desperate need of renovations — particularly after a 2021 explosion damaged the plant’s pump house and necessitated the installation of temporary boilers.
Environmental and climate activists seized upon the project, arguing that it offered the Lamont administration an opportunity to de-carbonize more than a dozen buildings at once through the installation of electric boilers or a geothermal heating and cooling system. 
But earlier this year the Department of Administrative Services announced that it was opting to move forward with a “hybrid” approach, utilizing both heat pumps and newer natural gas boilers to power the system. The upgrade is estimated to cost roughly $42 million and take several years to complete.
The decision infuriated advocates, who accused Lamont of breaking his pledge to reduce the use of fossil fuels to heat and cool state buildings.
“He’s going against his own word,” said Alycia Jenkins, a Sierra Club organizer from Hartford. “It falls in line with what we see happening across this country, people choosing fossil fuels, people choosing natural gas.”
Jenkins and other opponents of the state’s plans say they want a new study to examine the feasibility of turning the CAS into a geothermal system, which would harness ambient temperatures from deep underground that can provide heat in the winter and cooling during the summer.
Similar systems are being piloted nearby in Framingham, Mass., and — dependent on federal funding — at New Haven’s Union Station. 
Leigh Appleby, a spokesman for DAS, said the state has not entirely given up on potentially cleaner options for the future of the facility. In an email last week, he said that the next step in the process would be to hire an engineering consultant to study the hybrid approach, along with other “viable alternatives” that could reduce costs or carbon emissions.
“We recognize that the selected option of heat pumps and natural gas condensing boilers is not zero emissions, as many of the comments advocated,” Appleby said. “However, other factors, most notably the uncertainty surrounding the long-term location of the CAS facility due to the anticipated realignment of I-84, prevented the implementation of more costly and extensive zero-emission scenarios. During the design development process, we will seek additional opportunities to reduce emissions.” 
When asked about the project during an event commemorating Earth Day last week, Lamont said he was concerned about the cost of updating the facility along with the environmental impacts.
“We’re going to look at everything, and we’re also going to let the taxpayers know what the relative costs of everything are,” Lamont said. “I think affordability has got to be on the table right alongside what we’re celebrating here on Earth Day.”
According to a decarbonization study commissioned by DAS in 2023, the hybrid approach selected by the administration would produce about 197,668 fewer metric tons of carbon dioxide over the next three decades — the equivalent of driving nearly 50,000 cars for a year — compared to it’s current operations.
Still, the study found that utilizing a geothermal system or a combination of all-electric boilers and heat pumps could reduce emissions by an additional 80% or more.
The total cost to build the new system — including the $42 million in construction costs — and operate it for for the next three decades using the hybrid approach was roughly $164 million, according to the study. That was nearly half the cost of using all-electric boilers and about one-third less than the cost of geothermal.
Opponents, however, argue that the volatile price of natural gas as well as the future health care costs for people living in the vicinity of the plant could put the plant’s price tag much higher.
“The cost is not just the cost of rebuilding this plant, it’s maintaining this plant for 30 to 35 years, because that’s how long it’s going to be there, [releasing] all kinds of toxic pollutants into the air and creating all kinds of asthma and respiratory conditions,” said Cynthia Jennings, a former Hartford councilwoman who is involved with local efforts to oppose the state’s plans.
Jenkins, the Sierra Club organizer, pointed to data showing that Hartford has among the highest asthma rates of any city in the nation. While attending Trinity College, Jenkins said she lived in the Frog Hollow neighborhood abutting the CAS plant, and later developed bronchitis as an adult.
“We’re concerned about the air pollution, we’re concerned about asthma rates, and we’re also concerned about jobs,” Jenkins said.
The state’s study — conducted by Veolia, a French infrastructure management company — attempted to calculate the so-called “social” costs of carbon pollution, such as human health impacts, property damage from floods and storms, and changes in agricultural productivity. The study concluded that they did not outweigh the additional expenses of carbon-free options.
Asked for comment on the project this week, a spokesman for Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam said it was a “state matter” and deferred further requests to the governor’s office. 
The CAS plant was originally constructed in 1988 as a cogeneration plant producing both electricity as well as steam that was used to heat and cool buildings connected to the loop. At the time, it was the second-largest source of air pollution in the city of Hartford, according to the Sierra Club. 
The previous owners of the plant, Capitol District Energy Center Cogeneration Associates Property Co., shuttered its gas-powered electric turbines in 2021, several months before the pump room explosion, and sold the facility to the state the next year for $7.3 million.
In the public notice of its decision to adopt the hybrid power plan, DAS said the decommissioning of the plant’s power-generation capabilities will reduced annual greenhouse gas emissions by more than two-thirds, and that it is no longer considered a major source of air pollution as defined by the federal Clean Air Act. The agency added that its review of the project determined it will not result in “significant environmental impacts,” and thus does not require a separate environmental impact study.
During a public comment period, officials at Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection submitted several recommendations regarding applicable environmental laws and regulations during construction, but the agency did not signal any overall objections to the project. A DEEP spokesman deferred to DAS for comment on the project. 
Appleby, the DAS spokesman, said work is expected to begin this summer to demolish and remove old, unused equipment from the site including wiring, generators, turbines, chilling equipment and a boiler. That work is intended to make space for the installation of new equipment.
Following the completion of the engineering study and design work, Appleby said construction will begin around December 2027 assuming funding for the project is in place. Work is expected to be completed sometime in 2029. 
Lamont’s budget proposal for the upcoming year called for an additional $16 million in capital expenses for the CAS project, bringing the total available funding through bonds to $35 million.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA Kennesaw State University faculty advisory panel wants to team up with other universities to fight what some call inappropriate political influence from the Trump administration and state leaders.
The university’s faculty Senate voted 30-7 Monday on a resolution to establish a mutual defense compact. Kennesaw students have expressed concerns over the university’s plans to shut down student resource centers that help members of minority groups, apparently as part of a national push against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI.
The Trump administration has engaged in a public pressure campaign against elite college campuses over what the president views as left-wing indoctrination as well as student protests over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. State lawmakers are also targeting DEI, including through a bill that would ban programs or activities that promote diversity, equity and inclusion at all grade levels. That bill stalled this year, but will still be active when next year’s session begins in January.
Matthew Boedy, president of the Georgia chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said the University System of Georgia is targeting programs associated with DEI.
“That includes any scholarship that is funded by any third party, and then also multicultural offices, and the decades-long African-American Male Initiative, which is a USG thing, every campus version of that is being shut down, and this is all supposed to happen by the end of the academic year or the end of the fiscal year, and they do say that faculty who may have been a part of that or working those things will be reassigned, but there’s no guarantee that staff would be reassigned. That has been the USG directive to all schools here in the last two weeks or so.”
According to the KSU faculty Senate’s resolution, faculty senates from institutions across the country have recommended joining such a compact, including Rutgers University, Indiana University, the University of Nebraska, Michigan State University, Yale and UMass Amhurst.
Member institutions would “commit meaningful support—financial, legal, organizational, and/or strategic—to a shared or distributed defense infrastructure designed to respond immediately and collectively to attacks by the governmental actors on any member institution,” according to the resolution.
The KSU faculty Senate is an advisory board to the university’s president, Kathy Schwaig, and would need her approval to actually join.
Boedy didn’t mince words on the likelihood of that happening.
“This is a symbolic move,” he said. “The faculty Senate is asking the university administration to participate in legal filings, amicus briefs, defending academic freedom, using state funds, their institutional funds, to do this. Whether or not these presidents will actually do this is not an open question – they’re not going to do this, at least in the USG. So I would say it’s a symbolic move, but it is also a very powerful, powerful symbolic move for the Senate to say, ‘You’re not doing this, and you need to do this.’”
Boedy said he expects other university faculties across the nation to take similar actions, though he’s not aware of any others in Georgia with concrete plans.
“To be honest with you, part of the debate was what are the consequences for signing on to this? Would there be political or state consequences for signing on to this?” he said. “That’s a real concern for many faculty, even though the vote at Kennesaw was overwhelming, that was a concern.”
The Recorder has reached out to Kennesaw State and USG for comment. Check back for updates and read the resolution below.

The Ohio Supreme Court is keeping the ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth as the case goes through litigation.
In March, the 10th District Court of Appeals partially blocked the state from enforcing House Bill 68, a ban on gender-affirming care for LGBTQ+ youth, allowing doctors to continue prescribing puberty blockers and hormone therapy.
Attorney General Dave Yost filed a motion with the high court to stay the law, or pause changes, until a full review by the justices. This was granted Tuesday.
H.B. 68 went into effect in 2024. The controversial legislation prevented LGBTQ+ minors from accessing care such as hormone blockers, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and some mental health services.
“There is no way I’ll stop fighting to protect these unprotected children,” Yost said, in part, in a statement from the March ruling.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe law has been in court for months now, with the ACLU of Ohio arguing that it is unconstitutional and goes against parental rights and the right to bodily autonomy.
“It is a terrible shame that the Supreme Court of Ohio is permitting the state to evade compliance with the Ohio Constitution. Our clients have suffered tangible and irreparable harm during the eight months that H.B. 68 has been in place, including being denied essential health care in their home state,” Freda Levenson, ACLU legal director, said. “The Court of Appeals was correct that H.B. 68 violates at least two separate provisions of the Ohio Constitution. We will continue to fight this extreme ban as the case goes ahead before the Supreme Court of Ohio.”
The law also prohibits trans athletes from participating in middle, high school or college athletics on teams that align with their identity.
In July 2024, parents and doctors testified to prevent the state from enforcing the ban, citing that the ban would “deny basic human rights.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 15:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Records restored for some CT international students, but many remain in legal limbo",Eddy Martinez | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/ct-international-students-records-restored/,Several international students in CT can now resume their employment and studies after their records were restored in a federal database.,"Several international students in Connecticut can now resume their employment and studies after their records were restored in a federal database, according to the University of Connecticut.
“We have learned that all of the impacted students at UConn have now had their SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Program) records restored by the federal government, meaning absent some other unexpected change, they should be able to resume their studies and work at UConn uninterrupted,” UConn officials said in a statement.
This comes after the federal government announced Friday it would move to restore the statuses of many international students who previously had their records eliminated in recent weeks.
But the update doesn’t mean the federal government will abandon attempts at revoking visas, according to a Georgia attorney representing four Connecticut students who are a part of a nationwide lawsuit in a federal district court in Georgia.
Their attorney, Charles Kuck, previously obtained a temporary restraining order against the government to restore his clients’ statuses before the government made their announcement last Friday. But Kuck emphasized the government is simply buying time to resume their efforts.
“What ICE said was that they were temporarily restoring, as of that date, the SEVIS access, leaving students with a large gap of unlawful status,” Kuck said. “And they also indicated they were drafting new rules so they could reinstate the revocation.”
Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary, did not reveal how many foreign students in Connecticut are affected by the federal government’s abrupt reversal on Friday. All the federal government did, she said, was to restore the records for certain foreign students.
“What we did is restore SEVIS access for people who had not had their visa revoked,” McLaughlin said.
UConn spokesperson Stephanie Reitz said in a statement the restoration of those records is distinct from restoring a previously revoked student visa.
“When a person’s SEVIS record is deleted, they are unable to prove their visa status for purposes of travel, work, etc., even if the visa has not been revoked,” Reitz said.
Kuck said he will file a class action lawsuit in response to what he said is an anticipated move by the federal government to impose harsher rules for foreign students.
According to Reitz, none of the students at UConn had their visas revoked by the federal government, although according to her, 300 international students nationwide, have. McLaughlin said the federal government has not reversed their decision on a single visa revocation.
Kuck said he is also awaiting a decision in Georgia on whether his clients can have their statuses restored for the duration of the lawsuit. A decision is expected this week.

DemasA federal judge in Detroit has ended litigation against one of the companies that consulted with the city of Flint when lead contamination led to a drinking water crisis 10 years ago. 
U.S. District Judge Judith Levy entered the final judgment Monday for the $53 million settlement reached in February in a lawsuit brought by the state of Michigan and approximately 26,000 individuals claiming Veolia North America, or VNA, contributed to the Flint Water Crisis by failing to properly identify corrosion control treatment issues.
It was alleged that the Boston-based company did not do enough to get Flint to treat its water so that it would be less corrosive inside the city’s lead pipes. That followed the 2014 switch from Lake Huron to the Flint River as the city’s water source, a decision made by emergency managers appointed by then-Gov. Rick Snyder as a cost-saving move. 
VNA claimed it had only been hired to do a one-week assessment on carcinogens, not specifically lead content, and that it has made recommendations to the city about corrosion control.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The $53 million agreed to in the settlement will be distributed among the plaintiffs who were directly impacted by the lead-tainted water, including a significant number of children.  
With the settlement, the state will also dismiss a separate lawsuit against VNA.
The company, in a statement, said the settlement was not an admission of guilt and argued that public officials were to blame for the crisis.
“VNA stands behind its good work in Flint. The only jury who had to consider the facts and hear the truth did not find any evidence to say otherwise” referencing a nearly six-month long trial in 2022, which ended in a mistrial.
“As the facts of the 2022 trial clearly demonstrate, the Flint water crisis was caused by government officials. It is a disgrace that nearly a decade plus since the crisis was set in motion, still no person who was actually responsible has been held accountable,” said VNA’s release. 
Snyder, a Republican who left office in 2019, and eight other high-level officials, were charged in January 2021 in connection with the water crisis.  However, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that a judge lacked the authority to issue the indictments, and all of the charges were later dismissed.  
However, the crisis did result in the largest civil settlement in Michigan history. 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced in March 2023 a settlement totaling about $626.25 million had been formally approved, with the state ordered to pay $600 million, the city of Flint $20 million, the McLaren Regional Medical Center $5 million and $1.25 million from Rowe Professional Services.
Nessel said the settlement with VNA had finally closed out a chapter for Flint residents. 
“While no amount of money can fully repair the damage caused to the Flint community, these funds will provide additional resources to those directly impacted, especially Flint children, by this preventable crisis,” Nessel said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC08883-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Republican State Auditor Allison Ball is calling five open records requests from a Kentucky Democratic Party official “an attempt to intimidate me” from investigating how the state’s Office of Medical Cannabis processed license applications. 
Ball, who has previously clashed with the Beshear administration over her office’s investigations, issued a statement Monday saying after she announced the investigation into OMC earlier this month Kentucky Democrats “sent five Open Records Act requests to my office in what can only be described as an attempt to intimidate me from continuing the investigation.” However, the Kentucky Democratic Party denied that the requests were related to Ball’s investigation. 
Ball said a Finance and Administration Cabinet official sent similar open records requests after her office announced investigations into the Cabinet for Health and Family Services in recent months. 
“It is a shame that parties would seek to weaponize the Open Records Act, an important transparency tool, as a political weapon,” Ball said. “Because I believe in the importance of transparency, I have responded to the KDP’s requests in full, just as I did to the Finance Cabinet requests.  
“Kentucky should rest assured that these intimidation tactics will not work. I will continue to carry out the job that Kentuckians elected me to do.”
Under the Kentucky Open Records Act, members of the public may request records from public agencies within the state. 
Kentucky Democratic Party spokesperson Nat Turner said in a statement to the Kentucky Lantern that Ball “is trying to manufacture partisan drama, and what she is alleging is not true.” 
“The requests in question were not related to her audit; they were for records related to grievances, personal appeals, travel records and her use of taxpayer money to attend a religious leadership conference,” Turner said. “Transparency is important and Auditor Ball has a responsibility to be accountable to Kentuckians.”
Joy Markland, a spokesperson for Ball, shared copies of the requests made by the Democrats and responses of the auditor’s office. The records match the requests Turner described. In a search for the records, the auditor’s office found no records of grievances from staff members filed this year and provided records related to travel, personal appeals and contracts entered by the office. 
Amye Bensenhaver, a retired Kentucky assistant attorney general and co-founder and co-director of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition, said “all is fair in love and open records.” The state law is “intended to be almost blind to who is asking and why they’re asking,” with some limitations on requests made for commercial reasons, she added. 
Ball’s accusation against the state Democratic party is also “weaponizing the law,” Bensenhaver said. 
“Ultimately, you could be a thin-skinned public official who shows resistance or expresses outrage when your office is expected to produce records, but it tends to undermine your credibility when you’re seeking records from another public agency,” Bensenhaver said. 
Some political staffers look for information to use in campaign messaging through open record requests. Ahead of the 2023 governor’s race, the office of then Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron ruled Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration violated the Kentucky Open Records Act when denying part of a request from the Republican Party of Kentucky.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The federal government has restored the student record of a doctoral candidate from India at South Dakota Mines in Rapid City, but the fight over her student visa continues. 
The record restoration from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement means Priya Saxena could collect her degree at graduation on May 10.
But the revocation of her student visa means she could still be subject to deportation before her visa was originally scheduled to expire in February 2027. If deported, she would also lose the opportunity to apply for an extension to remain in the country after graduation and do work related to her degree.
The news of her record restoration came by way of a motion filed by ICE attorneys in Saxena’s federal lawsuit against ICE and the federal Homeland Security secretary, former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. 
A dozen international students report visa cancellations in South Dakota

A little more than a week ago, U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier ordered the agency to restore Saxena’s student record.
The U.S. State Department issues and manages visas, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement maintains the student record system used by schools across the country to verify and manage international student eligibility. 
ICE terminated more than 1,000 international student records in that system in recent weeks, but reversed course over the weekend. The decision impacted cases across the country similar to Saxena’s.
In South Dakota, a dozen international student visas were impacted by the recent moves. Saxena’s name is the only one that’s appeared in the public sphere, thanks to her lawsuit.
The visa revocation for Saxena came after a “criminal records check,” according to documents filed in her lawsuit. Her only criminal conviction came in 2021, for the misdemeanor of failure to move over for flashing yellow lights.
In its filing Monday night in her case, ICE called Judge Schreier’s order to restore Saxena’s student record “moot,” because the agency had moved to restore terminated international student records across the U.S.
Saxena has asked for a preliminary injunction that would prevent deportation until the lawsuit is resolved. The federal government says a preliminary injunction is a bridge too far, arguing that district court judges don’t have the authority to interfere with visa status determinations. 
A hearing in the matter is set for May 13.

The signings fell on the eve of Trump’s first 100 days of his second term, during which his administration has enacted an immigration crackdown that has led to clashes with the judiciary branch and cities that do not coordinate with federal immigration authorities, often referred to as “sanctuary cities.”
“Some State and local officials nevertheless continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws,” according to the executive order regarding sanctuary cities. “This is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government’s obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States.”
The order directs the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to publicly list local jurisdictions that limit cooperation with immigration officials, but do not stop immigration enforcement.
Jurisdictions on the list will then be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget to “identify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as appropriate.”
This is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. 
The Justice Department recently filed a lawsuit against the city of Rochester, New York, over its immigration policies after local law enforcement did not assist federal immigration officials in an arrest. The Trump administration argued those ordinances in Rochester were impeding federal immigration enforcement.
The president also signed an executive order in January that threatened to withhold federal funding from states and local governments that refused to aid in federal immigration enforcement activities. A federal judge in San Francisco last week blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from 16 so-called sanctuary cities.
Republicans have also scrutinized those policies, including during a six-hour hearing of the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that included grilling mayors from Boston, Chicago and Denver, on their cities’ immigration policies. 
The executive order also aims to curb any federal benefits that may extend to people without permanent legal status.
That executive order directed DOJ and DHS to “take appropriate action to stop the enforcement of State and local laws” that allow for students without proper legal authorization to receive in-state tuition, which would include those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.
Last week, administration officials cheered the FBI arrest of a Wisconsin judge who they say helped an immigrant in the country without legal authorization escape detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The arrest followed the third appearance by ICE officers seeking to make arrests at the Milwaukee County Courthouse, a practice some experts believe hinders local law enforcement.
Law enforcement resources
A second executive order Trump signed Monday provides legal resources for law enforcement officials “who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law.”
The order also directs coordination among the departments of Justice, Defense and Homeland Security to “increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement.” 
Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the executive order relating to law enforcement will “strengthen and unleash America’s law enforcement to pursue criminals and protect innocent citizens.”

It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

“These cuts represent some of the best options of bad options,” said Kyle Murray, the Massachusetts program director at the Acadia Center about the new compliance plan for Mass Save, which reduces the budget for heat pump incentives and program to help residents use one vendor for energy efficiency upgrades. 
The post Utility companies target heat pump ince[...]","After state officials reduced Mass Save’s proposed budget by $500 million in February, the utility companies that run the energy efficiency program have proposed a new pared down compliance plan with the largest cuts coming to incentives for heat pumps and a program that provides a one-stop shop for residents looking to weatherize and invest in electrification upgrades.  Six utility companies, including Eversource and National Grid, run the Mass Save program with the guidance of the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council. The utility companies presented their compliance plan with cuts on Monday to the council.  The new plan cuts $220 million from heat pump rebates and a loan program that offers zero percent financing for qualifying energy-efficiency upgrades that include heat pump projects for residents. The plan also cuts $207 million from a “residential turnkey” program which is a streamlined solution that coordinates weatherization, barrier mitigation, and electrification upgrade projects through a single vendor that manages all steps of the process.  There are also smaller cuts of $43 million to the sales, technical assistance, and training budget, $12 million to the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center for economic development for green jobs, and $2 million to a program offering that translates program materials into different languages. Generally, the cuts come from programs targeted towards residents in market-rate housing and to a lesser degree moderate income housing. The Department of Public Utilities directed the utility companies not to cut funding from programs targeted towards lower-income residents.   “It has been a trying and challenging time going back and fundamentally revisiting a lot of what we planned over the last year and a half,” said Brian Greenfield, a supervisor of energy efficiency regulatory and planning at Eversource, who presented the plan to the council. “Faced with this order and dissecting what was in the plan and where we could make adjustments to comply with the required $500 million reduction to the residential budgets, the [utility companies] prioritized maintaining our program design and we are eager to get into and focus on implementing these plans over the course of the term.” The council voted to support the compliance plan. The utility companies will submit the revised compliance filing to the DPU for approval by April 30. Mass Save estimates it has provided $31 billion in total energy cost savings since it launched in 2013. The initial proposed budget projected that the program would save another $13.7 billion between 2025 and 2027. According to Greenfield, the cuts to the program will result in an 11 percent decrease in the total benefits in the next three years, bringing the total benefits down to $12.2 billion. “These cuts represent some of the best options of bad options,” said Kyle Murray, a member of the council and the Massachusetts program director at the Acadia Center, a non-profit research and advocacy organization dedicated to combating climate change.  The Mass Save program – which helps homes and businesses become more energy efficient and reduces greenhouse gas emissions – is funded through a surcharge on electricity and gas bills. After gas bills spiked across the state due to an unusually cold winter and the increase in the Mass Save surcharge, the DPU decreased the budget for the program from the proposed $5 million to $4.5 million. The DPU directed that the cut come from programming for the residential sector.  Environmentalist advocates including Murray called the move “short-sighted,” saying that the cut will result in increased costs for residents in the long run.  The energy efficiency program is key to the state’s decarbonization efforts. Massachusetts aims to convert 500,000 households to heat pumps by 2030, but even that target – which was set before Mass Save saw its budget pared back – would fall short of what the state needs to do to meet its climate goals of being carbon neutral by 2050.  The post Utility companies target heat pump incentives for cuts to pare back Mass Save budget appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Worcester_Housing_Triple_Three_Decker_Homes.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 11:05:03.578804

The post M[...]","PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP raked in nearly $4.1 million for his 2025 inauguration from donors and businesses with Massachusetts addresses, just under two percent of the total $239 million raised for the parties tied to his swearing-in for a second term in January. Trump’s inaugural committee reported the names and figures earlier this month in a filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which showed the president beating the previous record he set: $107 million for his first inauguration. Presidential inaugurations feature the oath of office as well as official and unofficial balls or galas in Washington, D.C., offering a way for companies and individuals to ingratiate themselves with a new administration. Large corporations made appearances on the list, including e-commerce giant Amazon and Facebook owner Meta, which each gave $1 million. The largest donation, coming in at $5 million, was from Pilgrim’s Pride, a poultry producer based in Colorado. Cryptocurrency interests also donated, with Ripple Labs donating $4.9 million. The 21 Massachusetts donors and businesses, with donations totaling roughly $4.1 million, fell below their counterparts in other states, such as Pennsylvania ($8.6 million) and Michigan ($6.4 million). Both were swing states in 2024, while Massachusetts has remained a Democratic stronghold, with Ronald Reagan the last Republican to win the Bay State in 1984. CommonWealth Beacon reviewed the Trump inauguration fundraising committee’s filing with the Federal Election Commission, which included donors and companies listing Massachusetts addresses. One of the largest donors in the state was a company tied to billionaire and car dealership magnate Ernie Boch Jr. The company, which is called Boston Port Service and shares an address with his nonprofit charity Music Drives Us, donated $1 million. Boch, who previously hosted a fundraiser for Trump in 2015, was unreachable for comment. DraftKings, the Boston-based gambling company with a focus on sports betting, gave $502,000, while FanDuel, its New York-based rival, gave $482,000. Another $500,000 came from GE Vernova, a Cambridge-based energy technology company working in the renewable power sector. The company, whose wind power division is grappling with a White House that has sought to put a stop to new wind turbine projects, spun off from the conglomerate General Electric in 2024. (CommonWealth Beacon reached out to DraftKings and GE Vernova for comment but did not hear back.) Jessica Beeson Tocco, the CEO of A10 Associates, which bills itself as the country’s “largest woman-owned bipartisan lobbying firm,” personally donated $101,652 to the Trump inauguration committee and then an additional $50,000 through her Malden-based company. (The company also hosted a cocktail reception at the Waldorf Astoria the weekend before the inauguration, according to Politico.) One of her clients, Quantum Computing Inc. CEO William McGann, also donated $101,652. He is retiring from the technology company in May and is listed as having an East Falmouth address on the FEC’s records.  Reached for comment, Tocco stressed that her firm’s donations go to top elected officials in both parties, with contributions flowing to prominent Massachusetts Democrats like US Sen. Ed Markey, Gov. Maura Healey, and Congresswoman Lori Trahan. A potential Healey rival for the corner office in the State House, Michael Minogue, donated $250,000 to the Trump inauguration committee. Minogue, who now has his own consulting firm after serving as president and CEO of medical technology company Abiomed, has previously donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican National Committee and the state GOP. He also gave several thousand dollars to former Gov. Charlie Baker and Josh Kraft, who is looking to unseat Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, according to publicly available campaign finance records. Others gave smaller amounts. Sriprakash Kothari, an accounting professor at MIT and a Lexington resident who regularly donates to the state GOP, gave $2,500 to the Trump inauguration committee. Kothari, who worked as the chief economist for the US Securities and Exchange Commission during the first Trump administration, declined to comment about the donation. Some of the donors, like the company tied to Boch, had to be tracked through corporate documents on file with the Massachusetts secretary of state’s office. For example, Randolph-based GGBF Inc. donated $50,000 to the Trump inauguration committee, according to the FEC filing. Documents on file with the state show the company shares the same address and same president as NEI General Contracting, Josef Rettman. Rettman has mostly donated to Democrats at the state and local level, and a mix at the federal level, including US Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Trump White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s 2022 congressional campaign in New Hampshire. The list of donors to the inauguration committee did not include the names of some major donors who had previously contributed to the first Trump presidential campaign or the first inauguration in 2017. Jim Davis, the chairman of shoemaker New Balance, donated nearly $400,000 to support Trump’s 2016 campaign. The Kraft Group, tied to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, didn’t donate to the 2025 inauguration after donating $1 million for the 2017 inauguration. Ahead of the 2024 election, Kraft distanced himself from Trump, saying he was “very upset” by the insurrection attempt to keep Trump in office on January 6, 2021. Kraft has since reportedly helped a law firm, Paul Weiss, broker a peace deal with Trump, who has targeted lawyers through executive orders. “I made a strong donation to his [2017] inauguration,” Kraft said during an appearance on a radio show last October. “I couldn’t believe it, it was like having someone who was a drunk fraternity brother become president of the United States.” Massachusetts donors to Trump inauguration

David Cortese, the idea of gaining Republican support for a bill to provide cash to certain residents would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.
But his proposed legislation to offer $1,000 per month to homeless youth has so far received bipartisan support in the state Senate.
“It’s being embraced,” said Cortese. “This was not even considered possible five years ago.”
Cortese is among more than 20 Democratic lawmakers from 17 states launching Legislators for a Guaranteed Income on Tuesday to advocate for programs that provide direct, regular cash payments to lower-income residents to help alleviate poverty. They join a network of more than 245 mayors and county officials who have pursued dozens of basic income pilot projects across the country.
The lawmakers want to see states play a larger role in guaranteed income programs, which aim to help residents in need by handing out no-strings-attached cash.
Red states fight growing efforts to give ‘basic income’ cash to residents

The concept of basic income programs took off following a 2019 experiment in Stockton, California. There, 125 individuals received $500 per month for two years, which researchers found improved their financial stability and health.
Michael Tubbs, the former Democratic mayor of Stockton and current executive chairman of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, said these kinds of efforts are more important now as economic uncertainty and high prices squeeze the most vulnerable people.
“The work around guaranteed income is moving from cities and counties to states,” he said. “We’re going to be organizing state officials across the country who see what we all see: that affordability is an issue, that the Trump tariffs and gross mismanagement of the economy has made the problem even worse.”
While the concept has gained traction across the country, Republican state lawmakers have pushed bills to ban basic income programs, arguing they disincentivize work.
Last year, then-state Sen. John Wiik sponsored successful legislation banning South Dakota localities from launching basic income programs. At the time, the Republican said he was worried about people growing dependent upon the government.
“So, if you get people addicted to just getting a check from the government, it’s going to be really hard to take that away,” he told Stateline.
Legislators for a Guaranteed Income says its 23 members have so far introduced 25 bills across 11 states.










The work around guaranteed income is moving from cities and counties to states.

Those include Cortese’s proposed legislation in California to create a new program to help homeless youth transition out of high school.
Eligible students would receive four monthly payments of $1,000 each beginning in May. That bill, expected to cost $40 million to $50 million, has passed through two state Senate committees.
Cortese previously advocated for a 2023 California program that was the nation’s first state-funded pilot of a basic income program targeting former foster youth. He pointed to research showing basic income programs supplement, rather than replace, the need for work. And he said growing these programs can eventually reduce costs for other social safety net programs.
“I’m so pleased to see the proliferation that we’ve seen so far,” he said. “I think that it will become ubiquitous as a way of doing things and that’s going to outlast me and my career.”
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

In Pennsylvania, Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta said he’s still exploring details on legislation for a basic income program there.
He said pilot projects across the country have proven that people pay rent, buy groceries and invest in small businesses when they have more financial freedom.
“So, this isn’t really some big experiment,” he said. “It is a proven way to reduce poverty, improve health care, boost our local economies and really get a real return on that investment.”
Kenyatta said so-called trickle-down policies that aim to boost business interests and high earners have failed many ordinary people.
“But basic income really flips that equation on its head,” he said. “It’s not about charity. It’s about power, and about giving people the power and the resources to breathe.”

(Cade Rothenberger for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Fear that federal funding cuts will mean loved ones won’t receive nutritional food and safety checks through Meals on Wheels is driving an increase of calls to agencies across Kansas.
“It’s scary,” said Laurel Alkire, executive director of Senior Services Inc. of Wichita. “I’ve had a lot of families call me about their mom or dad. We’re trying to not overreact, but it’s very concerning.”
The fear is generated by potential federal funding cuts from multiple sources that could affect Meals on Wheels budgets nationwide, said Josh Protas, an advocate at the organization’s national office, Meals on Wheels America. 
“I think there’s a lot of confusion and a lot of anxiety that we’re hearing from across our network that is in response to multiple threats that are happening all at once,” he said.
Programs facing federal cuts include those funded by Health and Human Services, which has faced “massive” cuts of budget and personnel, Protas said. A leaked budget document signaled intentions to cut and split apart some programs that serve older adults. 
Also of concern is the ongoing budget reconciliation process, which among other things may include elimination of social services block grants and cuts to the Older Americans Act, he said. 
“Social Services Block Grants are a critical source of funding for many Meals on Wheels programs to help fill in the gaps where there are shortfalls in other funding sources,” Protas said. 
Proposed cuts to Medicaid also could harm Meals on Wheels budgets because those funds sometimes offer reimbursements, he said. 
Isys Schmitt, director of nutrition at the Northwest Kansas Area Agency on Aging, said her agency serves 18 counties at 28 sites in northwest Kansas. 
“I do hear the concerns from participants,” she said. “I think it’s more they hear these things on the news, and they automatically think it’s going to affect our program very badly.”
Her agency receives about 25% of its funding from federal sources, 25% from the state, and the rest in contributions, Schmitt said. 
Protas said Meals on Wheels programs are all funded through different mechanisms, so it’s difficult to tell how cuts might affect each program. Some get almost no federal funding, while others may receive 80% of funds from federal sources.
 
 Staying calm, planning ahead

Julie Govert Walter, executive director of the North Central-Flint Hills Area Agency on Aging Inc., is assessing potential cuts and trying to plan for how her agency might be affected, including the Meals on Wheels program it runs. 
“We’re right now telling people don’t panic,” she said. “We don’t want our elder Kansans to stress out over the uncertainty. At the same time, we want lawmakers in Washington to understand that the Older Americans Act programs are making significant differences in the lives of older Kansans and their caregivers and their families.”
About half of Walter’s agency budget is derived from the Older Americans Act, with about 34% of the allocation and related in-kind match donations supporting the meals program in 18 northeast Kansas counties.
Alkire said that Wichita’s Senior Services has other programs besides Meals on Wheels, including a senior employment program and four senior centers for active seniors 55 and older. 
“Meals on Wheels is our bread and butter,” she said. “We’ve got some reserves, but that wouldn’t last long.”
Walter said she believes the programs her organization runs are aligned with Trump administration policies because they’re frugal, cost-conscious and have significant volunteer support. In addition, Meals on Wheels helps seniors live independently, which often keeps them out of more costly nursing home facilities. 
Protas said the national organization is walking the line of not scaring seniors about funding cuts but making sure people are reaching out to make their voices heard.
“Many of these things that we’re worried about, there haven’t been final decisions made yet,” he said. “So we’re using this time to advocate and to just tell the story about Meals on Wheels. We’re advising our Meals on Wheels member programs to do some contingency planning so that in the event that there are delays or disruptions in funding, they’re not caught off guard. We’re not doing that in a way that instills panic, but we recognize that the threats are serious.”
 
 No budget numbers

Walter said planning right now is tough because of political uncertainties, but even more so because she doesn’t have information from the feds that she needs. Usually by this time of year, she knows what her budget is for the upcoming year. She doesn’t have those numbers yet to plan for fiscal year 2026, which will start in October. 
In mid-March, Congress funded the Older Americans Act and other programs through September 2025 with a continuing resolution. But no one knows what will happen next, Walter said. When she considers potential cuts of up to 30% of her agency’s funding, she’s not sure how to think about what actions to take. 
Options could include cutting the number of days they serve meals from five to two or three, but that would involve potential workforce cuts, she said. 
“It’s a puzzle,” she said. “We’re doing what we can to communicate with members of Congress about our situation, and I will say I think most members of the Kansas congressional delegation understand the importance of the OAA.”
 
 Little understanding of aging

Walter said one of the biggest challenges is communicating with people about the importance of Meals on Wheels and other programs for aging Kansans. 
“We all know what it’s like to be a kid, to be an adolescent, to be a young adult, and to be in middle age,” she said. “But honestly, most people don’t get what it’s like to really deal with challenges and the anxieties of being older, 75 and 80 plus, until we’re there. It’s so dependent on health and community and social relationships.”
“The stress and uncertainty is real, and it has real effects on people’s minds and hearts and spirits,” Walter said. “It’s hard to quantify, but you know it’s real. Drama is not good for older people.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4-28-25-Meals-on-Wheels-Hays-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-29 10:03:43.297250

Missouri’s Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Task Force is comprised of state senators and representatives, and the task force chose professor Rachel Winograd to represent its recommendations before the House Health and Mental Health Committee.
Winograd researches addiction science and works to develop solutions to substance abuse at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.
Changes to the state’s drug supply inspired the task force’s recommendations. Winograd said even though opioid deaths are decreasing and deaths from stimulants have plateaued, new street drugs like Xylazine (a veterinary sedative commonly known as “tranq”) complicate efforts to combat substance abuse.
“Across my last two years of sitting with the substance abuse task force, I reviewed our recommendations, which were plentiful,” Winograd said. “I did my best to cluster them in five key domains.”
 Funding

Winograd said funding for substance abuse prevention needs to increase or at least stay at its current level.
Medicaid, she said, has been crucial in caring for people with addictions without tapping into state funds.
Most state funding for substance abuse treatment comes from sales tax on cannabis and tobacco, as well as settlement funds received from tobacco companies that compensate for smoking-related medical costs.
Rep. Becky Laubinger, R-Park Hills, pointed out how the state has some of the lowest tobacco sales taxes in the nation. The tax rate per one pack of cigarettes in Missouri is 17 cents.
The task force found that the biggest gaps in funding are basic needs like recovery housing.
 Transportation and housing

“I’ve been really humbled,” Winograd said, “by how little it matters if you provide really effective evidence-based treatment service if no one can get there.”
She described transportation as an issue of “equifinality,” or how different experiences can lead to similar outcomes. In rural areas, she said, treatment centers might be too far away. In urban areas, public transportation and infrastructure might be subpar.
Some current solutions to the issue are state-provided bus passes and funds for ride-booking services from care providers, but Winograd said she doubts these solutions are the most efficient way.
Housing is another basic need that effects how those struggling with substances get the help they need.
“What good is fabulous, gold-standard care if then I go back to living on the streets,” Winograd said. “The way we work as humans operating in society is that my first priority is going to be finding housing. Then I’ll deal with my sobriety.”
She recommended flexible strategies as a solution, such as outpatient treatment combined with sober living and recovery housing.
 Crisis care

Overdose response makes up a large part of crisis care for substance abuse. Winograd praised the state’s push for behavioral health crisis centers, which she compared to urgent care facilities. However, she also recommended that those centers be required to provide medical treatment for people struggling with opioid addiction.
Another task force proposal was ambulance transport to non-hospital settings, such as behavioral health centers.
“Especially after an opioid overdose or a stimulant overamping event, often the hospital is not necessarily the best place for somebody to go,” Winograd said. “They don’t get the right care, it’s not what they want, it’s not what they need. They kind of get spun and churned back out to the streets.”
Behavioral health care centers can provide more comfortable or personalized care for such cases, she said.
The task force also recommended helping people navigate recovery programs, legalizing needle exchanges and expanding drug-checking services.
 Legal programs

Overdoses are a “huge killer” of people who have been formerly incarcerated, Winograd said.
She recommended drug courts and diversion programs in communities to help in lowering incarceration rates. She also suggested increasing resources to treat people with addictions while they are incarcerated.
The task force also recommended judicial treatment courts, which offer care as an alternative to incarceration. Winograd said the task force wants to make sure use of life-saving tools isn’t discouraged.
“There’s a real culture in specific drug courts of success and motivation,” Winograd said. “I’m looking forward to learning more about drug courts and also making sure they are as evidence-based and effective as possible, specifically ensuring that they not only allow, but encourage and support people to stay on medications for addiction treatment.”
Other legal recommendations from the task force include evidence-based treatment for the incarcerated, expanding naloxone distribution and increased funding for public defenders.
 Youth prevention

The task force found that community support and infrastructure is crucial for youth prevention of substance abuse.
“All of these things are really about letting a child have a childhood and not be running in the streets unattended and getting into dangerous stuff,” Winograd said.
The task force supported funding for youth mentoring and community service liaisons, school-based supports and youth crisis centers.
After hearing testimony in the task force, Winograd agreed that current prevention programming is not very effective, and can even be harmful.
“There is a difference between any school assembly talking about ‘don’t do drugs’ and efforts that actually work,” she said.
Winograd said targeted messaging to an age-appropriate audience can help adolescents understand what is going on inside their mind so drugs don’t seem like the easiest option.

NEWARK — In an effort to boost foot traffic downtown during the typically slow summer months, the city of Newark will offer free parking on weekends starting June 16 and running through August 15.
Approved by city council Monday night, the initiative will make parking free on Saturdays and Sundays in all city-run lots and on-street spaces.
Officials hope the move will attract more residents and visitors to the downtown area and give local businesses a summer boost.

The summer promotion replaces a previous strategy that offered discounts throughout the week during the past two summers.
City officials said those discounts had little effect on increasing downtown traffic and believe free weekend parking will be more appealing to potential visitors.
The city expects to generate $40,000 more in revenue this summer compared to last, due to the return of regular weekday parking fees.
Previous parking initiatives
This isn’t Newark’s first experiment with this type of program.
A pilot program over the winter offered it on Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays. Officials said the shift to Saturdays and Sundays was made at the request of business owners and to simplify marketing efforts.

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”










It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state. 


– David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst


Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
‘Generational change’ to taxes
While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Governor, Democrats split on regressive or progressive tax changes to close budget gap

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
An uneven tax burden
Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

Delaware officials announced a major milestone in the fight against the opioid crisis, reporting a nearly 36% decrease in drug-related deaths in 2024 compared to the previous year.
State agencies confirmed 338 drug deaths in 2024, down from 527 in 2023 and 537 in 2022.
The dramatic decline, confirmed through toxicology data from the Division of Forensic Science, mirrors broader regional and national improvements, with neighboring states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland also reporting significant drops in overdose fatalities.
“The drop in drug deaths in Delaware, the region, and in most states nationally is encouraging, but we need people to recognize the danger of the filler substances in street drugs,” said DHSS Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health (DSAMH) Director Joanna Champney. “Fentanyl is still a concern, but now we’re also very concerned with substances like medetomidine and other substances not meant for human consumption that can make people extremely sick and can result in death.”
The decline is part of a larger national trend. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. saw a 26.5% drop in drug overdose deaths between November 2023 and November 2024.
Delaware’s drop outpaced this figure, as did neighboring states like Virginia (42%) and Washington, D.C. (33%).
Officials credit the improvement to a range of initiatives, including targeted naloxone distribution, expanded addiction treatment access, and widespread public health campaigns.
They also point to a shift in drug use methods, with less injection and more smoking, which can carry a reduced overdose risk.
The state continues to invest heavily in addiction response, with more than $50 million in federal grant funding supporting treatment and outreach.
The state’s Prescription Opioid Settlement Distribution Commission (POSDC) is preparing to award another $13 million in June for addiction-related initiatives.
“Every overdose is one too many, and we still have a long road ahead of us — but we are also seeing real progress,” said Attorney General Kathy Jennings.“This is a staggering reduction in the opioid epidemic’s death toll and a testament to the dedication of our community groups, public health agencies, first responders, and state leaders who have prioritized this work. I am tremendously proud of our work to hold Big Pharma accountable for the devastation that the opioid crisis has wrought in our state, and I am in awe of the on-the-ground work that has made this progress possible.”
Lieutenant Governor Kyle Evans Gay echoed the sentiment, calling the results “promising” while urging continued focus. “We must continue advancing prevention and recovery efforts so that one day we can say Delaware has overcome this crisis.”
Despite the gains, drug overdoses remain the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 44, and Delaware officials stress that prevention, education, and treatment access will remain top priorities.
“Our job now is to double down and keep up the pressure. We have some of the best people and organizations in the country devoted to this fight, and we will not rest until overdose deaths are eradicated in Delaware,” Jennings said.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-29-at-8.58.48-AM.png,,,2025-04-29 09:08:07.889083

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska bars and liquor stores will be required to post signs warning of alcohol’s link to cancer, under a bill that became law on Friday.
The new sign mandate, to go into effect on Aug. 1, makes Alaska the first U.S. state to require such health warnings.
The warnings about the alcohol-cancer relationship will be added to already mandated warnings about the dangers that pregnant women’s consumption can lead to birth defects.
The requirement is part of a measure, Senate Bill 15, that allows employees under 21 to serve alcohol at restaurants and breweries. Lawmakers last year passed a similar bill, with the same combined provisions, but House members gave their final approval just minutes after the midnight adjournment deadline. It was one of five bills that Dunleavy vetoed because of passage after that deadline.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, was the leading proponent of the new signage. He sponsored a stand-alone measure, House Bill 37, that became combined with the alcohol-server measure; the same process was used last year, though passage of that bill was after the adjournment deadline.
This time, the combined bill on alcohol servers and cancer warnings was approved by lawmakers well before they adjourned. It won final passage with a unanimous vote in the Senate on April 4. Dunleavy allowed the measure to become law without his signature.
Alcohol consumption has been shown to increase risks of certain types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer.
Gray said the relationship has gained more attention in recent years, and he some gave credit to former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. In January, Murthy issued an advisory report describing how alcohol consumption, even at moderate levels, increases risks of at least seven types of cancer. “Alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after tobacco and obesity,” said the report. 
Murthy recommended that the label on packaging for alcoholic drinks be updated to include the cancer-risk link.
Currently, South Korea is the only nation that requires warning labels about alcohol consumption increasing cancer risks. A similar warning is set to go into effect in Ireland next year.
  The newly passed bill includes a provision, originally part of a stand-alone bill sponsored by Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, that requires warnings to be posted about alcohol use’s link to cancer. The currently requried sign is on the left; the new sign required starting on Aug. 1, 2025, is on the right. (Graphic provided by Alaska Legislature)

In California and across the country there’s a growing push to minimize the role police play when someone is in the throes of a mental health crisis. Too often, those incidents can result in the person being injured by police — and a federal court ruling has inspired fresh police concerns about their liability.
Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper recently responded with a dramatic policy change. His deputies won’t be responding to those calls unless a crime is in progress or the person in crisis has already committed a crime or placed someone else in imminent danger.

Susanna, a mother frustrated when help didn’t come: “Who is going to assist my family in these situations, and not only my family, but other families like mine, whose child might be more aggressive or might actually kill them or hurt them very badly? Who is going to step in and stop that before it’s too late?”

Already, some other police agencies around the state are following his lead.

Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes, president of the California State Sheriffs Association: “We’re not in the profession of white coats coming out to take somebody to the hospital.”

CalMatters contributor Lee Romney explores what this means for family members of people with serious mental illness, and to firefighters and social workers who rely on police for backup.
Lee also examines the quieter decision by other police and sheriffs’ departments to step back after they arrive on the scene. When that happened to one desperate mother who needed to get her son to the hospital for urgent treatment, she resorted to hiring a bounty hunter to do it.
The good news: There are other promising approaches.
But, as Lee reports, there will always be a role for well-trained law enforcement officers: When someone in crisis has a weapon or is exceptionally volatile, for instance, and when those who meet the legal criteria for involuntary psychiatric care are unwilling — or unable due to psychosis or substance abuse — to consent to care.

Trump administration cancels money to help crime victims

Under President Donald Trump, the federal government has cancelled millions of dollars worth of grants to organizations that help victims of violent crimes get back on their feet — putting some of the most vulnerable Californians at risk, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.
Last week the U.S. Justice Department cut $811 million in grants that went toward victim services and violence prevention — including more than $80 million to California organizations.
A spokesperson for the justice department said that while the department will “always protect victims of crime and legitimate law enforcement initiatives,” it will “no longer spend millions on ‘listening sessions’ and ‘bridging socio-ecological contexts.’”
Criminal justice reform advocates argue that these services aren’t a luxury, but rather part of a holistic approach to public safety. The Asian Women’s Shelter, for example, lost its three-year $500,000 grant, which went towards connecting Arab survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking with legal and social services. 

Saara Ahmed, the shelter’s communications and community engagement specialist: “The irony is that the reasons given by the Justice Department is that they’re shifting funding toward law enforcement to combat violent crime and trafficking. But violent crime and trafficking affects survivors so there’s a lot of contradiction. It’s a matter of asking: Whose safety and security are they prioritizing?”

CA reckons with effects of lost salmon

Plummeting salmon populations have forced California to shut down its commercial salmon fishing season for a third year in a row. Though some experts say efforts like this offer a glimmer of hope for the species to rebound, residents who rely on salmon fishing are weighing the possibility that the species may never fully recover — and they must seek other opportunities to keep their livelihoods afloat.
As CalMatters’ Alastair Bland explains, before the mid-2000s, Chinook salmon harvests in some California coastal towns, including Bodega Bay, were abundant and lucrative. But a combination of diverting water from the Delta, the loss of river habitat and poor ocean conditions have driven the species to the brink of collapse over the last two decades.
As the fishing economy in Bodega Bay shrinks, businesses are doing their best to adjust: Local restaurants have dropped salmon from the menu — instead featuring farmed or imported clams, oysters and shrimp — while boats that once offered fishing are turning into cruises or whale-watching expeditions. 

Mike Long, who ran a Bodega Bay fishing charter company for eight years: “Bodega Bay back in the day when the salmon were running … was an absolute party, people were camping, having fun. From a fishing standpoint, Bodega Bay has become a ghost town.”

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.













I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University





GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

(Courtesy of David Bordewyk/SDNA)I have read so many stories and opinion pieces about the decline of newspapers and community journalism that sometimes I worry if even I am losing faith in my profession.
And then I met up with a bunch of South Dakota journalists for a few days last week. And my faith was renewed plenty.
I have just returned from the 142nd convention of the South Dakota NewsMedia Association, and I am happy to report community journalism is alive and well in South Dakota.
The energy and passion demonstrated by the 100-plus South Dakota journalists who gathered in Aberdeen last week was authentic and contagious. It warmed my heart and made me proud. Proud to be in a profession that matters dearly these days.
South Dakota Searchlight wins 12 awards in annual contest

I attended my first newspaper convention in 1979 to pick up an award for a photograph of mine published in The Corsica Globe. I was hooked. I have been to many conventions since that time, having worked at SDNA since 1995. And I’ve enjoyed them all. However, I witnessed something truly special this year: journalists of all ages and backgrounds coming together to learn from one another and, just as importantly, to encourage, support and believe in one another. All things desperately needed in today’s often contentious civic arena where journalists work.
In attendance were individuals of all ages and backgrounds, from college students to publishers and editors who have been in the business for decades. Also, attendees who knew little about the profession until they took over the local newspaper because they couldn’t imagine their community without one.
During the opening lunch, I asked those who were first-time convention attendees to stand. Half of the room stood up. Young and old alike.
At that same lunch, we honored two journalists under the age of 30 for their exemplary work. Wren Murphy is a reporter at the Madison Daily Leader doing award-winning work that is making a difference for the community and audience served by that newspaper. Amelia Schafer covers the Indigenous affairs beat for the Rapid City Journal. Her six-month investigation and reporting about 38 unmarked graves at a former Indian boarding school resonated with readers and gained nationwide attention.
On Friday night, we inducted Debbie Hemmer into the South Dakota Newspaper Hall of Fame. Debbie worked at the Grant County Review in Milbank for more than four decades, eventually becoming co-owner. Her hard work and dedication over the years has helped the Review to continue its tradition as one of South Dakota’s best and largest community newspapers.
Also at the convention, we handed out more than 250 awards for excellence in community journalism. Awards for reporting and writing, commentary, photography, design, advertising and much more.










I have just returned from the 142nd convention of the South Dakota NewsMedia Association, and I am happy to report community journalism is alive and well in South Dakota.


The Dakota Scout won the 2024 SDNA Freedom of Information Award for its dogged reporting and legal challenges to obtain information about former Gov. Kristi Noem’s government credit card spending. The Aberdeen Insider is among South Dakota’s newest newspapers and won its first general excellence award – one of the highest awards we give. These are just two examples of the great work that South Dakota’s news media organizations are doing and what we celebrated during our time together in Aberdeen last week.
I firmly believe the statewide surveys we commission every few years to gauge what South Dakotans think about local newspapers and local news media organizations are spot-on.
Last year, the survey we commissioned found that more than 7 in 10 South Dakotans believe having a local newspaper or news media outlet to serve their community is very important, and more than 8 in 10 adults in our state read a newspaper every month.
Spending time last week with South Dakota journalists from across the state reaffirmed those survey results for me. These journalists are dedicated to their work and to the communities served by their newspapers and news organizations. They know better than anyone that the success and sustainability of local journalism is dependent on the support of readers, advertisers and others.
Their passion is inspiring. Their work matters. Because without journalism, democracy suffers.
Finally, here is my hot tip for the week. A 3-year-old colt named “Journalism” is the 3-1 favorite to win this Saturday’s Kentucky Derby.
Bet on journalism. Every time.

,California,2025-04-29 12:35:00+00:00,CalMatters,Bodega Bay isn’t what it used to be. How an ailing industry has transformed this fishing village,Alastair Bland,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/water/2025/04/salmon-crab-fishing-industry-bodega-bay/,"Collapsing salmon runs and restrictions on Dungeness crab have forced restaurants, charter boats and commercial fishers in California's coastal villages to adapt.","In summary
Collapsing salmon runs and restrictions on Dungeness crab have forced restaurants, charter boats and commercial fishers in California’s coastal villages to adapt.




From the living room window of their waterfront home, Carol and Tony Anello have watched the rise and fall of Bodega Bay. Traffic on Westshore Road flows past in waves, fishing boats pull into the docks and throngs of visitors line up at Spud Point Crab Co., their restaurant next door. Launched more than 20 years ago and known for its chowder and Dungeness crab rolls, the restaurant has helped make the Anellos beacons of the community. 
It has also served as a life raft as they left the commercial fishing business.   
“I had a premonition that the fishing industry was going down,” said Tony Anello, who fished commercially for salmon, crab and herring for 54 years before selling his boat Anabelle last year. “There are guys dropping out of this industry like flies, and I’m one of them.”
At Bodega Bay and other picturesque seaside villages along the California coast, the fishing economy is gradually sinking.
The latest blows came earlier this month: Commercial harvest of Chinook salmon was banned in California for the third consecutive year because of low populations, and the state’s Dungeness crab fishery has been severely restricted in an effort to protect humpback whales from entanglements. Sportfishing for salmon — a valuable industry and a beloved pastime — also was prohibited for two straight years, and will be severely cut back this year to what may amount to a single weekend in June in Northern California.  
Now coastal towns that once relied on freshly caught seafood are finding ways to adapt. In Bodega Bay, fishing has increasingly taken a backseat to tourism and the draw of souvenir shops and art galleries, saltwater taffy, waterfront dining, vacation rentals and a backdrop from Hitchcock’s “The Birds.” 
Tourism is “the lifeblood of this town now. It’s not fishing,” Tony Anello said. He nodded to the line of boats moored at the harbor — elaborate rigs that can cost the price of a Bay Area home. “All the boats are in. What are they fishing for? Niente. Nothing.”

When the salmon closure hit two years ago, sportfishing charter boat operator Ty Taube’s revenue stream was cut almost in half. To compensate, he has shifted much of his business from Bodega Bay to San Francisco Bay, where he now rents a second berth in Richmond and takes his clients fishing in the spring and summer for halibut and striped bass. 
“Bodega Bay now has very little to offer,” he said.

Mike Long, who ran a Bodega Bay fishing charter company on his boat Miss Vic for eight years, said Chinook salmon fishing used to drive a frenzy of local activity. 
“Bodega Bay, back in the day when the salmon were running … was an absolute party. People were camping, having fun,” he said. “From a fishing standpoint, Bodega Bay has become a ghost town.” 
Lucrative salmon harvests — sometimes exceeding a million fish in a season — and a robust population persisted through the mid-2000s, before the fish seemed to cross a tipping point, collapsing almost to extinction in 2009. Experts say the harvests were sustainable but that Delta water diversions, loss of river habitat and poor ocean conditions are driving the collapse of the past 20 years.
The Anellos fondly recall those banner days of their youth, and the fishery’s prime, rehashing stories of big days on the water and unloading the catch in port. 
“I remember saying, ‘My God, is there a bottom to this boat? The fish just kept coming up and coming up,” Carol Anello said.  
At nearby boat ramps, the traffic jams of the salmon season are a thing of the past, at least for now, though a trickle of skiffs still comes and goes, mostly targeting either crab or rockfish. Some anglers come to fish from shore.

Abalone, and the kelp forests they live in, also have almost vanished, the victims of overfishing and climate change. Banned in 2018, diving for abalone was a recreational attraction for decades that brought visitors and cash flow to remote North Coast communities.
A small fleet of party boat services, including Taube’s vessel Dragonfly, Pole Dancin’ and New Sea Angler, still keeps a presence in the harbor, but some don’t fish as much as they once did. Some are turning to cruises, whale-watching and ash-scattering voyages to replace lost fishing opportunities. 
Visitors to the town still expect seafood, and they still get it — but many menus feature products farmed or delivered from faraway waters, including clams, oysters and shrimp.
Local Dungeness crab has become more expensive — a boon to fishers — but it remains plentiful, even when the season ends, thanks to freezing and thawing on demand. Salmon has dropped off most local menus.

At Fishetarian Fish Market, co-owner Shane Lucas supports local boats but must lean on imported catch. This market-cafe at the south edge of town on a recent day was selling farmed New Zealand Chinook salmon under their display case, and it may shift later to wild salmon from the Pacific Northwest. Rockfish, though locally available, mostly comes from Oregon, simply because local hook-and-line commercial fishers don’t catch enough to meet his needs.
Oysters are a plentiful local product, with their crushed shells mashed into the asphalt and picnic grounds throughout town. But they are mostly farmed — not fished — in nearby Tomales Bay. Lingcod and halibut remain seasonal catches, along with albacore tuna and some bluefin, too.
Nothing, however, matches the value and cachet of Chinook salmon, also known as king salmon.
Last fall, restaurants countywide collaborated with Bodega Bay fishers and the county tourism board in a promotional push dubbed “Black Cod Week.” The idea was to promote the buttery, soft flesh of locally caught black cod, also known as sablefish, as a stand-in for salmon.  
“They were looking for an alternative fish that is highly sustainable, with lots of them out there,” said Patty Ginochio, owner of Ginochio’s Kitchen on the northeast shore of Bodega Bay, explaining that black cod is oily but delicious.
“We offered black cod tacos in lieu of the salmon tacos that we would normally have been offering,” she said. Ginochio, who has not served salmon since California’s season was shut down two years ago, also served smoked black cod. 
“No matter what you do, it’s not king salmon,” she said. 
Untangling whales and crabs 
At least for now, Dungeness crab remains a valuable fishery, though seasonal catches range wildly. 2022 saw one of the poorest statewide harvests in 40 years. 2023 was a huge year, 2024 less so and this year another bummer. 
“It’s been horrible,” said Bodega Bay commercial fisherman Dick Ogg on a recent morning as he prepared to offload and sell one of his last Dungeness crab hauls of the season at Spud Point Marina, across the road from the Anellos’ restaurant.

Ogg, who has fished out of Bodega Bay for 25 years, said profitability of crab fishing has declined, contributing to attrition in the statewide fleet. 
“The gear has gone from $50 a pot to $350 a pot, plus the rope is more expensive. The regulations are more stringent, and the time we get to fish has been condensed down to three months,” he said. “If you sit back and look at what’s happening, it’s getting to the point where you just can’t make a living.”
The West Coast’s Dungeness crab population is generally booming, and landings have soared since the early 2000s. 2024’s catch of 14 million pounds was worth $50 million, and 2023 saw the eighth largest catch — 21 million pounds — in the past 45 years. 
But new regulations have constrained the fishery, including trap limits and frequent season closures. This year, the Dungeness fishery opened late — in January — and state officials announced last week that they are shutting it down early, on May 1, in much of the state.

The complicating factor is whales — particularly humpbacks, which are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act and routinely become entangled in ropes that connect floating buoys to crab traps on the seafloor. These synthetic lines can slice deep into their skin and blubber and, when attached to heavy traps, exhaust and drown the giants. 
Entanglements have increased in the last decade following a change in feeding activity that has concentrated the animals closer to the California coast, especially from spring through summer.
“The regulations are more stringent…It’s getting to the point where you just can’t make a living” off Dungeness crab.BODEGA BAY FISHERMAN DICK OGG
Since about 2014, reported entanglements have averaged several dozen per year. Last year, 31 humpbacks were reported snagged in fishing gear off the West Coast. 
“We know that we’re only observing maybe 10%, maybe 20% of the entanglements,” said Catherine Kilduff, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. 
About 84% of entangled humpbacks may die or suffer serious injury as a result, according to an estimate by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
Shifting gears: Can an old industry learn new tricks?
Commercial crabbers are collaborating with environmental groups, including Oceana, to develop whale-safe crab gear that involves no unattended vertical ropes in the water. 
They have experimented with a system reliant on compressed buoys fixed to each trap and which inflate by remote control, lifting the cage to the surface with no rope. Another model relies on a buoy spool coiled with rope and fixed to the sunken trap, then released via remote control. When the spool surfaces, the fishers, standing by, retrieve it and their gear. 
The concept for each is brilliant, but the problem that manufacturers have struggled with is reliability. Ogg, who has tried some of these methods, said they fail too frequently to be trusted. While advocates have cited a 98% reliability figure, Ogg said it’s lower, likely less than 90%. 
Ogg plans to move ahead with a whale-safe system in which he drops a line of crab traps strung together on a single rope, then retrieves the array later by snagging it with a grappling hook dragged over the bottom.

Ogg thinks this alternative gear system could represent the future of crabbing, allowing fishers to bypass seasonal bans on conventional gear implemented when whales are near.
Retrieving gear via grapple hook takes at least twice as long per trap, Ogg said. “It’s a pain in the butt, it’s hard to do,” he said. 
But maybe worse, he said, is snagging a whale. “Nobody wants to interact with an animal other than the targeted species.” 
Boom and bust of salmon
For Taube, the glory days of the North Coast salmon fishery are just a few years gone. Taube launched his fishing charter service in 2019, cashing in on several good years. Sometimes, he said, fishing was hot enough just outside the Bodega Bay harbor that he was able to run two trips daily, each with about a half-dozen customers. 
“We would do a morning trip, and we’d do an afternoon trip … it was easy fishing,” said Taube, owner of Reel Obsession Sportfishing, which features a 34-foot boat named Dragonfly. 
Those were the days when salmon season traffic jammed up the bay’s boat ramps, when wait times could be an hour and early morning tempers sometimes flared. All morning, commercial trollers, private skiffs and charter boats like Dragonfly funneled out the mouth of the harbor, where they dispersed across the water. 
Often, the fish were barely a mile outside the Bodega Bay harbor mouth, with clouds of anchovies darkening the electronic screen of the dashboard “fish finder,” feeding whales surging in all directions and the salmon quick to strike a bait. 
“If we catch the quota quickly, then it could be done in a day or two. It’s not going to make a difference in the 100 (salmon sportfishing) trips or so that we used to run.” TY TAUBE, CAPTAIN OF THE CHARTER BOAT DRAGONFLY
This year, the tradition will resume — but perhaps for just one weekend. Recreational anglers have been allocated a sliver of a season for the first time since 2022. Fishing will begin June 7, and while multiple weekends are designated for fishing, there is a catch: a 7,000-fish quota. 
“If we catch the quota quickly, then it could be done in a day or two,” Taube said. “It’s not going to make a difference in the 100 trips or so that we used to run.” 
Along part of the Central Coast, a second fishing window, with a 7,500-fish quota, will open in September.
In the historical context, such numbers are almost nothing — what a single commercial boat might catch in a season. “Total averages (in the 1970s) would be about 80 fish a day,” Tony Anello said. 
Long left the fishing business when the salmon closure took effect two years ago. Now — like many other boat operators — he runs the Miss Vic to cash in on alternative guiding opportunities. 
“We do whale-watching trips now,” he said.

Graphs depicting past abundance show a towering wall of California Chinook through the 1980s and 90s. In the record year of 1988, ocean harvest in California — commercial and recreational combined — amounted to nearly 1.4 million salmon, the best year on record. Even after that huge harvest, more than 200,000 fish returned to the Sacramento River to spawn that fall and in 2002, more Chinook swam into the Central Valley than ever recorded before — about 900,000 adults.  
Salmon abundance plunged off a cliff in the late 2000s, and it has never recovered. Just 140,000 adults migrated up the Central Valley’s rivers last year, and that came after two years with essentially no harvest. 
Return of the salmon
A salmon rebound would change everything, and it’s something state officials are calling for. 
“We are hell-bent … pushing as hard as we can, because we hate the idea of a future California without salmon,” said Chuck Bonham, director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
Some positive signals, maybe suggesting a comeback, are emerging from the watersheds where salmon spawn — due, Bonham says, to the state’s restoration efforts as well as the record wet year in 2023. Wet winters increase river flows, which help juvenile salmon reach the ocean, and can be a precursor to salmon rebounds. Bonham is optimistic that next year will see a bump. Already, numbers of spawning endangered coho salmon in coastal watersheds jumped last winter to several times the recent historical average.   
In the Sacramento River, premature returning Chinook — two-year-old males known to biologists as “jacks” — returned in very large numbers last fall. That could reflect a swelling population in the ocean. 
A major victory was recently scored in the Klamath basin, where four dams were removed from 2023 to 2024. Already, Chinook are reported to be entering spawning habitat that was inaccessible for decades, and experts and local tribes anticipate a revival.  
“We are hell-bent … pushing as hard as we can, because we hate the idea of a future California without salmon.”CHUCK BONHAM, DIRECTOR OF  CALIFORNIA DEPT. OF FISH AND WILDLIFE 
Bonham said a state policy of “cutting the green tape” has allowed faster movement on projects to rebuild habitat features like wetlands and floodplains, mostly in the Central Valley. Another new state policy allowing project developers to pack multiple project permits into a single approval has helped the state make progress on salmon restoration work. 
“Just last year, we streamlined the approvals for 60 important projects related to salmon,” he said. “We don’t have a chance to dink around and take 20 more years.” We need “more good projects faster and cheaper,” he said. 
Fishery experts and advocates say the state is not doing enough to save salmon. Scott Artis, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Association, an industry group, said the state has failed to guarantee that Central Valley rivers contain adequate cold water for salmon. He said reservoirs are drained too early, which depletes the supply of cold water essential for successful spawning, and too much water is pumped to farms and cities to the south. 
“Dead salmon don’t use habitat,” Artis said. “So if we kill all the salmon because there is no water, are we really creating habitat and allowing them to use it?”
Relics of a thriving industry
At Bodega Bay, an old fishing pier, succumbing to saltwater and wind, is falling to pieces and is no longer accessible. 
The local ice machine, installed at the Spud Point Marina in the 1980s, is in disrepair, too.
“It’s long past its life expectancy,” said Noah Wagner, marina supervisor for the Sonoma County Regional Parks Department, which operates the facility. “We’re very concerned that we’re going to have a catastrophic failure that necessitates a complete replacement of that ice house during one of these really important seasons for the salmon or crab.”
Officials with the state and county visited last year, part of an ongoing quest for funding to modernize the ice house, which is the only one of its kind between San Francisco and Fort Bragg, Wagner said. “All the fishing boats and the processors … rely on this ice house, so it’s vitally important to the fleet,” he said.

While the community thrives on the bustling tourism economy, many residents and business owners are worried about the town’s fishers.
Waves of Compassion is a local nonprofit that, among other things, helps struggling commercial fishers in and around Bodega Bay with food, clothes, laundry money, dog food and other items that Ginochio, a cofounder, says many fishers increasingly cannot afford. 
Lucas, at Fishetarian, sees a gray future for the local fishing economy.  
“It’s sad because my grandfather was a commercial fisherman, but I don’t think there will be a commercial fisherman left here in 10 years,” he said. “They’re going to be all gone. To support a family in California as a commercial fisherman, you’ve got to be doing something else.”

Justin Kloczko
Justin Kloczko is a tech and privacy advocate at Consumer Watchdog.


Let’s say you work in the food service industry for a large company, whose scheduling software assigns shifts to workers. For you, which shifts you receive mean everything because much of your salary depends on tips. But in the eyes of the algorithm, you could be deprioritized and miss out on lucrative weekend shifts based on mysterious data. Without your knowledge, information such as when you take a break, how fast you turned over a table or where you live could work against you. 
Shouldn’t you have the right to know the logic behind the algorithm, and the right to opt out of its automated decision?
Californians were on track to have novel protections against automated decisions under rules drafted by California’s top privacy agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency. But this month, the privacy board proposed substantially narrower privacy regulations, including deleting specific protections — like the example above — surrounding criminal justice, education, essential goods like food, and employment matters if they were made by automated decisions. 
Some members even suggested deleting the automated decision-making language altogether. The five-member board also committed to deleting other rules aimed at giving people control of their personal information in the training of artificial intelligence and in targeted advertising. 
We are at a major crossroads in California’s battle over data privacy protections. After the establishment of the landmark California Consumer Privacy Act and its 2020 voter-enacted California Privacy Rights Act, forces within the privacy agency and Gov. Gavin Newsom, under pressure from powerful business interests, are pushing to scale back these seminal protections. A key hearing is scheduled for Thursday.
After the departure of the protection agency’s first leader, Ashkan Soltani, and the very questionable dismissal of privacy-facing board member Vinhcent Le, there has been a shift away from the pro-consumer mission statement of the small but influential agency. The new head of the agency is Tom Kemp, a tech entrepreneur. The real estate developer who spurred the state’s data privacy law is now among some of its biggest skeptics.
But wouldn’t you want to know if algorithms, not people, were deciding sensitive aspects of your life and at least have the option to stop it? Automated decisions dictate everything from how we get jobs to essential services or mortgages, for example, in rapid, nonchalant and unaccountable fashion. 
The privacy agency’s board members already recommended loosening opt outs for targeted advertising and training data that feeds artificial intelligence systems. Without opt-outs, companies can indefinitely train AI models on your personal data without consent, and because you said the word baby, the algorithm thinks you’re a parent and bombards you with parenting ads on every feed.
Californians complain about this stuff all the time.
The privacy agency doesn’t have to listen to the governor. Board members just have to read the voter-passed Proposition 24 and the privacy act statute, which directs them to draft regulations in the interest of privacy — not in favor of the interests of a few large tech companies. 
More importantly, the right to privacy is enshrined in the first article of the California Constitution. By letting algorithms and AI take the reins, we relieve ourselves of responsibility — a comfort that comes at the cost of our own control. 
We are supposed to be in a new era of privacy, and California is supposed to be leading that charge. Instead, we’re willingly moving to the back of the line. We’ve heard these industry threats for decades now — that regulations will be too costly — yet tech companies have only grown and remain rooted in our state after 20 years of dominance.

Groups that support California crime victims and attempt to reduce gun violence lost millions of dollars in grants when the Trump administration pulled funding.


Dozens of California violence prevention and victim service programs, including ones to protect survivors of domestic violence and end sexual abuse in jails and prisons, are facing devastating cuts after the Trump administration abruptly pulled funding from them. 
“These programs literally save lives – not just for the victims, but for our entire communities,” said Tinisch Hollins, executive director of the nonprofit organization Californians for Safety and Justice. “When they go away, we lose a safety net.”
The U.S. Justice Department last week slashed grants that were initially valued at $811 million. In California alone, the department cut just over $80 million, the majority of which was for groups based in Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco, according to a U.S. Justice Department document obtained and published by Reuters. 
The organizations might have already spent some of the grant funding, which typically lasts for three years, and it’s unclear how much the administration clawed back. They have 30 days to appeal the decision. The U.S. Justice Department did not respond to repeated attempts to confirm the list of affected grant recipients in California. 
In a statement to CalMatters, Justice Department spokesman Gates McGavick said, “Under Attorney General (Pam) Bondi’s leadership, the Department of Justice is committed to ensuring its resources are spent on arresting criminals, getting drugs off the streets, and crucial litigation. We will always protect victims of crime and legitimate law enforcement initiatives, but we will no longer spend millions on ‘listening sessions’ and ‘bridging socio-ecological contexts.’”
California officials rejected the Trump administration’s characterization of the grants, and described the programs as critical.
“The Trump administration is recklessly disregarding the safety of the people it is sworn to serve,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement to CalMatters. “These resources are not optional luxuries, they are essential, and critical to ensuring the security and stability of our communities nationwide. My office will do everything in our power to stop the potentially deadly consequences of freezing federal funding.”
Representatives from three organizations that lost money told CalMatters they were committed to continuing their programs, and they stressed that they provide vital services to vulnerable people.
In Oakland, the nonprofit organization Youth ALIVE! lost its $2 million grant to support the nation’s first hospital-based violence intervention program. The organization’s staff appear at the hospital bedside of youth who have been violently injured in order to help them navigate their recovery and prevent retaliatory violence. 
Through ongoing support such as mental health and housing services, the organization maintains that it can break cycles of violence. Last year, it served 113 clients, only one of whom was injured again.
“It’s an essential part of the ecosystem, because you need to be in specific places to help quell violence and help people heal,” said Dr. Joseph Griffin, executive director of Youth ALIVE! “It’s about increasing the health of the community.”
When he learned that the organization had lost its funding, he said he was in disbelief. 
“It’s not an impact that we can absorb lightly,” he said. “Replacing $2 million is never easy.”

Elsewhere in Oakland, the organization Impact Justice lost $8.5 million in grant funding.
“This was a sledgehammer,” said Alex Busansky, its founder and president.
The organization was awarded a $4 million grant to expand opportunities for reentry housing for people returning home from prison. It also received three grants totaling $4.5 million to support its work in eliminating sexual abuse and sexual harm from confined facilities, such as prisons and jails. 
“To take that away puts the most vulnerable people in a much riskier and potentially harmful situation,” Busansky said. 
Asian Women’s Shelter, one of three domestic violence shelters in San Francisco, lost its $500,000 grant to support Arab survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking through connecting them with legal and social services. 
The competitive grant had only been awarded to five organizations last year, according to the Asian Women’s Shelter’s communications and community engagement specialist, Saara Ahmed. 
“The irony is that the reasons given by the Justice Department is that they’re shifting funding toward law enforcement to combat violent crime and trafficking. But violent crime and trafficking affects survivors so there’s a lot of contradiction,” Ahmed said. “It’s a matter of asking: Whose safety and security are they prioritizing?”
On April 25, over 600 local, state and national organizations, including the Asian Women’s Shelter, signed a letter to Attorney General Bondi expressing “deep concern” over the Justice Department’s federal funding decisions, including the canceled grants.
“This longstanding bipartisan commitment to supporting services and prevention efforts for victims of [domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking and trafficking] remains strong; however, the Department’s recent actions have left these critical lifesaving programs uncertain about their ability to continue serving victims,” advocates wrote. 
The San Francisco District Attorney’s Office also lost a grant in the culling. “It is heartbreaking to see funds cut for such critical work,” said San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, whose grant supported at-risk youth and young adults from underserved communities. 
“Public safety, at its core, is fewer victims of crime overall. And as a government, we cannot simply be reactionary,” she said. “We have to do the front end, proactive work so that people don’t feel the need to get involved in crime in the first place.”

Assembly Bill 215 would prohibit high school teenagers from working between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. before a school day. Teens aged 14 and 15 are already prohibited by federal law from working between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m., but the Nevada proposed law would put in place restrictions for 16-, 17- and 18-year olds who are enrolled in public or private school.
Emancipated teenagers, lifeguards, arcade workers, farm workers, and theatrical performers would be exempt from the hourly restrictions. Additional exemptions could be granted on a case-by-base basis.
The bill would also lower the maximum number of hours a child under 16 can work: from 48 to 40 hours per week.
“Every single day in my classes I have kids who are too tired to participate,” said Matt Nighswonger, a teacher at Shadow Ridge High School on the northern edge of the Las Vegas Valley. “When I wake them up and ask them why they’re so tired, they tell me they had to close, or had to work late last night. Many of them have to work until 1 or 2 in the morning.”
The business community, he said, is taking advantage of vulnerable teenagers.
“As a government teacher, I try to teach my students that the government is here to protect its citizens,” he added. “AB215 helps to protect our exploited high school workers.”
Karissa Murdoch was one of those teens. The Shadow Ridge senior began working at a local ice rink at 15. She started with a reasonable workload, then she asked for more hours because she wanted more money, then she was asked by her bosses to stay late after her official shift to do extra work.
That’s how she found herself regularly working until midnight Monday through Thursday. After the commute home, eating and showering, she was going to bed at 1 or 2 a.m. and sleeping a paltry few hours before school started up again at 7 a.m.
Her grades slipped. She says she went from being a student who “almost never turned in an assignment late” to a student who couldn’t stay awake in class and turned in everything late. Murdoch said she came to her senses on her own and now wants to advocate for her younger self.
“At 15, I was nowhere near mature enough to prioritize school over money,” she told Assembly members during the bill’s first hearing, which she traveled to Carson City for over spring break in March. “I wish the adults around me would have thought about more than just using me for business gain.”
Teagan Clark, another Shadow Ridge student, testified that working closing shift meant driving home late at night tired — a potentially dangerous scenario for anyone but especially an inexperienced driver. It also resulted in her skipping breakfast in order to get an extra few minutes of sleep, drinking too many caffeine-filled energy drinks, and feeling isolated socially.
Nighswonger said he surveyed working high school seniors at Shadow Ridge and found that 48% regularly work past 10 p.m. on school nights. Many of the students were worried they would lose their job if they shared their own stories, though a few hand-wrote letters for him to deliver to lawmakers.
“I work at a car wash and every night we close at 8 and I stay after hours to clean the vacuum trays and sewage out of the tunnel where the cars are washed,” read one. “It’s too much for a 17 year old kid, but I don’t want to lose my job.”

 
Equipo Academy Assistant Principal Erik Van Houten said a quarter of 16- and 17-year-olds at the East Las Vegas charter school have jobs, and 1 in 5 of them work over 40 hours a week.
“These students are ill equipped to advocate for themselves to leave work at reasonable hours,” he said. “Many are holding their very first job.”
AB215, he continued, would ”put guardrails in place to protect our kids and make clear that a high school education should be their number one priority.”
Nighswonger, Murdoch and other Shadow Ridge students pitched the proposed law to Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno and Republican Assemblymember Brian Hibbetts, whose districts cover the school’s enrollment area. Both signed on to sponsor a bill on the issue.
Independently, Democratic Assemblymember Cinthia Zermeño Moore was working on similar legislation inspired by concerns raised by Van Houten from Equipo, which is located in her district.The three Assembly members decided to combine their bills and work together.
Strong support, but some concerns raised
AB215 passed the Nevada State Assembly with unanimous bipartisan support earlier this month and is now making its way through the Senate. If passed, the bill will head to Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s desk for final approval.
Hibbetts acknowledged that some might see the inclusion of protections for 18-year-olds as a problem because it means they are being considered adults in some legal contexts and not adults in others. But he said there is precedent.
High school students are not allowed to sign off on their own school paperwork just because they turn 18 during their senior year, he said. They still need parental signatures.
“This is, in my vision, just going along with that same type of mentality,” he said. “I think this is something that we need to offer them. Just because you’re 18, it doesn’t mean your employer can make you work until 2 a.m. because you have to be at school at 7 a.m.”
Monroe-Moreno added that the inclusion of 18-year-olds was specifically asked for by Shadow Ridge students who said their managers target them for late shifts because they are 18.
Several lawmakers in the bill’s two hearings raised concerns about the impact the legislation might have on lower income families whose teens contribute to essential household bills.
Moore said she understands that reality, adding that her first job was at age 14 selling CDs at the Indoor Swap Meet in East Las Vegas. But she argued the state needs to support students with their education because, without it, “they may not be able to seek the opportunities they may have” that could lift them, and their families, upward.
Teresa Benitez-Thompson, a former state lawmaker, spoke in personal support of the bill, saying she wished such restrictions were in place two decades ago when she was a teenage hostess whose paychecks helped support her single mom, who worked as a waitress, and her sister, who was a teen mom at 15. She said she fell behind her junior year and had to do credit recovery to get back on track.
“A low-wage job for a teenager is not going to solve poverty,” she said. “Education is what breaks the cycle of poverty. Education is absolutely what has to be prioritized.”
Groups in support of AB218 included the Vegas Chamber, Nevada Resorts Association, NAACP, City of North Las Vegas, and ACLU.
No groups publicly opposed AB218 during its two bill hearings, but the Nevada Restaurant Association testified in neutral.
“We support efforts to balance student well being and academics with valuable work experience,” the group’s lobbyist, Peter Saba, said. “Many restaurants rely on student workers, and we encourage ongoing discussions to ensure these small businesses can adapt smoothly.”
Monroe-Moreno acknowledged that concessions were made to appease business groups. The bill originally sought to prohibit teens from working past 10 p.m. on school nights but the time was amended to 11 p.m.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2173891470-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 09:08:07.889083

(Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)Tens of thousands of square feet of vacant lots and commercial properties sit empty in the Las Vegas and Reno metro areas. Proposed legislation attempts to help tackle the state’s housing crisis by establishing a process to rezone them as residential. 
State lawmakers are considering multiple proposals that would empower cities to more aggressively encourage infill development to address Nevada’s shortage of affordable and available units.
Assembly Bill 241, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, is designed to spark development of more multi-family housing, and require counties to speed up the process to rezone land currently designated commercial use into residential or mixed use. 
“Many commercial properties, particularly aging strip malls and vacant office buildings, are underutilized,” Jauregui said during the bill’s hearing in March. “Repurposing them for housing makes better use of existing infrastructure. Building homes closer to jobs, schools and public transit reduces commute times, lowers greenhouse gas emissions and decreases urban sprawl.”
The bill, which passed the Assembly on a party line vote earlier this month, is directed toward the state’s most populous counties, Clark and Washoe, and would give them until Oct. 1, 2026 to adopt an ordinance that allows for a more expedited rezoning process. 
Under the legislation, if a buyer purchases a commercial property and wants to build multi-family housing on it instead, they could seek swift approval rather than go through a lengthy rezoning process, Jauregui said. 
A recent analysis by the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern and the regional planning collaborative known as Southern Nevada Strong identified 78,285 acres as “vacant or underutilized land,” most of it — 85% — vacant.
The bill is scheduled to be heard Wednesday in the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee.
The legislation’s supporters included theNevada Conservation Leaguethe Nevada State Apartment Association. 
However, the Nevada Association of Counties along with Clark and Washoe County opposed the legislation.
“There are some commercial areas where multi-family or mixed-use (zoning) may not be appropriate,” said Ashley Kennedy, a lobbyist with Clark County, adding the county wants to retain “the ability at the local level to determine” when to quickly rezone without state legislation mandating it. 
Kennedy said that the county supports infill development and hasn’t denied any application for a multi-family project since 2022. 
She added that during that timeframe there were 39 applications for multi-family projects approved, and 21 of those applications were in commercially zoned areas.”
Cadence Matijevich, a lobbyist with Washoe County, warned the bill would produce “unintended consequences” and could “upset the balance of land use in our community” by requiring some commercial projects to be rezoned as residential. 
“Nevada cannot afford to let outdated zoning laws and people who oppose density continue to be the reason we are stalling housing production,” Jauregui said. 
Efforts to promote infill development come as state lawmakers, some members of Nevada’s Congressional delegation and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo have pushed for stepped up sales of federal land development. 
Assembly Joint Resolution 10, also sponsored by Jauregui, would ask the federal government to pass the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act, commonly referred to as the Clark County Lands Bill.
The bill passed the Assembly 36-6 April 17. Six Democrats Assemblymembers, Natha Anderson, Venicia Considine, Tanya Flanagan, Selena La Rue Hatch, Cinthia Moore, and Howard Watts, voted against the resolution.
Democratic Rep. Dina Titus recently took issue with state lawmakers voting for the resolution  and denounced the federal bill, saying nothing in the legislation mandates that any of the land must be dedicated to affordable housing. The bill would only make land available “to developers to build more homes that average Nevadans cannot afford,” Titus said. 
AB 241 isn’t the only bill that could lead to more infill development.
Senate Bill 28, legislation being brought by the City of Las Vegas, would create “tax increment areas” in which a portion of future property tax revenue would be used to pay interest on bonds used to finance  affordable housing development as well as public transit.
Much of the city’s development over the next 25 years “will consist of infill and redevelopment within existing neighborhoods, Seth Floyd, Director of Community Development for the City of Las Vegas, told the Senate Government Affairs Committee during a hearing on the bill in lawmakers during the bill’s hearing in March.” 
SB 28 passed the Senate 17-4 on April 17. Republican Sens. Carrie Ann Buck, Robin Titus, Ira Hansen and John Ellison voted against the bill.  
Funding supportive housing
Lawmakers are also considering allocating general fund dollars to aid housing development, including $250 million proposed by Lombardo.  
Any proposal seeking to allocate any funding could face serious setbacks after the Economic Forum meets Thursday, when it will set final budget limits that legislators and the governor must meet when they approve a budget for the upcoming biennium. 
Uncertainty and anxiety driven by Donald Trump’s trade war and the resulting fallout have prompted widespread projections of not only a slowing economy, with many observers projecting the chance of a recession has increased substantially in recent weeks.
Assembly Bill 366, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, would appropriate $25 million from the state general fund to supportive housing initiatives throughout the state. The Nevada Housing Division would determine the projects eligible to receive those dollars.  
Permanent supportive housing projects are subsidized for populations with significantly low or no income, such as folks experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, and comes with case management and wrap-around support services. 
Brooke Page, the Nevada director of the Corporation for Supportive Housing, said funding supportive housing for unhoused people is more cost effective than the alternative.
The organization conducted an analysis for Northern Nevada last year that found eight days in the emergency room, three months in jail, and one year in supportive housing with rental assistance and warp around services all cost the same. Page said. 
“It makes more sense to house people, ensure they have the services they need to improve their mental health, their physical health, and gain access to employment than it does to continue to allow people to cycle in and out of high-cost systems,” she said. 
Not only do developers struggle to find financing for supportive housing, funding for operational support and tenant services is also limited.
State lawmakers in 2023 allocated $30 million from the state’s general fund to permanent supportive housing projects. 
AB 366 seeks to strengthen the program.. 
During its first hearing in March, Monroe-Moreno said though the state “doesn’t have any money” allocating funds for permanent supportive housing was a priority Lombardo also identified during his budget proposal, she said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Public Service Commission approved a 4.7% increase in residential electricity rates on Friday, only about a quarter of the 18.1% that Rocky Mountain Power requested last August — and an even more substantial reduction than the original 30.5% increase proposal that appalled Utah leaders.
With the change, an average single-family residential customer using 700 kilowatt hours per month will see a monthly increase in their utility bill of $4.31 this year, about $10 less than Rocky Mountain Power proposed. 
Commissioners said in the order that the 18.1% ask was unprecedented both in the scope of issues it addressed and price. Ultimately, the decision to only approve a small portion of the rate proposal was attributed to the reasons Gov. Spencer Cox and legislative leaders had cited as they promised to do everything in their power to avoid such an increase — Utah ratepayers shouldn’t pay for other states’ costs.

“I think there’s two themes to this case,” Chris Parker, director of the Utah Division of Public Utilities, said on Monday. “They are that the commission wants to make sure that Utahns aren’t paying expenses that need to be borne by other states’ customers, and that Utahns should not be paying for imprudent actions by the utility.”
After wildfires plagued Oregon in 2020, PacifiCorp, Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company, saw an impact in its equity and also “paid $550 million in dividends to its parent company, Berkshire Hathaway, after it became aware of potential wildfire liability,” according to the order. 
“The current capital structure of the company is primarily a result of its own actions,” commissioners wrote. “It is unreasonable to expect RMP’s ratepayers in Utah to pay higher rates because of the wildfires in Oregon and the depletion of cash reserves by these dividend payments.” 
Rocky Mountain Power lowers its rate increase proposal to 18.1%, down from 30.5%

The commission also rejected making payments for insurance premiums “driven far beyond industry norms for Utah,” legal fees associated with the Oregon wildfire litigation, and other costs tied to “specific state climate action policies or specific state agreements driven by individual state circumstances (particularly in Washington and Oregon).”
The order, however, approved some smaller expenses for wildfire mitigation, and an increase in the low-income Lifeline assistance credit, an electricity bill discount program for low income Utahns — from $13.95 to $18 a month.
As of Monday afternoon, PacifiCorp was still reviewing the nearly 200-page order, David Eskelsen, a spokesperson for the company, said. 
“We are determining its implications and our next steps in meeting our responsibility to provide electric service to our customers,” Eskelsen said in a statement. 
It’s possible that the company could appeal the decision, triggering a revision process. The utility is also expected to present its case in May to recover some past costs through its Energy Balancing Account — a price adjustment that either credits or debits users for differences between power prices and the other market costs that are somewhat outside the control of the utility.
PacifiCorp has also taken legal action against other states it serves, like Wyoming, for their partial denial of rate increase.
The rate change took effect immediately once the commission’s order was issued.
A controversial rate increase 
Utah has for years flaunted its ranking at the top of states with the cheapest electricity. So, when Rocky Mountain Power proposed a two-digit increase in rates, it woke tensions with the state.
The company listed increased costs of fuel and wholesale power in addition to ongoing new electric transmission and generation projects for a substantial part of the 30.5% rate increase, as well as the escalation of wildfire risk insurance premiums.



Let us know what you think...


 


That triggered legislative proposals to change Rocky Mountain Power’s rate structure, a firm request to split PacifiCorp into two consortiums of blue or red states, and a strong social media post from Cox. 
“The proposal is completely unacceptable,” the governor wrote on an X post in June. “The audacity and lack of awareness with this request seriously calls into question management at RMP. I will do everything I can to make sure a rate increase of that magnitude never sees the light of day.”
Changes are coming to Rocky Mountain Power’s contracts with AI centers, but not its rate structure

Some of those bills, including one that would have made Rocky Mountain Power pay for everything that’s currently included in the Energy Balancing Account, didn’t materialize. But, there’s still a big focus on studying the utility’s books to determine what costs should and shouldn’t be in Utahns’ bills. 
Parker, from the Division of Public Utilities, said that a big item the commission denied last year in the company’s Energy Balancing Account case was tied to expenses covering the cost of greenhouse gas allowances the utility bought to comply with a Washington state law. 
And this time, the denials are mostly because of wildfire liability. While he sympathizes with the company’s challenges, he said it’s its duty to provide appropriate services at reasonable rates.
“And if that requires additional infusions of equity that ratepayers aren’t responsible for paying, then that’s what it requires. That’s their obligation,” Parker said. “The privilege of being a public utility is that you’re a monopoly, and the obligation of being a public utility is that you have to act in the public interest.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Two bills that would change Alabama’s bail system are working their way through the Legislature in the waning days of the 2025 session.
The Senate Judiciary Committee hosted a public hearing Wednesday for HB 42, sponsored by Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, which gives judges the authority to allow defendants to pay a portion of their total bond to be released from pretrial detention.
HB 410, sponsored by Rep. Shane Stringer, R-Citronelle, which was approved by the House Judiciary Committee, modifies the composition of the Alabama Professional Bail Bonding Board, expands the exemptions for the fees that bail bond companies must pay the court, increases penalties for bail jumping and adds more regulations for bail bond companies when they operate in another state.

A message was sent to Stringer Monday seeking comment.
HB 42 has passed the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The House is scheduled to vote on HB 410 on Tuesday. England’s bill adds three words, “a part of” back into an  Alabama statute that were removed when the same Legislature enacted the Alabama Bail Reform Act of 1993.
The removal of the words meant judges in the state could not allow defendants to pay a percentage of their bond to get release from pretrial detention.
“What that translates into is a large amount of money that would normally go to the court system, instead of going to the court system, it goes to a bondsman,” England said to the committee Wednesday.
People can secure their release after an arrest if they pay a bail bond company. The premium, which is typically 10% of the total amount of the bond, is paid to the bail bond company, which then must ensure the individuals go to their court appearances.
The money that people pay when released on a percentage bond would be retained by the court and kept if defendants fail to appear for their court dates.
The Alabama Bail Bond Association has been a vocal opponent of the bill, speaking out against the legislation at a March public hearing and the House Judiciary Committee considered it then and eventually approved the bill a week later.
Victor Howard, vice president of the Alabama Bail Bond Association and bail bond company owner, said that enacting the legislation would reduce accountability for defendants to appear for their court dates.
Chris McNeil, the president of the Alabama Bail Bond Association, suggested Monday in an interview that the rates that people would not appear for court would increase. He also cited records from the Alabama Administrative Office of Courts saying that people who paid cash to be released from pretrial detention in 2022 and 2023 had a failure to appear (FTA) rate of 55%.
“The court just can’t function when you have a failure to appear rate of 55%,” McNeil said Monday. “The bonding companies were averaging about a 14%-15% failure to appear rate. And were able to trim that rate by returning defendants back to court.”
England told the committee that the numbers do not present a fair comparison to percentage bonds.
“The numbers are obviously going to be off because there are more people on smaller offenses with cash bonds versus somebody who is on a large bond with a bondsman,” England said to the committee on Wednesday. “Obviously, there is going to be a higher number of FTAs on smaller cases, traffic tickets, because they all count.”
Jerome Dees, policy director from the Southern Poverty Law Center, supported the legislation.
“The vast majority of times when there was an FTA that was ultimately secured, and the defendant showed up in court, it largely was due to law enforcement bringing that individual in and not the bail bond company,” he said to the committee on Wednesday. “That is not to say that it never happened, but the vast majority of time it was law enforcement bringing that particular individual in.”
McNeil said in an interview Monday he supports HB 410, Stringer’s bill.
“It expands the Alabama Professional Bail Bonding Board by adding a sheriff to the board, adding a layperson, so I think that is very important,” he said.
It also states that any fees that bail bond companies pay to the court that have not been deposited within 90 days and that have an expiration date “shall be deemed uncollected” and will no longer hold the bail bond company responsible for making the payment.
The bill also exempts bail bond companies from fees that the courts or district attorneys have not attempted to collect past one year from the original due date.
HB 410 also adds more conditions such that the bail bond company will not pay a fee, known as forfeiture, to the court when in cases that the defendant fails to appear in court.
McNeil said the bill would cancel that forfeiture payment if someone was not placed in the National Crime Information Center and failed to appear in court, or if the bail bond company brings back a defendant that the jail refuses to accept.
The bill also addresses instances when an individual travels out of state and enhances the penalty for bail jumping, going from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class D felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a $7,500 fine.

Richard Wright wrote his memoir about growing up in Roxie, Miss., called “Black Boy.” Credit: Wikipedia
“Black Boy,” Richard Wright’s memoir about his upbringing in Roxie, Mississippi, became the top-selling book in the U.S. 
Wright described Roxie as “swarming with rats, cats, dogs, fortune tellers, cripples, blind men, whores, salesmen, rent collectors, and children.” 
In his home, he looked to his mother: “My mother’s suffering grew into a symbol in my mind, gathering to itself all the poverty, the ignorance, the helplessness; the painful, baffling, hunger-ridden days and hours; the restless moving, the futile seeking, the uncertainty, the fear, the dread; the meaningless pain and the endless suffering. Her life set the emotional tone of my life.” 
When he was alone, he wrote, “I would hurl words into this darkness and wait for an echo, and if an echo sounded, no matter how faintly, I would send other words to tell, to march, to fight, to create a sense of the hunger for life that gnaws in us all.” 
Reading became his refuge. 
“Whenever my environment had failed to support or nourish me, I had clutched at books,” he wrote. “Reading was like a drug, a dope. The novels created moods in which I lived for days.” 
In the end, he discovered that “if you possess enough courage to speak out what you are, you will find you are not alone.” He was the first Black author to see his work sold through the Book-of-a-Month Club. 
Wright’s novel, “Native Son,” told the story of Bigger Thomas, a 20-year-old Black man whose bleak life leads him to kill. Through the book, Wright sought to expose the racism he saw: “I was guided by but one criterion: to tell the truth as I saw it and felt it. I swore to myself that if I ever wrote another book, no one would weep over it; that it would be so hard and deep that they would have to face it without the consolation of tears.” 
The novel, which sold more than 250,000 copies in its first three weeks, was turned into a play on Broadway, directed by Orson Welles. He became friends with other writers, including Ralph Ellison in Harlem and Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus in Paris. His works played a role in changing white Americans’ views on race.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/06001214/April29-FeatImage-Richard_Wright.jpg,,,2025-04-29 09:08:07.889083

This story was originally reported by Jasmine Mithani of The 19th.  Meet Jasmine and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
President Donald Trump has taken aim at trans people during his first 100 days in office in his second term. He has sought to restrict access to accurate passports, erase the accomplishments of trans elders, remove transgender members from the military and purge the government of what he has termed “woke gender ideology.” But a new 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll shows that 49% of Americans think politicians should not be focusing on transgender issues at all.
It’s a rise from before the election, when 43% of Americans said they believed politicians should not focus on trans issues, versus protecting trans rights or restricting gender-affirming care. In 2023, the figure was 44%.
Democrats and Independents are less likely than they were in September to think politicians should be protecting transgender rights, and 42% of Democrats think politicians should not focus on trans issues — up from 33% last year.
More Republicans also think politicians shouldn’t focus on trans issues — 57% vs 53% last year — and the number who think lawmakers should concentrate on restricting transgender rights has fallen.
Overall, despite the Trump administration’s attempts to erase trans people from public life, the majority of Americans (59%) support the right of transgender adults to access gender-affirming care. However, fewer Americans, 43%, support the right of trans youth to seek such care. That doesn’t necessarily translate into a desire for bans. In fact, 55% opposed laws that would restrict gender-affirming care for minors, including 41% of Republicans and 57% of Independents.
Gender-affirming care for trans people is any health care designed to support and affirm their gender identity, and typically differs depending on age. For trans adults, care can include therapy, consultations with doctors, hormones or other medication, and surgery. For trans youth, gender-affirming care can include therapy, consultations with doctors, hormones or puberty blockers, other medication, and, rarely, surgery. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health does not recommend gender-affirming gential surgeries for anyone under 18.
The results are from a 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll conducted online from April 11-21, 2025, among 5,032 American adults. Results have a margin of error of 1.5 percentage points.
The majority of Americans are not confident that politicians are informed enough about gender-affirming care for transgender minors to make fair policy. But the number who say they are informed enough has risen from 24% last year to 31% this year.
Women continue to be more likely than men to support access to gender-affirming care for both adults (65% versus 52%) and youth (46% versus 38%). While this survey collected only binary gender data, a 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll from September showed widespread support for access among nonbinary and transgender Americans.
Movement in favor of transgender rights is notable given how central antri-trans rhetoric was to Trump’s campaign, which is now manifesting into federal policy impacting hundreds of thousands of lives.
Meanwhile, Democrats are split on whether to support their trans constituents. In the immediate aftermath of the election, some congressional Democrats loudly criticized their party for supporting trans people. And in the inaugural episode of his new podcast,  California Gov. Gavin Newsom signaled interest in restricting how trans women athletes can compete in sporting events.
But others, like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, have vocally condemned Trump’s anti-trans policies and refused to back down.
This was notably seen a couple months into the Trump administration, when Senate Democrats did band together to block a bill which would have prevented transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports teams in federally-funded schools.
This 19th News|SurveyMonkey poll was conducted online from April 11-21, 2025, among a national sample of 5,032 U.S. adults 18+. Respondents were selected from the more than two million people who take surveys on SurveyMonkey each day. Results for this non-probability survey have an error estimate of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)The Democratic National Committee will transfer more than $1 million per month to its state and territorial parties over the next four years in an effort to build state-level infrastructure and operations, the DNC announced Thursday.
The agreement marks the DNC’s largest total investment in Democratic state parties to date and comes as Democrats try to rebound from significant losses in the 2024 election cycle.
Each state party is set to receive a minimum of $17,500 per month, a $5,000 increase from the current baseline, the DNC said in materials provided to States Newsroom ahead of the wider announcement.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Republican-controlled states will get an additional $5,000 a month, bringing their monthly total to $22,500. The GOP-controlled states will get that additional investment through the DNC’s Red State Fund.
The DNC’s definition for a GOP-controlled state is one that meets at least two of the three criteria: no Democratic governor or Democratic U.S. Senator; one-quarter or less of the congressional delegation is made up of Democrats; and Republicans hold supermajorities in both state legislative chambers.
As part of the agreement, the DNC said it will host six regional training “bootcamps” for state parties per two-year cycle and will also hire new staff to the Association of State Democratic Committees.
The DNC said the initiative also aims to help Democratic state parties with their infrastructure, staffing, data and tech operations as well as with organizing programs and preparation for future election cycles.
DNC Chair Ken Martin, the former Minnesota party chair who was elected to lead the national party in February, called the initiative “a historic political investment unlike anything Democrats have done in modern times” and said in a statement it is part of a long-term strategy.
“We’re putting our money where our mouth is to equip state parties with what they need to reach working families who deserve better, build long-term success all across the ballot, and gain electoral ground for years to come,” Martin said in the statement.
“Elections are won in states — and that’s exactly where we will be investing our resources,” said Martin.
Last week, Martin laid out the leadership board’s organizing principles, which centered on “organizing early, organizing always, organizing everywhere, and winning everywhere.”
“You’re going to continue to witness a level of aggressive investment and organizing from this DNC that’s unlike anything we’ve done before,” Martin wrote in that memo.
In a Thursday statement, Jane Kleeb, president of the Association of State Democratic Committees and chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said “state parties are the backbone of the Democratic Party, and through this investment, our state parties will receive the support they need to show voters that, no matter where they live, there is a strong Democratic Party in their corner, protecting their rights and economic opportunity against Republican attacks.”

20 years later

The strategy bears some resemblance to the 50-state strategy pioneered by former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who led the DNC from 2005 to 2009 and appeared on a DNC press call Thursday.
“This is a really critical move that’s being made here,” Dean said. “We have not been anything but a Washington, D.C.-centric party since 2008, and the reason that the Democrats have had a tough time is because if you’re not out there doing the grassroots politics, you don’t win. Period.”
Critics during Dean’s tenure argued that spending in deep-red areas pulled resources away from winnable races in more moderate states and congressional districts.
Asked on the press call whether the push to spread money to more states could lead to a decline in financial support to swing states, Martin said, “No, not at all.”
“I mean, as I said, there’s no such thing as a perpetual blue state or a perpetual red state, and over the years, because there’s been a lack of investment in blue states, as an example, by other partners in the ecosystem, not necessarily the DNC, it’s meant we’ve seen actually our vote share in some of the bluest parts of the country actually starting to decrease,” he said.
“I believe you have to invest everywhere and organize everywhere if you want to win everywhere, and so, that’s what this will do.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are now unwelcome across education. Under new federal guidelines and procedures (some of which were paused by a pair of court rulings last week, but only temporarily), schools, colleges and universities are being inspected for any DEI programs and policies. If the administration’s proposals stand, federal funding will be withheld to enforce the elimination of DEI.
DEI concepts promote sound educational policies and practices in public schools. Diversity requirements are protections, not guarantees. Equity ensures fair consideration for admission, scholarships and programs regardless of race or ethnicity. Inclusion means that students from all backgrounds have access to public education.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited segregation and discrimination in schools and colleges. It was not enacted to produce quotas, but to provide equal opportunities. DEI initiatives are used to enhance and preserve this legislation.
Backpedaling on these guarantees will bring us back to Brown v Board of Education and the Little Rock Nine. Most have grasped the notion that “separate but equal” is not acceptable, but bigotry and racism are still with us.
Our history should not be whitewashed or have past acts of prejudice diminished. Students hold no responsibility for the actions of their ancestors.
Analyzing historical and Constitutional cause and effect relationships creates knowledge, not guilt or remorse. It is not indoctrination to receive an unvarnished account of the progression of women’s and civil rights or learning that race is a social construct with no scientific merit.
It was illegal to educate slaves due to the fear of exposing fallacies of racial superiority. Despite the legal end of slavery and Constitutional guarantees (13th, 14th, and 15th amendments), Jim Crow laws and overt discrimination kept non-whites as second-class citizens, including limited access to education.
Students should know that white resentment triggered race riots across the country when Jack Johnson beat a white boxer (1910), destruction by white mobs of affluent black communities in Tulsa (1921) and Rosewood (1923) and bitterness from white players and fans as Black players were integrated into Major League baseball.
Effects of racism and bigotry have not been limited to Black Americans. Students should understand the systematic destruction of the Native American population and culture, and comprehend prejudice and hatred against those with Asian and Jewish backgrounds, and conflicts over religious beliefs.
Ironically, it is now illegal in some states (but not Nevada, fortunately), to teach some of the content in the three previous paragraphs. “Enola Gay” scrubbed from the picture of the plane that dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan. Really? Should the identity label “WASP” be back en vogue?
Viewpoint diversity on college and university campuses need not include opinionated nonsense; just rational, evidence-based discussions without invented facts lacking no causal relationships. Emotional expressions based on race/ethnicity or hollow concerns about gender lack academic worth.
Competence and merit cannot be determined when there is exclusion before consideration. DEI also includes accommodations for the disabled, pay equity, parental leave, having a job after the birth of a child, rejection of workplace harassment. Imagine public education without any DEI.
Is this assault on DEI warranted and will it improve student outcomes? The answer to both questions is no. So, what drives this backlash?
Described as lacking ethics and having inferior intellectual ability by his former cabinet members and government officials, the president’s push against DEI policies and practices should not be a surprise. He has exhibited life-long racist behavior and education has not always been kind to his followers.
From housing discrimination, calling for the death penalty for wrongly accused black teenagers, not wanting blacks to count money at his casinos, birther assertions against political opponents, claims of bias from a Mexican judge, Muslim bans, retweeting racist messages from white supremacists, stating white nationalists are “very fine people,” kneeling NFL players “shouldn’t be in the country,” and Haitian immigrants “all have aids,” suggesting that immigrants from Norway are superior to those from Africa and telling congresswomen of color they “should go back to the countries they came from.” This is only scratching the surface.
Reducing and eliminating DEI initiatives makes perfect sense politically. It protects a large part of his political base; undereducated white males who lack the talent and ambition to compete for positions in society. As the president declared after winning the Nevada Republican Presidential Caucus in 2016, “I love the poorly educated.”
President Lyndon B. Johnson once said, “If you can convince the lowest white man he’s better than the best colored man, he won’t notice you’re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he’ll empty his pockets for you.” 
Johnson knew all too well the white grievance that seems to be driving part of our politics today. DEI backlash is just the latest version of what Johnson saw in the 1960’s.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trump-and-mcmahon-in-oval-1024x710.jpg,,,2025-04-29 08:06:05.475916

So why did he take the New Jersey Monitor to the state Supreme Court over access to police records?,"Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop tells voters he wants to bring more transparency to Trenton. So why did he take the New Jersey Monitor to the state Supreme Court over access to police records? (Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor/Fulop photo by Reena Rose Sibayan)When lawmakers proposed gutting the state’s public records access law last year, a surprising advocate for transparency came out against that push: Steve Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City and a 2025 candidate for governor.
I say surprising because when I covered Jersey City, the city and I often tussled over access to public records. Police reports, emails between city officials, architectural records, Fulop’s work schedule … name a public record and I probably got a “your request is denied” email from the Fulop administration about it.
But, hey, I welcome any and all transparency advocates, even bandwagon-jumpers.
So color me surprised that the Fulop administration and I will be facing off in court yet again, this time at the New Jersey Supreme Court on Tuesday as Jersey City argues that it simply must withhold records the New Jersey Monitor is seeking.
This time, the record is an internal affairs report we requested from the file of police Lt. Michael Timmins, who police say fired a gun at guests during an alcohol-fueled dispute at a party at his Sussex County home in 2019 (no one was injured). Timmins was initially charged with terroristic threats and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes, a violation of the New Jersey Graves Act, which requires mandatory prison sentences for some gun crimes. But Timmins went through a pretrial diversionary program and was able to get details of his arrest expunged. Fancy that.
Police disciplinary records are not necessarily open for public inspection — but the state Supreme Court ruled three years ago that, under the state’s common law right of access, when the public’s interest in the records outweighs an officer’s confidentiality concerns, the records must be made public. I think when it comes to a cop who has a six-pack or more of beer and then fires a gun at civilians while off duty, the public’s interest in the department’s investigation of his conduct is more important than the cop’s privacy.
Another interesting fact about Timmins’ case: He was allowed to have his record expunged even though people charged with violating the New Jersey Graves Act are normally not given the option of pleading guilty to any non-Graves Act offenses. So Timmins gets a special deal and a slap on the wrist, and his expungement could give his bosses in Jersey City a chance to hide the details of his departmental discipline (Timmins was suspended for 19 days and lost another 71 days).
It’s not as if we don’t have evidence that Jersey City has already tried to hide the details of Timmins’ behavior. When the city published its annual list of officers who face discipline in 2021 but didn’t have to provide the officers’ names, it wrote about Timmins, “A member of this agency while off duty retrieved a firearm after consuming 6-8 beers. He negligently discharged a round from the firearm during a dispute.” When it later had to amend that report to include the officers’ names per a state directive, it amended it to, “Lt. Timmins negligently discharged a firearm while off duty and on his personal property.” Suddenly the city decided the public didn’t have to know Timmins had been drinking before firing his gun and that he fired it during a fight with someone.
The secrecy even extended to the lawsuit we filed about Timmins’ IA report — the city asked the trial court judge to seal all the records, so the filings in the case were, and remain, shielded from public view.
The city cannot be trusted to be honest about what happened with Timmins, so it’s up to us to find out, if the Supreme Court agrees.
Fulop campaign spokeswoman Emily Potoma disagreed with my argument that the case represents Fulop whistling a different tune on transparency than he does on the campaign trail.
“Both sides are seeking further clarity from the Supreme Court, as Jersey City prevailed at the trial court level, and that ruling was partially reversed by the Appellate Division. This is not an attempt to avoid accountability, it’s about ensuring that everyone is following the law,” Potoma said.
Except the city could have released these records back when we requested them in March 2022, before any expungement order had been issued and muddied the waters. Instead, it denied the request, moved to make all the legal briefings in our case secret, and, when it partially lost an appellate court ruling, asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. Hardly the actions of a transparency crusader.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Daisy Berbeco: Protecting human rights means defending access to health care in Vermont.","This commentary is by Rep. Daisy Berbeco, D-Winooski, ranking member of the House Committee on Health Care and member of the House Discrimination Panel.In 2022, the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, dismantling nearly 50 years of legal precedent and stripping away a fundamental civil right. Vermont voters responded by passing Article 22 to enshrine the right to reproductive liberty in our state constitution and shortly after, passed our state’s landmark shield laws (Acts 14 and 15 in 2024) which also protect gender-affirming care. In Vermont, abortion and gender-affirming care remain safe, legal, and a personal decision made between a patient and their medical provider.Shield laws provide protection from tactics that are used to harass and harm those seeking and those providing gender-affirming or reproductive care. There are currently 23 states and the District of Columbia that have shield laws related to reproductive health care, and 17 states and the District of Columbia. have shield laws related to gender-affirming care. As national attacks on women and LGBTQ+ folks escalate, Vermont continues to stand on the right side of history with compassion, clarity, and strength. With the passage of S.28, we take the next critical step: tightening and strengthening our shield law protections to ensure they are clear, enforceable and resilient.Most importantly, S.28 protects privacy. It limits disclosure of health information that could be used to criminalize legally protected care, and it creates clear guardrails around what can be shared in public records and federal investigations. These provisions send a message to patients that they are not alone. They send a message to our care providers that we care for them, too.This legislation updates our shield laws to fill important technical gaps. It ensures that if a health care provider acts lawfully in another shield state, they are protected here in Vermont. For example, if it is legal to get an abortion in New York and a doctor provides that service there, as long as it is also legal in Vermont to do that, we will protect them when they are in Vermont under our shield law.S.28 also clarifies what constitutes unprofessional conduct, including deceptive advertising and service misrepresentation, and applies those standards across all professions. Health care delivery evolves, but we must maintain high-quality, accurate and equitable access to care. In a time when other states are actively criminalizing care, Vermont is doubling down on human rights. We are saying that your gender, your identity and your health care decisions should never make you a target. We are responding to a national narrative with a different story, one where dignity, autonomy and truth still matter.We are protecting the people who need them and the professionals who provide them. That is the kind of leadership Vermonters deserve — and that is why I support S.28. I urge the governor to sign it without delay.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatments. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.
GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.










I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine, Campbell University


“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
‘Significant concerns’
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease, and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
‘Shortsighted, bad policy’
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)There’s a battle at the Minnesota Legislature this session to defend environmental standards from attacks by industry.  A bipartisan group of Minnesota legislators recently attempted to repeal the environmental rules that protect wild rice and prohibit mine waste from polluting water by rushing a bill through a committee that has nothing to do with the environment. 
Then again, on Earth Day, another attempt was made to repeal these rules. But what was so breathtakingly cynical, so beyond the pale, was that both times legislators tried to sneak these significant environmental rollbacks through by attaching them to a critical extension of unemployment insurance for laid off mine workers.
This episode epitomizes how low some will go to advance their agenda, as well as the choice facing our Legislature this session: either defend Minnesota from polluters, or join in the push to give them what they want. Minnesota legislators need to know that reducing state environmental standards — especially in this perilous national moment — is a red line that nobody should cross. 
The unprecedented blizzard of terrible ideas coming out of Washington, D.C. to accelerate mining, logging and industrial development by reducing federal environmental standards is almost certain to have significant consequences for our state. Just in the past few weeks, we’ve seen executive actions to exempt coal burning power plants from regulations; allow mining and logging in and next to the Boundary Waters Wilderness; eliminate clean water standards on PFAS forever chemicals; and slash the federal workforce that enforces U.S. environmental law. It adds up to a staggering giveaway to corporations and billionaires that will harm Minnesota’s clean air, clean water and public health.  
One of the strongest defenses we have against these reckless federal rollbacks is our suite of state environmental laws, often described by industry lobbyists as among “the strongest environmental standards” in the nation. 
When it suits them, they point to those standards as the reason we should locate polluting industries in MInnesota, because surely they will protect our environment, they argue. “Trust the process,” they say. 
But their brazen attacks on these standards — through legislative gimmicks with little to no public involvement — reveal their true aim: to advance industrial proposals, even if it means eliminating protections for clean water. 
The state mining pollution standards they now want to repeal have been litigated all the way to the Minnesota Supreme Court, which struck down the copper-sulfide PolyMet permit because of them. Millions of public dollars and thousands of hours have gone into creating and defending these critical rules that protect clean water. 
With Lake Superior and the Boundary Waters in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, this outrageous attempt to gut state environmental standards should shock everybody and compel all Minnesota legislators who claim to care about the environment to double down on that commitment. 
Mining standards are not the only place they need to hold the line. The same crowd gleefully gutting federal environmental laws across the board in D.C. are engaged in a similar project here in Minnesota, just a bit more quietly. 
Industrial interests are also attempting to weaken Minnesota’s landmark PFAS legislation and 100%clean energy law; repeal our successful solar garden program; and give environmental workarounds and lucrative tax breaks to the billionaire tech companies who want our water and energy for new data centers. 
The Minnesota Legislature has big decisions ahead that will have a direct impact on people’s health now and decades into the future. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, let’s encourage Minnesota lawmakers to do the right thing and prioritize clean water, clean air and climate justice over corporate pressure and short-term profits. 
Our response in the next month is critical. If Minnesota doesn’t stand up and defend our state environmental laws, we could lose the places and values that define our state.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Refinery.jpg,,,2025-04-29 07:05:01.429924

Some of the standards Arkansas meets are class sizes of 20 children or fewer, at least one teacher per every 10 students, specialized pre-K training for teachers and “comprehensive, aligned, supportive, culturally sensitive” early learning and development standards, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIERR), housed at Rutgers University.
Arkansas falls short in its early childhood education degree requirements and annual staff professional development, the report noted. Arkansas does not require all early childhood educators to hold bachelor’s degrees, and the state requires a minimum of 15 hours of professional development per year while the report says at least 30 should be required.
Arkansas ranked 31st nationwide in state spending on early childhood education during the 2023-24 school year, and its spending per student decreased while its enrollment of 3- and 4-year-olds in pre-K remained steady, according to NIERR’s nationwide analysis of state preschool programs released Tuesday.
The state’s preschool program, Arkansas Better Chance (ABC), serves children ages 3 and 4 from families earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level. ABC enrolled 20,311 children during the last school year, accounting for 19% of 3-year-olds and 32% of 4-year-olds statewide, according to the NIERR report.
While ABC enrollment increased by 1,063 children compared to the previous school year, overall spending decreased by more than $43 million, and spending per student decreased by $2,564, with those figures adjusted for inflation, the report states.
Federal funds helped Arkansas childcare providers stay afloat, but staffing struggles continue

Arkansas spends $2,016 less per student and nearly $41 million less overall than what the report considers “adequate” for its early childhood education landscape. The report defines adequacy as enough money to “support minimum quality standards and provide K-12 pay parity for preschool teachers within their current operating structures.”
The starting annual salary for Arkansas’ K-12 teachers increased from $36,000 to $50,000 in 2023 due to the wide-ranging LEARNS Act. This pay disparity between educators who teach 5-year-olds as opposed to 4-year-olds makes it challenging to maintain a robust pre-K workforce, early childhood education administrators told the Advocate in November 2023.
Arkansas has not implemented any “statewide initiatives or minimum set pay” to bolster the early childhood education workforce, which not only affects the overall quality of the system but also forces some preschool educators to rely on public assistance to meet their needs, Nicole Carey, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said in an interview Monday.
State spending per child enrolled in pre-K was at its lowest in nearly two decades during the 2023-24 school year, according to the NIERR report. Spending spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic but has since dropped, and it saw little change and no upward trend during most of the 2010s. Meanwhile, Arkansas’ rates of child enrollment in pre-K have returned to their pre-pandemic levels after decreasing in the early 2020s, according to the data.
“It would be great if we could have additional state investment in the ABC program, either toward educator wages or other types of workforce support,” Carey said.
Arkansas Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill this year that would have created a tax credit for early childhood educators, and a Republican-sponsored bill would have created a similar policy for “a licensed childcare provider.” Neither bill advanced.

Eleven states met nine or 10 of the NIERR standards, and none of those 11 states were “low spenders” because “money does matter for quality,” Steve Barnett, NIERR’s senior director and a co-author of the report, said in a virtual press briefing Friday.
Overall, Arkansas ranked 8th nationwide in 3-year-olds enrolled in pre-K, while 15 states do not have pre-K programs for 3-year-olds at all, according to the report. Arkansas ranked 24th in enrollment of 4-year-olds.
Additionally, 5% of 4-year-olds and 7% of 3-year-olds in Arkansas were enrolled in the federally-funded Head Start program in 2023-24, while 15% of 4-year-olds and 4% of 3-year-olds were enrolled in special education, the report states.
Arkansas has 28 Head Start locations statewide. Federal employees who administer Head Start have faced recent layoffs, but changes on the federal level have not impacted the program in Arkansas, said Leslie Taylor, spokesperson for Head Start’s Arkansas grantee, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
The state Department of Education oversees the Office of Early Childhood, which was under the jurisdiction of the Department of Human Services before the LEARNS Act went into effect in 2023. The law also required “local lead” organizations throughout the state to assess local and regional access to pre-K and what gaps or barriers should be addressed.

Most of the local lead organizations are education cooperatives, along with some school districts and child care organizations, according to the Department of Education.
AACF is “hopeful” that local leads will create “positive growth” in their areas, Carey said.

Bailey’s office issued the subpoena to Missouri Abortion Fund demanding it turn over years’ worth of documents as part of a lawsuit his office filed against Planned Parenthood more than a year ago. 
The lawsuit is based on a video published by Project Veritas which depicts a man entering a Planned Parenthood clinic in Kansas City asking for help accessing abortion for his fictional underage niece.
Missouri Abortion Fund, a nonprofit that helps financially support Missourians who can’t afford the cost of abortion, is not a party in the case, nor is the group mentioned or depicted in the Project Veritas video. 
Despite that, the organization received a subpoena on March 19 from Bailey’s office demanding it turn over any records involving minors seeking abortions, including any communications with Planned Parenthood Great Plains.
Jess Lambrecht, executive director of Missouri Abortion Fund, said while the organization believes minors should have full access to abortion, Missouri laws prevent it. Missouri Abortion Fund also does not currently pay for travel or lodging for anyone seeking financial support for an abortion, she said. 
Missouri AG sues Planned Parenthood over Project Veritas video involving fictional girl

Elad Gross, an attorney representing Missouri Abortion Fund, called the subpoena “an abuse of government power” and a “fishing expedition.” Gross ran unsuccessfully against Bailey for  attorney general last November. 
Turning over the requested documents would “impose significant burden, expense, annoyance and oppression” on the nonprofit, which is run by two full time and one part-time staff members, as well as a board of volunteers, Gross wrote in court filings.
The organization estimated it would take more than 2,900 hours to sort through the 35,000 records needed to fulfill the request. This would “substantially interfere with the day-to-day operations of Missouri Abortion Fund and impose heavy financial costs on the organization,” Gross wrote in a request that the judge quash the subpoena.
Assistant Attorney General Caleb Rutledge in court records accused Missouri Abortion Fund of “an abuse of discretion” for failing to turn over the documents in the 2-week timeline the attorney general’s office set.
At a hearing Monday, Boone County Judge J. Hasbrouck Jacobs temporarily halted Bailey’s attempt to get the Missouri Abortion Fund records. The issue has been tabled until a later date.
Lambrecht said while the judge’s decision brought some short-term relief, she still fears a financial burden in the long-term that ultimately “harms and hinders” Missourians who seek help getting abortions paid for. 
“We know that the AG’s office will stop at nothing to make accessing abortion impossible, if not exponentially difficult,” Lambrecht said after the hearing.
Jacobs on Monday also denied Planned Parenthood’s second request that the lawsuit be dismissed. 
At the crux of the case is an accusation by Bailey’s office alleging Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which oversees clinics in Kansas City and Columbia, is transporting minors out of state for abortions. 
The lawsuit was filed based on an undercover video filmed by a man affiliated with a right-wing group pretending to be the uncle of a 13-year-old in need of an abortion whose parents couldn’t know. 
The videos do not involve, reference or depict Missouri Abortion Fund.
Bailey filed the initial lawsuit in February 2024.
A Missouri teen spent her life in foster care. Now she’s fighting the state to keep her baby

At a hearing last June, Planned Parenthood also asked that the judge dismiss the case on the merits that the video was “fictitious.” The judge denied the initial request.
Last November, Missourians narrowly voted to codify the right to reproductive health care, including abortion, in the state constitution. A few months later, Planned Parenthood again requested the judge drop the case. 
The video surrounding the lawsuit remains “heavily disputed and completely hypothetical,” Planned Parenthood attorney Eleanor Spottswood said Monday. But in light of the abortion-rights amendment passing, she argued, the issue should be dropped.
“Everything the state alleges Great Plains did is now protected explicitly by the Constitution,” she said.
Lawyers with the attorney general’s office argued Monday that the issue was still relevant, in part, because Amendment 3 couldn’t be applied retroactively. 
The AG’s office also argued that the state doesn’t believe the abortion-rights amendment lifted the state’s parental consent laws for minors seeking abortions. 
Jacobs ultimately agreed. 
“My concern is over the parental rights issue,” he said.
In the video filmed at the Kansas City clinic, the man secretly taping the interaction for Project Veritas told the Planned Parenthood employees the fictional girl’s parents couldn’t know about the abortion. Staff then directed him to their affiliate clinics in Kansas where they said he could “bypass” parental consent. 
When the man asked how often girls go out of state for abortions, the Planned Parenthood employee said it happens “every day.”
A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Great Plains said last year that they do not provide any form of transportation directly to any patients, regardless of age or where they live. They also described the video, taken without staff’s knowledge, as “heavily doctored and edited.”
Missouri law, written prior to the state’s trigger law banning abortions going into place and prior to the reproductive-rights amendment passing two years later, states: “No one shall intentionally cause aid or assist a minor to obtain an abortion.”
Missouri doesn’t have explicit laws requiring parental consent for minors getting abortions in other states, nor does it prohibit minors from going to other states to get abortions.
The issue of parental rights is expected to be litigated at a future date.

Depending on what route the federal budget takes to reduce spending on the program, it could cost the state up to $16.8 billion over 10 years, according to the report from the Department of Health Services (DHS).
Medicaid — jointly  funded by the federal and state governments — provides health care coverage for low-income Wisconsinites as well as long-term care for elderly people and people with disabilities.
GOP leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives are looking for ways to cut $880 billion from programs under the supervision of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The budget plan hasn’t taken formal shape. Because Medicaid is the single largest program in the committee’s budget portfolio, however, “substantial impacts to Medicaid and other health programs are unavoidable,” the report states.
In Wisconsin Medicaid covers about 1 million Wisconsin residents up to the age of 65 for primary health care through BadgerCare Plus. It also covers long-term care for people with disabilities and the elderly under a variety of different programs. Medicaid covers 20% of state residents and 40% of births, along with 38% of Wisconsin children and 60% of state residents in nursing homes.
  Bill Hanna, Wisconsin Medicaid director
“Medicaid is an important part of our health care infrastructure,” said Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna at a DHS press conference Monday.
One possibility the report considers is a cap on federal coverage for each Medicaid patient.
Currently the federal share is 60% of the health care costs incurred by Wisconsin Medicaid recipients, with the state paying the remaining 40%. “This arrangement allows state budgets to cope with unforeseen circumstances, such as economic downturns or faster-than-expected medical cost growth,” the DHS report states.
The report states that a per-person ceiling on Medicaid costs, which Congress is reportedly considering, “would squeeze state budgets and put Wisconsin taxpayers on the hook if medical costs rise quickly, with cuts to benefits and cuts to provider payments.”
Hanna said that there remains “a lot of unknowns” in how Congress might structure a payment system with a ceiling. The report considers various scenarios under a cap, including low, medium and high increases in health care costs.
Over 10 years, Wisconsin could lose anywhere from $6.4 billion to $16.8 billion, DHS projects.
Other Congressional proposals include adding higher barriers to Medicaid coverage — primarily through a work requirement.
Work requirements have long been found to eliminate eligible people from Medicaid because of the additional burden to demonstrate that they are eligible.
“Adding an additional burden for this population will certainly result in fewer people making it through, even if they are working, just struggling with the paperwork pieces,” Hanna said.
According to the report, Wisconsin Medicaid enrolled about 191,000 childless adults per month in late 2024. Nearly half of them would be exempt from a work requirement.
“It is unknown how many people would lose coverage simply because it would be difficult to report their hours or wages,” the report states. It calculates that about 52,000 people “would be at the highest risk for losing eligibility.”
Reducing the Medicaid rolls through a work requirement, however, will carry other costs, the report argues.
“It’s not like these people disappear,” Hanna said.  “They still need care that now they just won’t have the insurance [to cover]. Meaning hospitals again will be picking up additional costs, which gets passed on to all health care consumers.”
A third approach Congress is said to be considering would reduce the federal government’s share of the cost to run Medicaid programs. That could cost Wisconsin up to $93 million, the report finds.
While congressional leaders have pointed to data on “improper payments” in Medicaid in defense of cuts and say they’re targeting “waste, fraud and abuse,” Hanna said members of Congress are  conflating two sharply different issues.
“Improper payments are not fraud, waste and abuse,” Hanna said. “Improper payments are often documentation errors that can be for any number of reasons.”
Wisconsin’s last Medicaid audit — required every three years — found an improper payment rate of 0.5%, which was due to clerical errors.
“In Wisconsin, you’re definitely not going to find significant savings” in the form of ineligible people getting covered, he said. “We have a very robust system in Wisconsin with very few errors.”
Facing substantial federal reductions, the state has four policy options, Hanna said: putting in more state funds to keep the program the same; restricting eligibility, so there are fewer Wisconsinites covered; cutting some services that Medicaid now pays for; or cutting what Medicaid pays to doctors, hospitals and other providers.
If the state pays more, then it will have to raise taxes or divert funds from other priorities. But each of the alternatives has other consequences, Hanna said.
Cutting provider rates “would have major impacts on our state’s health care system,” the DHS report states, with hospitals offsetting those by charging other payers more.
If fewer people are eligible for Medicaid, the rate of uninsured people in Wisconsin will increase, potentially driving up health care costs as well.
“Uninsured rates going up means more uncompensated care” for hospitals and other health care providers, Hanna said.
Reducing the services that Medicaid covers, however, would likely mean that people put off getting health care until an illness or condition gets worse, he said — “which ultimately means we end up spending more.”

(Mia Maldonado/Idaho Capital Sun)This story was first published by InvestigateWest on April 25, 2025.
Sheriff’s deputies in a western Idaho county will soon be able to stop and interrogate any person they believe to be in the country without authorization.
In February, Owyhee County Sheriff Larry Kendrick signed his county up for an Immigration and Customs Enforcement program that was discontinued in 2012 following multiple instances of racial profiling from participating law enforcement agencies. After taking office earlier this year, President Donald Trump reinstated the program, which President Barack Obama had halted.

Under the program, called the 287(g) task force model, local police officers are trained to work as ICE agents, acting as a “force multiplier” for ICE, according to its website. Designated officers will be able to stop and question people they believe to be in the country illegally and process them for federal immigration violations if they are also arrested on state charges.
Trump has encouraged widespread participation from law enforcement agencies across the country to help enforce his mass deportation efforts. Idaho Gov. Brad Little also issued an executive order in February that asked local law enforcement agencies to consider entering into the 287(g) programs with ICE. 
The Owyhee County Sheriff’s Office is the first agency in Idaho to have this kind of task force agreement with ICE. It went into effect Feb. 19, according to a copy of the agreement obtained by InvestigateWest. But Kendrick said his officers have not gone through training or begun participating yet in the program. Owyhee County has just 12 full-time and two part-time deputies. Kendrick said a sergeant and two deputies will likely make up the task force.
Under the program, ICE pays for any new technology needed, but all other expenses will be paid by the sheriff’s office. That includes salaries, benefits, overtime and local transportation. Previous law enforcement agencies have ended agreements due to the added costs. 
The 287(g) program refers to Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act passed by Congress in 1996. The section authorizes ICE to tap state and local law enforcement officers for some components of immigration enforcement. 
Kendrick said the county’s participation in the federal program is mostly meant to acknowledge support for Trump in Owyhee County.
“My constituents are all very conservative, and I’m conservative,” he said. “I support Trump. I support his policies. So I joined to get on board with this simply because that is what my constituents expect. That’s just supporting the Trump administration, which I do very, very much.” 
But the program’s history of abuses concerns many immigration attorneys and advocates.
“I think it is going to reduce trust in the police, reduce the reporting of crimes,” said Nikki Ramirez-Smith, a partner and immigration attorney at Ramirez-Smith Law in Nampa. 
“Nobody’s going to want to talk. Because if you witness a crime where normally you would come forward and testify, are you really going to go talk to ICE? That’s like being sent into the ICE building. I think the police need some distance from ICE if they want to do police work, which is their job, is to work with victims and perpetrators.” 
 Advocates worry about racial profiling, distrust of law enforcement

Kendrick said the agreement doesn’t mean deputies will target people for immigration enforcement who aren’t already under investigation for criminal activity. He said it will allow officers to add immigration charges to people who are arrested for drug trafficking. 
“The purpose isn’t to go out and look for illegals,” Kendrick said, referring to people who are in the country without authorization. “Here’s the thing, we have three dairies in our county, and the dairies were here even before me, and, yeah, there’s probably some illegals working there, but we’re not after them. We’re after the bad guys.”
Attorneys like Smith-Ramirez worry agreements like this alone damage the department’s relationship with the community. 
“The current political climate of fear has led, already, to a level of distrust of law enforcement,” Smith-Ramirez said. “The police departments rely on relationships to get people to talk, to get people to report crimes, to get people to trust them. And doing something like this is counterproductive.” 
A study from Texas A&M University found that law enforcement agencies who had not signed 287(g) task force agreements — but were geographically close to another agency — were likely to engage in the same racial profiling that the participating agencies engaged in. The study found the state highway patrol in North Carolina and South Carolina were more likely to stop Latino drivers than white drivers. 
Research like that concerns Smith-Ramirez who said Owyhee County has a significant number of Latino farmworkers who she worries could be caught up in the system.
“Owyhee County has a huge farming population, which means you’ve got a lot of immigrant workers who are terrified to go to work,” she said. “They’re scared to leave the house. Their kids are scared for their parents to go outside or do anything. I think it’s only going to get worse once they start doing this.”
In 2011, a federal government investigation found that under the task force model, deputies in Arizona’s Maricopa County racially profiled Latino residents for immigration enforcement and conducted unlawful searches, detentions and arrests of Latinos. A year later, federal authorities found that deputies in North Carolina’s Alamance County, who also operated as task force agents under the 287(g) agreement, were unfairly arresting Latinos and had set up checkpoints in Latino neighborhoods and pulled over Latino drivers for traffic violations 10 times more often than non-Latino drivers. Both agencies had the 287(g) agreements revoked.
“If this is happening, I would be hesitant to report a crime myself,” said Neal Dougherty, partner and immigration attorney at Smith-Ramirez Law. “I would be hesitant to advise my clients to report crimes to the Owyhee sheriff if I thought they were operating as ICE.” 
 Other Idaho counties cooperate with ICE

While Owyhee is the only Idaho county with an agreement to be trained as ICE agents, a different kind of agreement under the 287(g) program can allow local jurisdictions to hold ICE detainees in jails and to serve immigration-related warrants. 
Both kinds of agreements under the 287(g) program have grown dramatically under Trump. According to reporting from the Markup, 133 law enforcement agencies in 21 states had a form of the 287(g) agreement before the election. Earlier this month, 300 agencies in 38 states had them. 
In Idaho, three counties have the 287(g) agreements to hold ICE detainees or serve immigration warrants: Owyhee County, Power County and Gooding County. The Gooding and Power agreements have been in place since 2020. It is unclear if any other counties in Idaho will join the 287(g) program.
Even without formal agreements, some sheriffs in Idaho have defined their own process for immigration enforcement. In Kootenai County, as InvestigateWest previously reported, deputies shared the immigration statuses of people who they encountered who were not being investigated for any state crimes.  
Idaho State Police Lt. Col. Fritz Zweigart said during a media briefing that the state police have been looking into the task force model, but “right now, we’re working so well with our federal partners that we don’t necessarily need to sign into a written agreement.”
Immigration enforcement is the sole duty of the federal government, according to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, and local police may assist under federal direction. Without a 287(g) agreement, it is illegal for local police to serve federal immigration warrants and to investigate people’s immigration statuses.
Gov. Little has encouraged more coordination with ICE under 287(g). 
“To the fullest extent of the law, all State agencies with law enforcement … authority must consider formal procedures and agreements to assist the federal government in the enforcement of immigration law, including agreements under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,” his executive order said.

The draft four-year plan for Western lands proposes developing natural resources for American prosperity.
The post Leaked federal roadmap for public land called ‘industry wish list’ appeared first on WyoFile .","As the Department of the Interior develops a plan to “restore American prosperity” by exploiting Western natural resources, a Wyoming attorney who has steeled rural communities against federal policies is atop the hierarchy that will marshal the effort.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum last month appointed Karen Budd-Falen as temporary deputy secretary and his senior advisor. As the department fleshes out a four-year strategic plan to use natural resources across 19.9 million acres of national parks and Bureau of Land Management property in Wyoming, Budd-Falen will be in the Interior’s second-highest position.
A draft of the four-year Interior plan leaked to Public Domain outlines department objectives for prosperity, security and recreation. Conservationists have decried elements they say would dismantle environmental safeguards, turn over federal property, promote energy development and favor rural communities over nationwide interests.
“It is irresponsible for a media outlet to publish a draft document.” Department of the Interior
The Interior Department last week blasted the leak and called its publication “irresponsible.”
“It is beyond unacceptable that an internal document in the draft/deliberative process is being shared with the media before a decision point has been made,” Interior’s press office wrote WyoFile on Thursday. “Not only is this unacceptable behavior, it is irresponsible for a media outlet to publish a draft document.
“We will take this leak of an internal, pre-decisional document very seriously and find out who is responsible,” the statement reads.
The draft plan, which the agency said is “not final nor ready for release,” sets four goals and several objectives to accomplish them. Interior’s drafted goals are to restore American prosperity, ensure national security through infrastructure and innovation, and allow sustainable enjoyment of natural resources. It would do all that through the fourth goal — collaboration with states, tribes and local governments.
American prosperity
The draft plan to restore American prosperity would use American energy to “lower… costs and increases affordability.” But it includes elements that worry conservationists who fear damage to Interior agencies including the National Park Service, BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The plan would “deregulate” to increase “clean coal” production and oil and gas drilling. It would streamline the National Environmental Policy Act, a law designed to safeguard the environment. And it would reduce the cost of grazing, which critics say is already too low.

The draft would “release federal holdings” — divest Americans of their public property — to allow states and communities to reduce housing costs. Interior would support agriculture and increase revenues from logging, non-energy mining, and grazing. The draft treats natural resources as assets, viewing federal holdings for the economic value that can be derived from them.
The leaked document “reads like an industry wish list,” the Center for Western Priorities said in a statement. It includes “a thinly veiled reference to the seizure and sale of public lands,” according to the conservation group.
The draft treats the West’s natural resources “as nothing more than numbers on a balance sheet,” Western Priorities Executive Director Jennifer Rokala said in a statement. In the plan, those resources are “products to be sold off and exploited to help pay for tax cuts for Elon Musk and Trump’s fellow billionaires,” she said.
“It resembles a business plan from a desperate CEO, not a framework to steward public lands for the benefit of all Americans,” Rokala’s statement reads.

To her post, Budd-Falen brings years of experience fighting for ranchers and other public land users and developers. The federal government has been a frequent adversary, but so has Western Watersheds Project, another conservation group that focuses on public land grazing.
She represented a group of ranchers who sued Western Watersheds for trespassing when a field worker collected water to test for pollution caused by grazing. She advised rural counties to adopt land use plans they could leverage when contesting federal programs on public land in their areas. She also represented stock growers who sided against four Missouri hunters who corner crossed to hunt public land on Elk Mountain in Carbon County. She represented the Cliven Bundy family and others as they fought grazing reductions imposed after Las Vegas developers were permitted to occupy desert tortoise habitat. That family later became infamous for armed standoffs with federal officials over use of public land.
Conservation measures
The draft plan includes numerous other elements like supporting law enforcement, disseminating science and managing lands to reduce wildfire risk. It would reduce the federal infrastructure footprint and ensure public lands meet visitors’ needs. The draft envisions clean and adequate amounts of water.
Interior would restore historic names, some of which have been changed to recognize indigenous monikers or demote racist figures. The department would “right size” national monuments, according to the draft.

A goal to “enjoy our natural resources while ensuring they remain sound and sustainable,” includes a variety of conservation measures, according to the draft. Species and natural resources would be protected and ecosystems would be healthy and balanced, the draft said. Progress could be measured by the number of species taken off threatened and endangered lists, according to the draft.
Abandoned mines and wells would be cleaned up, the draft proposes. The department would support co-management of its properties with “local stakeholders and tribes,” the draft states.
Burgum appointed Budd-Falen “to facilitate the prompt and effective accession of the Trump administration’s leadership team,” his order states. She will serve until the Senate confirms high Interior Department personnel appointed by President Trump, but no longer than through May 31.
The timeline for public engagement is from May 16 to July 18, with publication, or final adoption, set for Oct. 1. The strategic plan is a “bold, outcome-driven roadmap for how we deliver impact to the American people,” the draft states.

Wyoming Congresswoman distorts deportation case and taunts detractors in Buffalo, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post Truth is a casualty of Hageman’s town halls appeared first on WyoFile .","Safety was the reason Wyoming Congresswoman Harriet Hageman said she put the brakes on her town hall road show a month ago in favor of virtual events.

Opinion

But when she returned in person in Buffalo last Thursday, the truth was the only thing that seemed to be in danger. Hageman, an attorney, was called out by members of the audience for telling an outrageous whopper about a deportation case, then doubling down on her false claims.
The incident demonstrated there’s nothing Hageman won’t do to defend President Donald Trump in his war against the federal judiciary and the rule of law. It also showed the political peril we’re in, when truth is continually distorted by the MAGA movement Hageman embraces.
Because of new rules that limited who could attend, Buffalo’s Bomber Mountain Civic Center was a much friendlier environment than Hageman experienced March 19 in Laramie, when many in the crowd of about 500 booed, cursed and heckled her.
Two hundred people with reservations to the Buffalo town hall signed up through Hageman’s office, according to Cowboy State Daily. No one could directly ask a question live, but queries were handwritten and placed in a box. 
The most contentious moment came after Hageman pulled out a question about whether she would pressure the Trump administration to do what the U.S. Supreme Court said it must: return a wrongfully deported Maryland man to the U.S.
The high court unanimously ruled Abrego Garcia should get the hearing he was denied before federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers sent him to a notorious prison in El Salvador.
Many in the crowd erupted in protest when Hageman bluntly said no. They asked why there was no due process in Garcia’s case.
The administration initially admitted to a lower court that Garcia’s deportation was due to an “administrative error.” An immigration judge ruled in October 2019 that Garcia, who had entered the country illegally as a teen, had “a well-founded fear” of persecution by a gang in El Salvador that had been extorting his family for years. The judge granted Garcia protection from being deported.
“First of all, [Garcia] was given due process,” Hageman said, which was met by shouts of “no.” She continued: “He went in front of two different immigration judges [who] ruled that he was a member of [the gang] MS-13. That’s due process.” 
But she inaccurately stated what happened. Garcia was detained by police after they saw him and three other men allegedly “loitering” outside a Home Depot store. Because of his clothing, tattoos and a confidential informant’s claim he was a MS-13 member, Garcia was taken into custody in 2019 by ICE.
The judges Hageman referred to both denied Garcia bail, because of the gang allegations, which remain unproven. He’s never been charged with a crime, despite Trump’s sensational claims he’s a convicted human trafficker and wife-beater. After a third judge ordered that Garcia not be deported, ICE did not appeal and he returned to his wife, a U.S. citizen, and their three children.
Hageman jumped headfirst into the rabbit hole dug by Trump and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who contend the Supreme Court didn’t order Garcia’s return.
“In fact, they reversed the district court and said [it] used the word ‘facilitate’ [his return],” Hageman argued. “I have never heard of a writ of facilitation, but oh well.”
In fact, the high court used the word when it unanimously found the lower court’s order “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.”
After trying to make her phony case that Garcia did receive due process, a  term the lawyer of course understands, Hageman’s next words were truly stunning.
“And as far as due process, I’m not sure what you are talking about or what you mean by due process,” she said, with a straight face. This wasn’t a case of legal amnesia, but an example of what earned Hageman such 
a hostile response in Laramie by taunting and dismissing her critics.
“Are you kidding me?” a woman yelled over the noise of the crowd.
Hageman stumbled. “Yes, no I’m not,” she said.
“You’re a lawyer!” the woman said.
“Yes, I am. Due process is notice and an opportunity to be heard, and he was given notice and an opportunity to be heard,” Hageman said.
No. After being given a temporary visa and work permit, Garcia spent five years in a construction apprenticeship program before being pulled over by ICE officers in Baltimore last month. He was told his immigration status had changed, and was then arrested and transferred to jails in three states before being flown with other deportees to CECOT prison in El Salvador. Like many inmates he was held in brutal conditions, never given a hearing, and believed he’d be held indefinitely.
Trump wants to keep it that way, and judging by Hageman’s responses in Buffalo, she’s perfectly OK with that. To her it’s justice.
But due process of law is much more than Hageman’s simplistic definition at her town hall. It’s a fundamental principle in the legal system that ensures fairness and justice. It serves as a safeguard against arbitrary denial of life, liberty or property by requiring adherence to established legal procedures. 
This concept is crucial for upholding individual rights and maintaining public confidence in the judicial process. Thanks in large part to Hageman and U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, who support Trump’s continued defiance of the federal judiciary, confidence in the legal process is very low in Wyoming these days.
More than 100 Wyoming jurists warned the delegation in a March 26 letter that Trump and his allies’ threats could erode the country’s rule of law.
These distinguished members of the Wyoming Bar — including a former governor and three ex-Wyoming Supreme Court justices — were insultingly called “biased, misguided” and “liberal” by Barrasso, Lummis and Hageman in a press release. The delegation said federal judges are the problem, not the president.
But as more news about Garcia’s shameful treatment comes out, it shines a bright light on Hageman’s cruel defense of Trump’s refusal to bring him home. The U.S. is paying El Salvador $6 million to keep more than 230 alleged gang members, including Garcia, who was recently transferred to a lower security prison because of his high profile.
It’s a nasty game Trump is playing in cahoots with El Salvador’s dictator, Nayib Bukele, over Garcia’s fate. Using a ridiculously narrow definition of “facilitate,” AG Bondi said, “We would facilitate [his release], meaning provide a plane.”
But Bukele vows to hold Garcia in prison forever, and Trump says he’s a terrorist who will never again set foot on American soil.  
On Friday, however, The Atlantic broke the story that U.S. officials were actively trying to bring Garcia home before their plans were blocked by Trump, who suddenly saw Garcia’s plight as a major political win in his fight with the courts over his deportation agenda.
The State Department puzzled over the sketchy evidence tying Garcia to a gang. Officials worried about his safety in prison where he could be targeted for attack. All of these concerns are valid.
Hageman didn’t need to throw Garcia, who has endured suffering for weeks and had his rights violated at Trump’s hands, under the bus. But it was red meat for her base, which can never get enough stories about how this president is supposedly leading the fight against crime.
But the truth matters, and so does the rule of law. How can we protect both when officials like Hageman turn a blind eye to justice?
Keep asking her hard questions at town halls and then vote her out of office.

Earlier this month, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Drug Enforcement Agency and FBI appeared at the Milwaukee County Courthouse with an administrative warrant to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery, and scheduled for an appearance in Dugan’s courtroom. 
An administrative warrant is not signed by a judge and does not allow agents to enter private spaces to make an arrest like a judicial warrant would. While the agents sat in the hallway outside the courtroom, Dugan told Flores-Ruiz and his attorney to use a side door. The door exits into the same public hallway and one agent rode the same elevator down to the lobby as Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer. Agents let Flores-Ruiz leave the building and then arrested him on the street. 
Last week, FBI agents appeared at the courthouse again to arrest Dugan. She’s been charged with obstructing justice and harboring an individual, both felony counts. Soon after her arrest, and before she had made her initial appearance in front of a judge, President Donald Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel were discussing the case on social media and television, accusing Dugan of being “deranged.” 
Bondi said on Fox News Friday that the charges were filed against Dugan to show the administration was willing to go after anyone, even judges, if they get in the way of their efforts to deport millions of people. Bondi said interfering with ICE agents “will not be tolerated.” 
“What has happened to our judiciary is beyond me,” Bondi said. “The [judges] are deranged is all I can think of. I think some of these judges think that they are beyond and above the law. They are not, and we are sending a very strong message today … if you are harboring a fugitive… we will come after you and we will prosecute you. We will find you.”
From the beginning, the case displayed many missteps in an effort to show force and draw attention, says Stephen Kravit, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. 
“It looks like these prosecutors are completely co-opted in Trump World and aren’t really using very good judgment. You should just look at the facts and law, and there’s just no chance they’ll be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Judge Dugan was corruptly intending to avoid a government subpoena, or that she was harboring a fugitive,” he says, calling the charges “crap.”
During the initial arrest of Flores-Ruiz, Kravit questions why DEA and FBI agents are appearing at the courthouse for immigration enforcement actions and why so many agents were needed to serve an administrative warrant. 
“It’s bad for justice on any level. They had six agents there, six to make an unarmed collar of a person who was accused of battery to his roommate,” Kravit says. “And they know he’s not armed. And there’s six of them. Two of them are DEA agents. Those are two agents not enforcing drug laws, which is what they’re charged to do. There’s no drugs involved here, OK? Two of them are FBI agents, who have 100 other different things to do. We probably only have six or seven DEA agents in the state.”
Kravit adds that the whole situation might have gone differently if ICE had gotten a warrant to arrest Flores-Ruiz from a judge rather than one “written by some guy in the office” and it’s going to be difficult for prosecutors to prove Dugan had a corrupt intent by sending Florez-Ruiz out the side door when she could have just been avoiding a “ruckus” outside her door while she’s trying to move on with the court schedule. 
He also takes offense with the way Dugan was “perp walked” out of the courthouse when she could have just been asked to turn herself in; questions why federal prosecutors didn’t bring the case to a grand jury first — which would have been the standard process — and why the country’s most powerful justice officials are discussing the case on cable news. 
“The arrest warrant for the judge is a travesty, but there’s so much reasonable doubt,” he says. “Was she corruptly trying to interrupt a government proceeding? Corruptly? Was somebody paying her money? No, or was she harboring a fugitive? That’s what she’s charged with. Did she harbor a fugitive on any set of facts that you can imagine? That’s what she’s charged with. These are serious felonies. They ruin the woman’s life and all so that Pam Bondi could make a press statement.”
Dugan’s arrest, and the attention her case has brought to ICE operating at county courthouses could have a chilling effect on Wisconsin’s justice system, Jeff Mandell, executive director of Law Forward, says. 
“I do think that there’s a chilling effect to having federal officials prowling a state courthouse to make arrests and absent real danger or exigent circumstances, it feels like that’s not a good thing,” Mandell says. “We want people in our communities to be willing and able to show up in court. We want those people to know that they can do so without feeling like they’re getting entrapped or something like that, and that’s in all of our interests.” 
For immigrants, undocumented or not, appearing in court for any reason now is a fraught decision, which could lead to witnesses to crimes not showing up to testify, Mandell says. 
“If you were just going about your day and something happened to you and this person was a witness, and you needed them to help sort things out in court and things like that, then you know, you didn’t choose your witnesses,” he says.” You didn’t decide who was going to be standing there when you were in an accident or some other misfortune befell you.” 
ICE’s focus on arresting people making court appearances puts those criminal defendants — who have not yet been convicted of a crime — in the position to decide between showing up to court and potentially being picked up by ICE or skipping their court date. Last week, the Wisconsin public defender’s office sent an email to private defense attorneys across the state advising them how to deal with clients asking about ICE operations in courthouses. 
“Explain to the client the consequences of not showing to court like you would to any client,” the email states. “Remember you cannot tell a client not to come but you can explain that ICE has been coming to courthouses and that it may no longer be a safe haven.” 
Mandell says the operations in courthouses and Dugan’s arrest are emblematic of the Trump administration’s worst impulses. 
“I think it reinforces what we’re seeing through day 98 of the administration, what we’re seeing in all kinds of ways in this administration, which is an impatience, a heedlessness, a recklessness, a disregard for norms,” he says. “That many of these folks seem to believe there’s one set of rules for them and a different set of rules for someone else.” 
“So they want respect paid to federal officials, but they are going to trample on state institutions and state officials,” he continues. “They want everyone to follow the law, but they are going to play fast and loose and cut corners, whether that’s using administrative warrants, whether that is avoiding grand juries to bring federal charges.” 
Mandell adds that when Trump was charged with felonies, he was given the privilege of turning himself in to be booked. 
“They want all of the trappings of tremendous respect for their offices, but they are not going to afford even a modicum of respect to others,” Mandell continues, “which we see handcuffing and perp walking Judge Dugan out of the courthouse without even the common courtesy of a phone call to ask if she might be willing to turn herself in, which, of course, is how the President himself insisted on all of his bookings being handled.”

The survey is meant to inform Crapo about common issues to possibly consider legislation, the senator’s office announced in a news release in March. In 2014 and 2015, the senator’s veterans’ surveys led Crapo to introduce legislation that became law, his office said. 
“A lack of affordable housing is the number one issue Idahoans raise with my staff and me in meetings across the State,” Crapo said in a prepared statement.  “Idaho is far from alone in this nationwide challenge, but Idahoans can be a key part in piecing together the housing puzzle as I continue to work to find collaborative solutions to this issue. I invite any Idahoan to complete the survey and share as much detail as they are willing and able to provide.”
For two years in a row, Idahoans have listed workforce and affordable housing as their overall top budget priority for the Idaho Legislature, according to the annual Idaho Public Policy Survey by Boise State University. Almost a third of Idahoans, 32%, listed the issue as their top state legislative budget priority. Nearly half of Idahoans, 49%, reported feeling financially strained by housing costs, the survey found.
Crapo’s affordable housing survey, available online, is open through May 31.
The survey is intended to hear feedback from homeowners, renters, insurance brokers, bankers, realtors, government officials and general contractors, Crapo’s office said.

Robin Smith, shown with members of her legal team, testified for the prosecution Monday in a federal corruption trial. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The prosecution’s chief witness in Tennessee’s political corruption case testified Monday the identities of former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff had to be “masked” because of their connection to a racist and sexist texting scandal.
On the trial’s fifth day, former state Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson explained how she, Casada and Cade Cothren met at a Nashville bar in October 2019 to plan the formation of Phoenix Solutions, a shadowy company that printed and sent out constituent mailers for lawmakers without their knowledge of who ran it. Smith, who pleaded guilty to honest services fraud in 2022 and is cooperating with federal prosecutors in the kickback case against Casada and Cothren, described the state’s postage and printing program for lawmakers as “low-hanging fruit” because it would be an instant way to make money. House members receive $3,000 in state funds to send out surveys and informational mailers, both of which must receive approval from the Speaker’s office and the director of legislative administration.
Cothren formed Phoenix Solutions in early November 2019 through the New Mexico Secretary of State’s office and created a registered agent, a method that would enable them to “mask identities” of Casada and Cothren, just months after they resigned their posts because of the texting scandal that broke open in the spring of 2019.
Smith explained that politicians are “acutely aware and sensitive” about their associates and want to maintain the “halo effect.” Thus, they had to keep Casada’s and Cothren’s connections to Phoenix Solutions secret to do business with Tennessee lawmakers.

“It was understood that I would be the least suspicious of the three to approach lawmakers,” Smith said of the business arrangement. “I was the only one that didn’t have a radioactive halo around me.”
She added that Casada “did not understand the toxicity of the scandal.”
Smith said the arrangement called for her and Casada to receive a portion of the money lawmakers spent with Phoenix Solutions based on the number of clients they brought to the company. Ultimately, lawmakers spent about $52,000 with the company from the postage and printing accounts.
A former chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, Smith played a role in Republicans taking the majority from Democrats and then winning a supermajority. Smith described herself as a “den mother” and said she came up with the name “Phoenix” from reading the Bible and Greek mythology and felt Casada and Cothren had gone through “public scrutiny” and, similarly to the mythical bird, would be rising “from the ashes.”
Smith testified after Nick Crawford, a lobbyist with Capitol & 5th Public Strategies who initially handled work done by Phoenix Solutions and its bogus agent, Matthew Phoenix, while he worked as a House Republican Caucus adviser for Chairman Jeremy Faison.
Crawford, the first person to receive a phony W-9 form signed by Matthew Phoenix, said he thought it might have been signed by a computer. He also said he was never able to speak with Matthew Phoenix by telephone or text message, only by email.
Smith pleads guilty to wire fraud connected to shadowy campaign vendor

Smith approached Crawford about directing business to Phoenix Solutions, and he recommended the company to Republican Rep. Jay Reedy of Erin and Republican Rep. Tim Rudd of Murfreesboro because he trusted Smith, who had been a key player in state politics for several years, Crawford said.
In an email, Smith said to Crawford and Cothren, “be introduced.”
Crawford, who was aware of the sexist and racist texting scandal, testified he wouldn’t have recommended Phoenix Solutions if he had known who was running it.
Smith was running a political consulting firm called River’s Edge Alliance when she won election to the House in 2018. After Casada left the speakership following a no-confidence vote by the Republican Caucus, he started Right Way Consulting.
Casada continued to serve in the House, and Smith had been named a committee chairman when the FBI raided them in January 2021. She resigned from the chairmanship, then decided to cooperate with federal authorities instead of misleading them.
Smith told the jury she repented to her pastor and family, then talked to federal agents, and added her goal is to “tell the truth” in hopes of receiving a “favorable sentence.”

(Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Getty Images)Usage of surveillance technology by law enforcement agencies in Michigan has exploded in the last decade, but a recent survey conducted by the University of Michigan found that as artificial intelligence tools are developed, law enforcement and local officials are raising concerns over privacy and accuracy.
In 2015, about 23% of local governments that responded to University of Michigan researchers’ Michigan Public Policy Survey, or MPPS, reported that their local law enforcement used body cameras. In the 2024 survey that recently was released, 77% of local governments reported local law enforcement agencies were utilizing body cameras.
Stark increases in dashboard cameras and public surveillance cameras between 2015 and 2024 were found in the MPPS too, as well as an increase in the usage of drones to 31% of jurisdictions, compared to 3% of the state’s jurisdictions in 2015.

MPPS-Spring-2024-Technology-Final 
Several local law enforcement agency heads have offered testimony to lawmakers considering additional funding for public safety in the state budget at the moment, explaining the demand for improved technology when it comes to law enforcement.
As public trust in law enforcement has been a large conversation in recent years, with Michigan no exception, demand for tools to preserve accountability is high, said Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford) earlier this month after the state house approved the additional funding for public safety. 
“If we’re going to hold our officers to a high standard and expect them to do professional policing, we have to be willing to invest,” said Harris, who served in law enforcement for more than 20 years in Michigan.
The police surveillance footage of 26-year-old Patrick Lyoya, an immigrant from the Congo being fatally shot by former Grand Rapids police officer Christopher Schurr in 2022 is circulating again this week as the trial for Schurr, who is charged with second-degree murder, begins. The footage caused public outcry for accountability for Lyoya’s death back in 2022, similar to the police killings of George Floyd in 2020 and Daunte Wright in 2021.
But while there have been clear increases in usage of surveillance by law enforcement and appetite for surveillance technology by the public, in terms of accountability, when it comes to usage of artificial intelligence technology in that sector, law enforcement and local government leaders have concerns.
About a third of leaders of local law enforcement agencies report that their departments have adopted or intend to adopt artificial intelligence or predictive technology, according to the 2024 MPPS.
Newer technology like automated license plate readers and facial recognition technology are not widely used, with 26% of agencies saying they use license plate readers and 10% reporting they use facial recognition. Only 3% of agencies said they used artificial intelligence or other predictive tools.
“AI is still in a bit of a Wild West phase,” Debra Horner, senior project manager on the survey said in a statement. “However, over a third of sheriffs and police chiefs saying they are currently using or soon to adopt predictive tools for policing and around half of prosecutors saying they at least somewhat trust AI or other automated applications for certain applications. That suggests it is a good time for the state of Michigan and individual local governments to consider developing formal regulations around transparent and responsible use of AI in law enforcement.”
The MPPS conveyed that there was interest from different levels of the criminal justice system in utilizing AI with 50% of elected county prosecutors who responded to the survey stating that at least somewhat trust AI applications that work to identify high-risk neighborhoods.
However, 66% of those county prosecutors said they were unsure if predictive policing tools made more or less accurate assessments than human-created assessments and 59% of the responding sheriffs felt the same way.
Alarm bells have also been rung by stakeholders, such as the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, or MDCR, who believe some automated technology has been programmed with racial biases across different fields, with some research reflecting that facial recognition technologies lead to disproportionate arrests of Black people.
“…all law enforcement agencies in the State of Michigan should review their current and future uses of Artificial Intelligence policing tools to determine their efficacy and tendencies to perpetuate, incorporate or facilitate bias and discrimination,” said a 2024 resolution by the MDCR.
Ferris State University Professor Greg E. Gogolin, who created the undergraduate Artificial Intelligence degree at the school, told the Michigan Advance that Michigan is not adequately creating a workforce prepared to best utilize AI or compete with other country’s expertise.
Many companies and industries want to jump on the “AI bandwagon” but few have taken into consideration that there isn’t significant investment into educating workers in this emerging technology, Gogolin said.
In the few higher education programs in Michigan that permit focuses in AI, Gogolin said many of those taking the courses are international students who will benefit industries in country’s abroad. However, he says if the state of Michigan wants law enforcement and other sectors to be versed in AI tools, it has to start with education and also an entire infrastructure to accommodate the technology.
Security on the data from the AI technology is another major concern point, Gogolin said. Michigan’s legislature is currently facing the task of legislating cyber crimes utilizing AI and the state currently doesn’t have a criminal justice system best equipped to handle the prosecution of such breaches so there is a lot of room for improvement to foster an environment prepared for AI.
Expecting law enforcement agencies to quickly be able to masterfully use AI would be similar to handing officers firearms without significant training, Gogolin said. 
“We’re not even training our own citizens, right? Expertise is growing much, much faster outside the United States,” Gogolin. “Something has to change very, very soon. Or we’re going to be so far beyond the ticking point that we’re never going to be able to catch up.”

(Photo courtesy of Richard Prodgers)The Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Yellowstone to Uintas Connection filed a federal lawsuit this month to stop a proposed pipeline corridor that would cut through six roadless areas in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest in Idaho.
The area is habitat for imperiled species like the greater sage grouse, grizzly bears, lynx, and wolverine, and the pipeline would result in a permanent 20-mile road across otherwise roadless public lands. The new permanent pipeline corridor could be used for additional pipelines in the future, and will undoubtedly increase illegal ATV use in the region.

The U.S. Forest Service authorized a special use permit in March to clear-cut a 50-foot wide, 18.2-mile-long corridor through six National Forest Inventoried Roadless Areas for construction of a private company’s pipeline from Montpelier, Idaho, to Afton, Wyoming. The decision allows a 50-foot right-of-way that will be clearcut during construction, and a permanent 20-foot right-of-way to maintain the pipeline.
In addition to the pipeline itself and the utility corridor, there will also be above-ground facilities such as valves and staging areas. But since the project violates a number of federal laws, the Alliance and Yellowstone to Uintas Connection have filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service to stop construction of the pipeline.
This pipeline would create a road through designated roadless areas, further fragments security habitat for deer and elk, and further degrades already impacted habitat for the threatened Canada lynx.
This is the second time the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Yellowstone to Uintas have sued to stop this pipeline. We filed our first lawsuit in April of 2020, and two years later the Forest Service tucked its tail and ran, pulling its decision without even waiting for a final court order. But now it’s trying again, and the simple truth is that the pipeline corridor will actually be a permanent road through national forest lands despite the fact that these public lands have been classified and protected as federal Inventoried Roadless Areas.
That means motorized vehicles will be allowed to permanently use this corridor to maintain and inspect the pipeline. Which will cause permanent vegetation removal, increased sight-lines for poaching, increased noxious weed introductions, and abundant new opportunities for illegal motor vehicle use in these currently roadless areas.
The basis for our lawsuit is that the Forest Service failed to disclose and demonstrate compliance with its own Forest Plan requirements for sage grouse. The agency also failed to analyze the cumulative effects on sage grouse as required. In this case, the Forest Service also failed to demonstrate that the new pipeline corridor is in the public interest; is compatible and consistent with other forest resources; that there is no reasonable alternative or accommodation on national forest lands; that it is impractical to use existing right-of-ways; and that the rationale for approving the new pipeline corridor is not solely to lower costs for the energy company. This violates the Forest Plan, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Forest Service Manual, the National Forest Management Act, the Mineral Leasing Act, and the Administrative Procedures Act.
National forests were designated for the benefit of all Americans, not to maximize the profits of the oil and gas industry. Instead of needlessly destroying this rare habitat for endangered species on publicly-owned lands, the private company should use existing right-of-ways or private lands.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)GREAT FALLS, WYOMING — A federal jury in Great Falls unanimously found CoreCivic liable for failing to protect a former inmate who was “nearly beaten to death” at its Shelby prison and awarded the man $27.75 million, according to court records and an account from his lawyers.
CoreCivic, a private company that manages the Crossroads Correctional Center in Shelby, said Friday it will appeal the decision.
The victim, Nathaniel Lake, was convicted of a crime he maintained he did not commit, and he was transferred to CoreCivic’s prison in Shelby, according to a news release Friday from the law firm representing him, Heenan and Cook of Billings. The Montana Supreme Court later overturned that conviction.
“While there, Mr. Lake was assaulted by another inmate serving a double life sentence without parole for deliberate homicide who had previously assaulted 11 times,” the news release said.
The original complaint filed in Toole County District Court in December 2021 said CoreCivic had been named in multiple lawsuits around the country with allegations based on “inmate injuries and deaths inflicted by other inmates.”
The lawsuit said a 2016 U.S. Department of Justice audit found CoreCivic routinely had insufficient staffing.
It also said a 2021 presidential order prohibited the DOJ to renew contracts with private prison operators, including CoreCivic, “noting that such facilities do not provide safe living or working conditions” compared to publicly operated ones.
CoreCivic maintains it takes safety seriously. In January 2025, the Brennan Center for Justice said the Trump administration reversed the order against private prison contracts.
According to the news release, the assailant “buzzed” out of his own locked pod and into Lake’s locked pod in the 2018 attack.
“He then went to Mr. Lake’s cell and beat and choked him for over 3 1/2 minutes undetected by any jailers,” the news release said. “A jailer found Mr. Lake at lockdown count and he was life-flighted to a hospital in Great Falls.”
The complaint said the assailant moved quickly, “no CCC staff intervened in the attack on Lake,” and he was allowed to “freely roam the prison between units without staff intervention.”
Lake was in a coma for 33 days and spent four months in the ICU, the lawyers said. Lake is also represented by Bechtold Law in Missoula.
The complaint said Lake had a “significant history of mental health issues” and was designated as a sex offender at the time, which made him more vulnerable to an attack.
But it said Lake maintained his innocence of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, and the news release said the conviction didn’t stick.
After being released from the hospital, Lake returned to CoreCivic for six months, but was released when the Montana Supreme Court overturned his conviction.
The complaint said the Missoula County Attorney’s Office declined to refile charges, and Lake has no criminal record.

In a statement, lawyer John Heenan said the award delivers on the request of the team’s client. The lawyers said the jury found “deliberate indifference” on the part of CoreCivic.
“In the face of a company that flatly refused to accept any responsibility for its conduct, we told the jury that Mr. Lake didn’t want sympathy, he wanted justice,” Heenan said. “The jury resoundingly rejected CoreCivic’s excuses and delivered justice.”
Based in Tennessee, CoreCivic describes itself as one of the largest corrections operators in the country. In an email, spokesperson Ryan Gustin said CoreCivic will appeal the decision.
“We take the safety and well-being of every person in our care very seriously,” Gustin said. “We respectfully disagree with this decision, don’t believe it reflects the facts of the case, and will appeal it on several legal grounds.”
The complaint said the prisoner who assaulted Lake was criminally charged with two counts of aggravated assault, pleaded guilty to the first count, and was sentenced to 15 years at the Montana State Prison with no time suspended.
Lake suffered a traumatic brain injury under CoreCivic’s negligent supervision, which had severe and permanent consequences, the complaint said: “He will likely require care for the rest of his life.”

Tate Reeves vetoed eight bills that lawmakers sent to his desk during the 2025 legislative session. 
Legislators, during their next regular session, could override the vetoes if a two-thirds majority of lawmakers in each chamber votes to do so. Such a supermajority vote is hard to attain, and veto overrides are rare. Lawmakers have only overridden one of Reeves’ previous vetoes, and that was the first override of a veto since 2002.
The governor can also line-item veto appropriation bills, but lawmakers adjourned their session without adopting a budget to fund the state government. 
Here’s a list of bills that Reeves vetoed this year:
House Bill 569 
This legislation would have changed when medical facilities were required to apply for a “certificate of need” from the Mississippi State Department of Health before opening or adding new services. 
Reeves vetoed the bill because he argued it unlawfully attempted to circumvent an ongoing court case by granting a certificate to a single psychiatric hospital in Jackson.  
House Bill 924
The legislation would have granted the Legislature’s watchdog committee the authority to conduct a review of new state agency regulations and determine if those regulations conform to what the Legislature intended for the agency to do. 
Reeves vetoed the bill because he argued that it greatly expanded the power of a legislative committee and may have exceeded the constitutional authority of the legislative branch. 
House Bill 1085 
This bill would have removed a grant program for Main Street projects in the state from under the Mississippi Development Authority, an executive agency directly under Reeves’ control, to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, an agency governed by an independent board.  
Reeves argued that the legislation was unconstitutional because it combined general legislation with an appropriation bill, which the Mississippi Constitution prohibits. The governor compared the legislation to a “duck-billed platypus that defies both logic and classification.” 
House Bill 1126 
The bill would have set a maximum local match requirement for counties and municipalities that receive Gulf Coast Restoration funds to fund projects. Currently, the Mississippi Development Authority sets rules and regulations for a local match. 
The legislation capped the local match at either 20% of the total cost or the value of one mill of taxable property in the area, whichever is less, but Reeves vetoed the measure because it mandated requirements instead of allowing an agency to set flexible rules. 
Senate Bill 2386 and Senate Bill 2867  
These two bills made technical amendments to the state’s Medicaid program, often referred to as the “Medicaid tech bill.” The main thrust of the two bills was to lock in place supplemental payment programs that have been a lifeline for hospitals. 
Reeves said in his veto message of Senate Bill 2867 that locking the supplemental payment program in place is in contradiction with another of the bill’s mandates, which would change the program to allow out-of-state hospitals that border Mississippi to participate in the supplemental payment program. 
“Complying with both requirements is a legal impossibility and places the Division, like Odysseus, between Scylla and Charybdis,” Reeves wrote. 
Reeves vetoed Senate Bill 2867 while the Legislature was still in session. Instead of overriding the veto, the Legislature passed Senate Bill 2386, a new Medicaid technology bill that addresses only some of Reeves’ concerns. The governor also vetoed that bill. 
Senate Bill 2573 
This bill would have created the Mississippi Department of Tourism, but Reeves vetoed the bill because legislative leaders failed to pass a budget during their regular session. The governor argued it would be irresponsible to create a new state agency without an accompanying budget. 
Senate Bill 2840  
This bill would have allocated money for various projects around the state. Reeves argued the bill was unconstitutional because it combined general legislation with an appropriations bill, something the Mississippi Constitution prohibits.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/04190603/Roger-Wicker-11.jpg,,,2025-04-29 07:05:01.429924

She found that many people still have soggy carpets and wet basements after more than two months. Houses are filled with mold. Trash is piled up outside. Some residents say they haven’t seen anyone from the state or federal government in their small towns offering help.
And McDowell is one of the few counties that actually received federal funding for flood response. 
In late February, the federal government approved Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s request for federal  aid. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has so far approved nearly 3,500 applications for individual assistance, and more than $25 million has been awarded to residents in Logan, McDowell, Mercer, Mingo, Raleigh, Wayne and Wyoming counties.
Residents who receive that money can use it to cover the costs of temporary housing and home repairs. 
About 94% of West Virginia communities are considered “Special Flood Hazard Areas,” which means the more than 84,000 structures in those areas are at a high risk of flooding, according to a 2023 report by researchers at West Virginia University.
However, President Donald Trump has suggested that FEMA, which is the only agency currently that administers disaster relief funds, might “go away.”
Last week it was announced that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency would cut 1,000 employees — or 20% of the workforce — from FEMA, just ahead of hurricane season.
On Wednesday, Morrisey announced that FEMA denied individual assistance grants to Boone, Cabell, Greenbrier, Kanawha, Lincoln, Monroe and Summers counties, and public assistance grants in Cabell and Kanawha counties for the February floods. 
“Despite today’s notification, I am grateful to the Trump Administration for their strong support for Southern West Virginia’s recovery following the February floods,” Morrisey said in a statement. 
We know you’re not a native West Virginian, governor, but please stand up for your adopted state.
Alex Brown from Stateline, one of West Virginia Watch’s sister newsrooms, reached out to the White House about states being denied FEMA funding, and received a statement that said the agency is focused on “truly catastrophic disasters,” and that states need to have a better “appetite to own the problem.”
West Virginia has no appetite, as shown during the legislative session.
On April 4, about three weeks after the devastating February floods, Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, proposed adding $50 million to the state budget for flood prevention. 
“We have the ability to do something earthly,” Hornbuckle said. “The power that we have — not just the divine power — but with a button and a pen that we all have to help out neighbors in the great state of West Virginia.”  
The amendment was rejected 75-19.
Remember the 2016 floods — the deadliest in the state’s history? Former Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat born in Logan County, declared a state of emergency for 44 of the state’s 55 counties.
Since November 2019, FEMA has given West Virginia more than $424 million in funding in response to the 2016 floods. More than $42 million was given to 4,949 individuals and families, and more than $172.8 million was given to local and state governments and some nonprofits. FEMA also provided more than $209.8 million to replace Herbert Hoover High, Richwood Middle, Richwood High, Summersville Middle and to relocate Clendenin Elementary.
Herbert Hoover High School was destroyed, and students were taught in portable classrooms until their new school was completed in fall 2023. Clendenin Elementary School didn’t reopen until fall 2024. Construction hasn’t started on the schools destroyed in Nicholas County. 
In response to that flood, the West Virginia Legislature created the State Resiliency Office. Its purpose is to “Minimize the loss of life and property, m​​aintain eco​nomic stability, and improve recovery time by coordinating with stakeholders to implement disaster resilient strategies.​​
The state Legislature created the West Virginia Disaster Recovery Trust Fund in 2023 with Senate Bill 677. The fund sits empty. No money was allocated to that fund during the 2024 legislative session. The FY 2026 budget, which Morrisey has signed, doesn’t include any money for the fund either. 
There were only three bills related to flooding during the session — House Bill 2858 and Senate Bill 502 were the same bill, meant to allow counties to regulate floodplains under National Flood Insurance Program guidelines. They both died. House Bill 3502, sponsored by Hornbuckle, would have allowed a one-time allocation of $100 million from the state revenue shortfall fund and $150 million from the state’s income tax revenue fund for the West Virginia Flood Resiliency Trust Fund. It died in the House Government Organization.
West Virginia needs FEMA, but with FEMA potentially out of the picture, it’s time the state whet its appetite and take a bite out of the problem. 
Morrisey has already said he plans to call a special session this summer to deal with the Public Employees Insurance Agency and education funding. Sounds like the perfect time and a good use of tax payer money to move some funding over to the West Virginia Disaster Recovery Trust Fund.

Angie Craig D-MN, speaks at a news conference on January 29, 2019 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Zach Gibson/Getty Images)Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, who has won a string of victories in the closely divided 2nd Congressional District, is running for U.S. Senate to replace Sen. Tina Smith, who recently announced her retirement.
Craig, who has represented the 2nd District since 2019, will battle Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, in what is expected to be a grueling and expensive Democratic-Farmer-Labor primary. 
The contest will split the party along ideological lines. Flanagan has long been a champion of progressive causes while Craig has garnered attention for breaking from her party on issues like law enforcement and immigration. 
Craig’s press release announcing her campaign leans on popular issues like lowering the cost of prescription drugs; stopping corporate concentration; banning members of Congress from trading stocks; and addressing the nation’s mental health and addiction problems. 
“We all know Washington’s not listening to you — and that’s got to change,” said Craig, who’s been in Washington for six years. 
In a video announcement, Craig drives a Jeep adorned with rubber ducks and speaks to the viewer while standing in front of a tractor.
She frequently refers to her upbringing in a mobile home park, raised by a single mom. She went on to become successful in the medical device industry. 
Craig is Minnesota’s first openly lesbian member of Congress and is married and has four adult sons and three grandchildren. 
She was the victim of random violence in the elevator of her Washington, D.C. apartment building in 2023, fending off the attacker with her hot coffee before escaping. 
Her campaign release uses the phrase “fought like hell” twice, once referring to her family’s battle to adopt children, and again referring to her work on “behalf of family farmers.” 
Craig’s centrist politics have helped her win four consecutive elections in the purple 2nd District in the south metro, with her margin of victory expanding until she won a blowout in 2024 despite Republicans’ nationwide success at the ballot box. She’s a vocal proponent of law enforcement, has voted on Republican-led border security bills and is the top Democrat on the House Committee on Agriculture. 
In recent months, Craig seemed to be making moves to appeal to the DFL’s progressive base, perhaps in preparation for a statewide run. She invited Denise Specht, president of the state’ influential teachers union Education Minnesota, to be her guest at the State of the Union address. She joined with well-known progressive Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, to form a new caucus, known as the Monopoly Busters Caucus. 
A spokeswoman for Flanagan sought to draw a contrast, though without naming Craig. 
“In Peggy you have a lifelong Minnesotan who has spent her entire career fighting for and delivering economic wins and stability for kids and families. And she’s building a formidable campaign powered by actual people, not corporations,” said campaign spokeswoman Alexandra Fetissoff.
Flanagan announced her bid for Senate in February. Last week, she released a list of endorsements from lawmakers in Craig’s district, including DFL state Sens. Lindsey Port and Erin Maye Quade, and Reps. Kristi Pursell, Jess Hanson and Mary Frances Clardy. She’s also won the endorsement of Attorney General Keith Ellison, former U.S. Sen. Al Franken and State Auditor Julie Blaha. 
Craig’s departure in the 2nd District is expected to set off a competitive race to replace her — on both sides. Potential candidates include 2024 GOP nominee Joe Teirab; 2020 and 2022 GOP nominee Tyler Kistner; DFL state Sens. Matt Klein and Erin Maye Quade; former state Sen. Matt Little; and Minneapolis businessman and internet impresario Mike Norton.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/minn.-craig.jpg,,,2025-04-29 06:00:33.008936

Glenn Youngkin's request that he drop out. (Photo courtesy of John Reid)Things aren’t always what they seem to be, especially in today’s online realm.
A “friend request” appeared in my Facebook notifications last week that I immediately recognized as phony. It purported to be from a real-life friend I’ve known for more than a quarter of a century. It used his real name and photo, but it had only 16 friends, not his more than 2,000 online friends, including me. So I reported the sham account to Facebook and texted my friend, who knew about it and had already alerted Facebook. The fake “friendvite” was one of many I reject and report every week.
In deepening Va. GOP crisis, Reid accuses Youngkin PAC of extortion. Is a legal battle ahead?

Having a large social media following is not unusual for people like my friend, who spent most of his career in the public eye during decades of distinguished service at top levels in state government. They’re also prime targets for digital impostors.
The very next day, another friend of mine — longtime Richmond morning radio talk show host and Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid — was the focus of lurid accusations stemming from posts on a dubious social media account.
A page on a platform known as Tumblr used a name that matches Reid’s usernames on other social media. The story was first reported Friday in The Richmonder by former Mercury reporter Graham Moomaw, who viewed the images before the Tumblr page was taken down. The story said the pornographic pictures of men were reposted, random photos that had appeared elsewhere. Reid was in none of them.
Reid is the first openly gay candidate for statewide office in Virginia history. I’ve known him for the better part of 30 years, and he’s never hidden his orientation from anyone. People who know him know that he’s eight years into a committed, monogamous relationship.
I am not privy to all the facts, but there’s more than enough reason to be highly skeptical of what has all the earmarks of a clumsy, hateful political takedown. It’s also clear that a quarter of the way through the 21st century, some people will do anything to keep a gay man from being part of the most diverse ticket in Virginia history alongside the first Black woman and Hispanic man elected to statewide office.
This was already a difficult year for Republicans. President Donald Trump has lost convincingly all three times he’s been on a Virginia ballot. The GOP is winless in every statewide election when he was either president or a candidate. His second administration’s chainsaw approach to severing federal employees and contractors who are a significant part of Virginia’s economy makes this year’s climb steeper.
The GOP caught a break by avoiding primaries for statewide office. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, running for governor, and Attorney General Jason Miyares, running for reelection, secured their nominations weeks ago. On April 21, Reid became the default lieutenant governor nominee when longtime Fairfax County Board of Supervisors member Pat Herrity withdrew citing health concerns.  
That’s when the threats began, Reid said in a Monday interview with the Mercury.
“Then I got a call from a religious group in Henrico saying, ‘We’re warning you that your life is going to be ruined, so don’t run,’” he said. “Yesterday, they told my campaign guy that if I step aside, this will all go away.”
If that sounds to you like blackmail talk more befitting mob bosses than political operatives, you’re not alone.
“I think they — not everybody but some people — decided they don’t want a gay man on the ticket after the primary didn’t work out the way they expected. They thought that Pat would crush me in money and in northern Virginia votes,” Reid said.
Leading the chorus of Republicans pressuring Reid to retreat is Gov. Glenn Youngkin, whom Reid has unabashedly supported and who was often a guest on Reid’s dominant Richmond region morning radio talk show on WRVA.
I know from bitter personal experience the disastrous consequences of being insufficiently skeptical; of feeling time-pressured to believe a finding rather than awaiting a fuller accounting. Has Youngkin done the same thing?
Imagine you’re a well-known media personality who also has a significant portfolio of service to Republican causes and officeholders. You effectively live in a glass house. Now ask yourself: Would I, in such a situation, post X-rated pictures of strangers on a social media account under my own username? In what world is that sane? At a minimum, it should give you pause.
I wonder, governor, where was your indignance over the lewd behavior of another Republican who once bragged on a hot mic of taking grossly indecent liberties with women, including grabbing their genitalia? Or over unwanted sexual advances against writer E. Jean Carroll for which a New York jury held him civilly liable for battery and defamation. Or over his conviction on 34 felony counts by another New York jury on charges he paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election to silence her claim that the two had sex years earlier.
Did you ask him to abandon his nomination for the presidency, an office he has now won twice? Did it occur to you or your political advisers that the questionable claim against Reid could plausibly be one of those innumerable spoofed accounts that get generated every day by overseas bot farms, soulless scammers and, in the instant case, possibly a few ethically bankrupt political schemers? How much investigation preceded your demand that Reid quit the race? Would you have similarly sandbagged your party’s nominee if that person had been heterosexual?
I have always respected Reid. I don’t agree with all of his politics, but there’s no Democrat with whom I share full concurrence, either. He has always been unflinchingly conservative. He’s never shied from asking tough questions or answering them from others, either as a political aide or as a broadcaster. Nothing he’s ever told me turned out to be a lie, and I can’t say that about many in the realm of politics.
I don’t know how all of this winds up, but history won’t be kind to those who orchestrated or advanced this Machiavellian ambush. As Reid told me, it’s not all Republicans. Many of them have recognized this underhanded play and rallied behind him, as the Washington Post reported from Reid’s campaigning in Virginia’s reddest congressional district over the weekend.
I also know Reid is defiant, hurt, angry and not backing down. He has engaged lawyers to look into what he flatly calls extortion, a felony. He might have a civil defamation claim, something that could compel interesting answers in sworn depositions.
Those who figured Reid would falter and meekly fade away figured wrong. Now they’re in a fistfight of their own making.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)All of Virginia’s educational divisions, except two, have signed Title VI certifications pledging their commitment to treating all students equally regardless of their race, following a mandate by the state education department that builds on President Donald Trump administration’s campaign to demolish diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in federally-funded agencies. 
Two school divisions — in Loudoun and Fairfax, the state’s largest school district — submitted alternative documents that they say signify the same commitment, flouting the certification form created by the U.S. Department of Education. Norfolk signed a modified certification form.
Schools could lose federal funding and face further investigation if they don’t comply with the certification, federal leaders have said.
George Mason, Old Dominion latest Va. universities to roll back DEI policies

Loudoun County Superintendent Aaron Spence wrote a letter to the Virginia Department of Education explaining the division would not sign the certification because  it already has policies to ensure Title VI compliance, so “it is not clear what purpose the requested certification serves.” 
“We believe we have complied with the intent of the requested certification by providing the necessary assurances to the Department of Education—both at present and during our annual grant applications, as required by federal law,” Spence said in a statement. “The letter we submitted to the VDOE was intended to fulfill this purpose while also highlighting our concerns regarding the lack of clarity created by the certification document itself.”
Loudoun County schools also published a letter to parents stating that the division has already certified its compliance when applying for federal funding and claiming that the federal agency’s request is also “vague” and “overly broad.” 
Spence said the school division will await further guidance, since courts in New Hampshire and Maryland recently issued injunctions on the collection of information regarding diversity, equity and inclusion programs. 
Fairfax schools sent both a modified certification and assurance document and said in a statement to the Mercury that the school division’s policies continue to be “consistent with all applicable state and federal laws.”
Last week, Fairfax Superintendent Michelle Reid reinforced this by certifying the division’s compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to state education leaders.
“Here in FCPS, we believe our diversity is a strength and that each and every child deserves access to a world-class education,” Reid said in a statement to the Mercury. “The power and promise of public education come to life every day in our schools through the tireless dedication of our staff and the transformative moments of learning that our students experience.”
On April 3, the U.S. Department of Education required the Virginia Department of Education to certify each school division’s compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the responsibilities outlined in the Students for Fair Admissions vs. Harvard case — or risk losing federal funding assistance.
According to records obtained by the Mercury, VDOE’s deadline to submit a report with all of the certifications was extended to April 24.

The agreement stated that the U.S. DOE “will not initiate enforcement action, investigation or otherwise take action” based on any state or school division’s certification, lack of certification, or communication with the federal agency regarding the certification until after the April 24 deadline has passed.
Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for Civil Rights, said in an April 3 statement that federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right. 
“When state education commissioners accept federal funds, they agree to abide by federal antidiscrimination requirements. Unfortunately, we have seen too many schools flout or outright violate these obligations, including by using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics in clear violation of Title VI,” Trainor said.
The administration’s efforts are facing fierce pushback from the National Education Association as well as civil rights groups including the NAACP. On April 24, a federal judge in Maryland temporarily blocked enforcement of the federal education department’s certification directive, and the same day, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted an injunction to the same effect.

[…]","The North Carolina Legislative Building (Photo: Clayton Henkel) For average citizens whose knowledge of the lawmaking process stems mostly from snippets of TV coverage of Congress, a grade school field trip, or attendance at a city council or local school board meeting, witnessing the machinations of the North Carolina legislature up close and personal for the first time is often a surprising experience.
A congressional committee’s vetting of a single bill often takes more than one meeting of several hours each and features panels of expert witnesses reading pages of lengthy and painstakingly prepared testimony, often followed by lengthy questioning and speech-making from lawmakers and committee staff.
City council and school board gatherings may not be so grand or highfalutin, but they often run late into the night as constituents come forward to oppose or support a proposed ordinance or policy change.
In contrast, the process in Raleigh is almost always remarkably quick and informal.
Indeed, a typical General Assembly committee’s public consideration of a bill – even a proposal of some substance and controversy – often takes just a few minutes. A committee meeting might proceed as follows:
First, the members of a committee gather at an appointed one-hour time slot. The meeting often takes place in a small, crowded, sometimes windowless and spartan room that features a narrow horseshoe of tables for lawmakers to sit at arm-to-arm, and a few rows of general seating for the public and media members. Often, legislators trail in after the proceedings have commenced and depart early.
And for the next 50-or-so minutes, the committee chair leads the group of perhaps 10-20 members through the list of scheduled bills. One-by-one, bill sponsors troop to the front of the room, explain the bill in a couple of minutes – sometimes accurately, sometimes not so much — and ask for support. During busy times of the year – like the current silly season that’s underway right now – each meeting’s agenda could include as many as a dozen or more bills.
Sometimes, there are a few questions, comments or a bit of professional staff input, sometimes not. Often, the legislation — almost all of which is sponsored by Republicans since Democratic proposals seldom get a hearing in the GOP-dominated legislature – will be approved on a voice vote in just a minute or two.
Occasionally, a member of the public – a lobbyist, a government agency staffer, an average citizen – will ask to speak. Sometimes they will be granted permission – often with an air of impatience from the chair — and sometimes not. Normally, while they are speaking, a sergeant-at-arms staff person will hover close by, assuring that they do not exceed the time allotted to speakers – usually just two minutes, or sometimes one
Speakers who oppose bills favored by the chair tend to get a faster hook.
Sometimes, amendments or rewritten versions of bills known as “committee substitutes” will be hastily crafted and adopted on the fly. At other times, bills are quickly okayed with a vague proviso directing staff to incorporate “clarifying” amendments before the bill goes to the floor, or when it gets to another committee.
And that’s basically it.
That’s how important and frequently complex new state statutes – statutes that create new crimes, alter which toxic chemicals are and aren’t permissible to release, or amend what can and can’t be done in public schools – are vetted.
And right now, as lawmakers hurtle toward their self-imposed May 8 “crossover deadline” – the date by which many bills must be approved in one house in order to be eligible for consideration in the other one this year – the process is at what is arguably its chaotic worst. In the coming days, look for scores — perhaps hundreds — of bills to be summarily whisked through committee and House or Senate floor votes based on little more than a sponsor’s general description and the hope that the other house may figure out a way to pay more attention.
As the old saying goes, it’s a crazy way to run a railroad. Whether, however, there is a better and truly feasible way to run things is very much an open question.
A legislature that lacked artificial deadlines would presumably have more time to dissect legislation, hear from genuine experts, and better understand what it was voting on – as might a legislature that committed to listening to public testimony for more than 60 or 120 seconds at a time. Mandating detailed explanations from professional legislative staff for every bill considered and requiring a week’s public notice before a bill could be considered would help as well.
But, of course, remedies that promote transparency, hard questions and public input tend to take more time, drive up costs and, most importantly, diminish the power of the people running the show behind the scenes. So don’t hold your breath.
For now, the best chance for many important bills to receive something closer to the thorough vetting they deserve likely rests with the Gov. Josh Stein and, ultimately, the chance that Democrats on Jones Street will stick together long enough to make any vetoes he might issue stick. Stay tuned.

(Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)Ohio lawmakers appear to have a deal on a wide-ranging energy bill meant to increase power production in the state. They’re returning from a two-week recess with an amendment sanding off the differences between House and Senate proposals approved last month.
The Senate Energy Committee meets Tuesday to introduce the changes and likely put them to vote. Both chambers will be in session the following day and could presumably vote on final passage in back-to-back sessions.
The proposal offers tax breaks for companies investing in power plants and retools the ratemaking process for energy distribution companies. To further encourage new entrants, the measure reinforces barriers keeping the regulated monopolies running distribution out of the production market.
Where the tweaks land
From the outset, House and Senate lawmakers have worked along parallel tracks advancing similar, although not identical, versions of the same bill. Several core ideas have persisted throughout, like eliminating the coal plant rider from 2019’s HB 6.
Along the way, lawmakers proposed a few sideline initiatives. The House bill included a pilot for small cooperative power generation facilities; the Senate added in a program loaning schools money for renewable energy improvements. The Senate’s idea survived. The House’s didn’t.
For other provisions, the chambers offered different responses to the same question. The proposals incentivize investment with a tax break. Tangible personal property tax gets levied on the equipment used to generate electricity. The House proposed reducing the rate from about 25% to 7%. Senators meanwhile suggested eliminating it altogether for equipment brought online after 2025.
The amendment goes with the 7% mark and includes provisions to discourage companies from claiming the reduced rate after making modest changes or upgrades to existing facilities.
Another major element of the legislation has to do with the regulatory timeline. Critics argue Ohio’s ratemaking process takes longer than most other states, so lawmakers proposed a “shot clock” for those decisions. The House set the ceiling at 360 days, but the Senate’s 320-day deadline is the one carried forward in the amendment.
Cutting room floor
A last-minute change to what qualifies as a ‘major’ facility isn’t included in the amendment. House lawmakers lowered the cut-off for electric transmission lines to put more of them under the Ohio Power Siting Board’s authority. Critics argued those investments get very little oversight and offer a path for utilities to over-charge customers for the upgrades.
Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis is urging lawmakers to “reconsider” a different provision related to consumer refunds.
“When we say ‘reconsider’ we mean delete it,” her written testimony states.
If the state Supreme Court determines a charge was unlawful, the legislation allows consumer refunds for any of those charges collected after the court decision. Willis questioned the idea of barring refunds on charges determined to be illegal.
What’s more, she argued “it may have the unintended effect of interfering with consumer refunds in pending appeals where charges have been collected ’subject to refund.’”
One such case against Dayton-area AES Ohio is currently working through the appeals process. Because state regulators approved a $76 million charge — subject to refund, the Consumers’ Counsel case could return more than $300 to each customer. But if the amendment’s cut off is in place, those refunds would be in jeopardy.
“The current refund provisions risk perpetuating past injustices where consumers bore the cost of unlawful utility charges without remedy,” Willis wrote.

Jockey Club data shows the number of Thoroughbred races run in the United States has dropped by more than 50% since 1995, and the size of the national foal crop has been falling even faster, from 34,358 in 2007 to an estimated 16,675 last year. The Sonoma County Fair recently announced it will forego live racing for the first time since 1936 because of a shrinking supply of horses in Northern California. Last month, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled the state’s historical horse racing machines unconstitutional, prompting Churchill Downs Inc. to project a 25% cut in purses at its Fair Grounds racetrack.
 Slots-lite a double-edged sword

Meanwhile, “decoupling” legislation that could free Florida gaming operators of the obligation to stage live racing as a condition of their licenses has been stalled, but may only represent a temporary reprieve from redevelopment of major tracks. The Stronach Group’s 1/ST Racing, which owns Gulfstream and Santa Anita, has threatened to sell both tracks while showing a pronounced inclination to divest rather than invest in its properties. Last year, the company closed Golden Gate Fields near San Francisco and cut a deal that turned over Baltimore’s Pimlico, the home of the Preakness Stakes, to the state of Maryland.
Against this gloomy backdrop, and in contrast to its own contentious closure of Arlington Park near Chicago, Churchill Downs Inc. continues to spend aggressively on its flagship track. Plans for new capital projects with a projected cost of $920 million were put on pause last Wednesday, ostensibly in response to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and trade disputes,  but recent improvements to the paddock and the addition of Homestretch Club and Turn One Experience cost in excess of $300 million and speak to management’s long-term bullishness.
While these investments are largely attributable to the singular appeal of the Kentucky Derby, they also reflect the thoroughbred industry’s political influence in Frankfort and, in turn, the gushing revenue stream historical horse racing (HHR) terminals have unleashed.
Since their 2011 introduction at Kentucky Downs, the slot-like historical horse racing terminals have reinvigorated racing in the state. Programmed to pay out based on the results of races previously run, Kentucky’s HHR machines generated more than $9.6 billion in handle during the 2024 fiscal year, accounting for $99 in bets for every $1 wagered live at the state’s thoroughbred and standardbred tracks.
They contributed $55.5 million to Kentucky’s Thoroughbred Development Fund during that 12-month period, fueling the growth of purses that have more than doubled since 2017. Consequently, Eric Hamelback, CEO of the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, refers to HHR’s proliferation as racing’s “golden ticket.”

When HHR’s legality was challenged in 2018, Ellis Park General Manager Jeffery Inman said the loss of that revenue would “likely threaten the very survival of one of Kentucky’s iconic racing venues.” Though opposition was vocal, it was handily outvoted. Attorney Ryan Roark, in an article published in the Kentucky Law Journal, wrote that the legislature settled on a definition of pari-mutuel wagering “not shared by anyone outside Kentucky … to allow for the powerful horse industry to exclusively run their slot-like gaming systems.”
The result, says Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen, has been a “juggernaut.” According to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, gross HHR commissions for Churchill Downs’ two Derby City Gaming locations exceeded $224 million for the 2024 fiscal year, nearly 12 times the total commissions from on-track wagering at all of the state’s racetracks.
To the extent this disparity underscores the industry’s reliance on revenue sources that require no physical horses, it inevitably raises questions about racing’s sustainability and the best use of its real estate.

“Racing is on life support in Southern California, Florida, Delaware, Pennsylvania etc. and exists almost everywhere else only with the support of non-racing revenues from slots, casinos and state supplements,” Kenwood Racing founder H. Robb Levinsky wrote in a January letter to Thoroughbred Daily News. “Instead of embracing innovative ideas to make the sport more attractive to a new generation of racing fans and owners, the focus continues to be on protecting those non-racing revenues. An industry where 80-90% of purse money comes from slots instead of wagering on the core product is simply not viable in the long run.”
 Signs of progress in New York, Maryland

In the short run, at least, the growth of Kentucky’s purses has led to a higher quality of horses competing in the state, more interest among bettors and a breeding boom running contrary to national trends. As Ed DeRosa documented for Horse Racing Nation, Kentucky passed both California and Florida in total handle in 2024 after trailing both states annually since 2007.
“We’re the only jurisdiction (among the top four states) that has grown since 2020,” said Chauncey Morris, executive director of the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association. “The rest have contracted.”
And as cash incentives for Kentucky-breds have increased, so has the state’s share of registered foals. When HHR was introduced at Kentucky Downs in 2011, Kentucky produced 29.2% of the national foal crop. In 2023, the most recent year for which statistics are available, it was 42.2%.
  Damon Thayer (LRC Public Information)
“In states where racing has a good relationship with state legislators, racing is in good shape,” said consultant Damon Thayer, formerly the Kentucky Senate’s majority floor leader. “In states where they have not cultivated a long-term relationship with the legislature, horse racing is either in a declining state, a crisis state or a questionable state.”
In addition to Kentucky, there are pockets of progress. New York and Maryland have committed nearly a billion dollars to renovations at Belmont Park and Pimlico. Multiple industry executives cited developments in Wyoming, the nation’s last populous state, as a basis for bullishness. Yet their optimism is tempered by unsolved problems in larger locales, including the most populous state, California.
Without supplemental income from other forms of gambling, California’s racing and breeding businesses have been contracting for decades. Efforts to enhance purses through HHR remain at the discussion stage in view of Native American tribes’ virtual monopoly on the state’s casino gaming. Unless some accommodation can be reached, racing columnist Ray Paulick warns, “racing in California is history.”
“You can put 1,000 HHRs in at Santa Anita and it would change California racing overnight,” Thayer said. “They’d be wildly popular. You’d direct the money to purses and breeders reward programs and it would be a huge success. It seems like some sort of attempt should be made to cut a deal with the Indians and convince them that 1,000 HHRs at Santa Anita is not going to damage their land-based casinos. . .
“Like Cyndi Lauper used to say, money changes everything.”

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”











It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state.


– David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst



Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
‘Generational change’ to taxes
While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Blue and red states slash taxes despite warnings of hard times ahead

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
An uneven tax burden
Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

As outside temperatures dropped to the low- to mid-teens Fahrenheit on Feb. 10, 2025, two children died of carbon monoxide toxicity in a family van parked in a Detroit casino parking garage.
We are political scientists who study urban and housing public policies, and in the months since this tragedy, we took a deep look at the trends in homelessness and housing policies that foreshadowed the events of that night.
 More kids are experiencing homelessness

One important trend is that the number of homeless children in the city reached a record high in 2024. This is true even though the overall numbers of people experiencing homelessness in the city is declining overall. 
According to the Point-in-Time count, 455 children were experiencing homelessness in Detroit on Jan. 31, 2024, up from 312 the year before. The count captures data for one night each year.
Most of these children were unhoused but considered sheltered because they had a place to sleep in an emergency shelter or transitional housing, or were able to temporarily stay with family or friends.
Nineteen of the kids were unsheltered – meaning they were sleeping in places not designed for human habitation, like cars, parks or abandoned buildings.
A different set of data comes from the Detroit Public Schools. The district looked at the entire 2022-2023 school year and found that roughly 1 in 19 students were unhoused at some point during that nine-month period — more than double the number in the 2019-2020 school year.

 A lack of temporary solutions

The lack of adequate funding and staffing in the city’s shelter system means unhoused people often struggle to access temporary shelter beds.
That includes kids. Even though the city prioritizes giving beds to the most vulnerable, the number of unsheltered children of school age has nearly tripled in three years, rising from an estimated 48 in the school year beginning in September 2019 to 142 in the school year beginning in September 2022. These figures align with the rise in unsheltered children recorded in the one-night Point-in-Time count, which increased from four in 2016 to 19 in 2024.
The end of COVID-era funding that prevented many evictions is likely to increase the need for shelter and put additional strain on Detroit’s response to the crisis.
 Gaps in a vital system

Children who experience housing insecurity are often caught in the middle of bureaucracy and failed regulation.
The mother of the children who died in February had reached out to the city in November 2024 when they were staying with a family member. The mother noted that she wanted to keep all five of her children together.
According to a report issued by the city, the Detroit Housing Authority did not follow up with her. Her situation was not considered an emergency at the time of contact since she was sheltered with family.
At the time of the call, the family was a Category 2: immediate risk of homelessness – in other words, not the highest priority under the emergency shelter grants guideline. If the city had deemed the situation an emergency, protocol would be to dispatch immediate support for the family.
The mother moved her family to the van after the request for help failed to provide a solution.
The Detroit mayor’s office admitted that the family fell through the cracks and promised to expand available shelter beds and require homeless outreach employees to visit any unhoused families that call for help.
“We have to make sure that we do everything possible to make sure that this doesn’t happen again,” Deputy Mayor Melia Howard told local media.
 More than 8 in 10 placed on wait list

According to records from the Coordinated Assessment Model Detroit, the system responsible for connecting individuals to shelters, 82% of calls do not result in immediate help but rather being placed on a shelter waitlist. Similar to instances across the country, the wait time is long.
Families in Detroit face an average wait of 130 days, while unaccompanied youth typically wait around 50 days.
The long wait for shelter has contributed to the rise in people living on the streets or in their vehicles. The number of unsheltered individuals — including both adults and children — doubled from 151 in 2015 to 305 in 2024. This trend of increasing unsheltered homelessness contrasts with the overall decline in the total number of homeless people in the city, which is down from a peak of 2,597 in 2015.

Children need safety and security to thrive.
Their access to stable housing depends on their parents and what the adults in their life are able to provide. As rents increase in the city, some children are left vulnerable.
 Stricter regulations

Over the past decade, Detroit, like many other U.S. cities, has experienced rising housing costs while wages fail to keep up, particularly for long-term residents.
Since 2021, the number of rentals in the city has increased by 51%.
Rents are also up. Since 2017, the average rent in Detroit has increased 55% for single-family homes and 43% for multifamily homes.
While inflation and increased maintenance costs contribute to this rise, stricter rental regulations like the heightened enforcement of housing codes, expanded tenant protections and higher compliance cost for landlords have played an important role.
Some landlords pass the expense of these regulations on to tenants, making housing less affordable. Others leave their properties vacant, pushing up prices by lessening the supply.
The current average fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Detroit is $1,314 per month. For the typical household in the city, this basic shelter cost, not including utilities, makes up 41% of the household income.
For the lowest-income households, any unexpected expense can disrupt a delicate financial balance and lead to eviction and homelessness. Children in these situations often face major instability, moving between shelters – or, as in the case of the children who died in February, sleeping in cars.
This kind of displacement disrupts education, strains mental health and increases exposure to danger.
Detroit’s stricter housing regulations may have improved conditions for some renters, but a report by Outlier Media shows that only 8% of landlords are in compliance, leaving legacy residents in subpar rentals at higher prices.
And these new rules have victims who are too often ignored until tragedy strikes.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) The Legislature’s Transportation Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing Tuesday afternoon for a swath of bills related to the Maine State Ferry Service, which has been wrestling with staff shortages, cancellations and other disruptions in recent years.
Last summer, leaders from six island communities wrote to Gov. Janet Mills asking her to help address the frequent ferry service cancellations, which were due in part to ongoing staffing challenges. The state ferry service connects six Midcoast island communities to the mainland. 
The Maine Department of Transportation also raised fares for the first time in five years last August. Though service reliability reportedly improved by the fall, the department was considering another fare hike this coming summer. 
While two of the proposals before the Legislature seek to expand the services to Matinicus Isle and Monhegan Island, there are multiple bills trying to address the operational issues that have plagued passengers in recent years. 
There are also proposals looking to address where ferries are docked each night, such as a bipartisan bill from House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor). LD 1231 would require the department to dock a ferry that carries vehicles overnight in Swan’s Island, Vinalhaven, North Haven and Islesboro for emergency medical, fire and law enforcement needs. 
The bill was introduced after the ferry service announced late last year that it was considering docking all of its ferries on the mainland overnight and instead providing emergency boats to serve the islands during that time. This potential shift from the decades-long practice of having boats spend the night at island ports to help islanders with medical emergencies reach hospitals raised concern among residents. 
The Hancock County Emergency Management Agency submitted written testimony in support of LD 1231, saying that having a ferry overnight on Swan’s Island has been “beneficial in innumerable instances over the many decades, aiding in all public safety operations to and for our at-risk, Hancock County offshore island communities of Swan’s Island and Frenchboro.”
Rep. Ann Matlack (D-St. George) will have a related bill before the committee that would allow a ferry to dock overnight at an island port or the mainland, while allowing the department to require a vessel to dock in a particular location for an emergency situation such as extreme weather. 
Increasing oversight and staff stipends
Several lawmakers are introducing proposals to increase oversight of ferry service operations, which are currently subject to an advisory board made up of one person from each of the islands served by the ferry service and three members representing the mainland communities. 
One bill, LD 1680 introduced by Rep. Holly Eaton (D-Deer Isle), would establish an independent committee that would be charged with ensuring accountability and transparency around key decisions for the ferry service. 
Similarly, Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock) is introducing legislation that would require the ferry service to consult with the Maine State Ferry Advisory Board, which advises the Department of Transportation on matters related to the service, for budget matters, strategic planning and major operational decisions. LD 1731 would also require the ferry service to provide regular reports to the advisory board for review and feedback. 
As for the employee recruitment and retention issues that have plagued the ferry service, Rep. Michael Ray (D-Lincolnville) is proposing an annual stipend to all employees starting January 2026 equal to $5 per hour for the total hours worked in the previous year. LD 1268 also stipulates that the department can’t raise tolls to pay for the stipend. 
This comes after the department has already implemented other stipends and incentive programs providing up to $4,000 in bonus pay and increased overtime for ferry crews to combat the staff shortages. Workers have said they can make more money crewing ferries elsewhere, so there’s little incentive to stay and work in Maine.
Sen. Anne Beebe-Center (D-Knox) has a bill seeking to offer lifetime ferry passes for retired state ferry employees. LD 280 would provide two round trips per month for a passenger and a vehicle. 
The transportation committee is also scheduled to hear from Rep. Gary Friedmann (D-Bar Harbor) on his legislation (LD 1477) to provide an exemption from pilotage requirements for passenger ferry services between Bar Harbor, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire spends more per public school student than all but five other states, according to a new report. At $22,252 spent per pupil on average in the 2023-2024 school year, it was surpassed by only New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Connecticut. 
It’s a statistic that has been true for years, and one that Gov. Kelly Ayotte has frequently touted. 
“If you put together the total education funding from state and local and other sources, we’re in the top 10 in the nation in terms of funding public education,” she said during a Jan. 15 press conference, responding to a pair of lawsuits alleging the state does not spend enough. 
“… That’s the reality. Shouldn’t we look at the reality of the situation versus an artificial discussion on one piece of the funding?”
But the way New Hampshire raises that money sets it apart. Despite its high overall spending, the Granite State contributed the smallest proportion of state dollars and the largest proportion of local dollars per student of all 50 states in the same school year, the report, released by the National Education Association Tuesday, states. 
New Hampshire spent proportionally less state money per student than Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, Louisiana New York, Florida, Connecticut, Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, the next nine lowest-ranked states. 
The report confirms what residents of all political stripes have long known to be true: New Hampshire’s schools are driven by local property tax collections, not state spending. And it comes against the backdrop of an ongoing fight in the state budget process over how much public school students should receive each year for education — and who should pay for it. 
Democrats and progressives cite the low level of state support as evidence that the state is abandoning its financial responsibilities and downshifting costs to local taxpayers, and say the state should spend more. School districts and taxpayers have filed two separate lawsuits seeking to force the state to do so. 
But conservatives point to the state’s aging population and steadily declining enrollment to question why the school districts should receive more funding at all. And this year, House Republicans have pushed forward proposals to reduce the amount of state tax revenue that is sent to the Education Trust Fund and impose spending caps on school districts to require supermajorities to raise local spending.
Overall, New Hampshire schools spent 6.64% more per student at the start of the 2023-2024 school year than at the start of the 2022-2023 school year, the report shows. 
Each side has drawn different conclusions from the same reality. Those conclusions have inspired competing legislation.
House Republicans have proposed a slight increase in state spending to schools in the state budget. But they have also included a measure in the budget to reduce the amount of revenue that goes to the Education Trust Fund, from the $1.3 billion a year proposed by Ayotte to $937 million per year. That account, which funds public schools and other programs such as education freedom accounts, is currently running a surplus.
House Republicans have also added legislation into the budget that would limit school district budget increases to inflation, except in the case of a certain level of enrollment growth or a supermajority vote by residents at the district’s annual meeting. 
Democrats, meanwhile, have opposed that legislation and pushed for various bills to increase the amount the state would spend per pupil overall, add targeted funding to needier school districts, and require wealthier school districts to redistribute excess statewide property tax revenue to those with lower property values. 
The NEA report shows a number of other comparison points between New Hampshire and other states. 
Across the U.S., New Hampshire saw one of the highest year-to-year drops in enrollment from the start of the 2022-2023 school year to the start of the 2023-2024 school year: a 1.47% decline. In contrast, neighboring Maine experienced a 0.9 percent enrollment decline, Vermont saw enrollment stay steady, and Massachusetts measured a 0.1 percent increase. 
But New Hampshire has the second-lowest student-to-teacher ratio in the country, after Vermont, the report states. There are on average 10.5 students per teacher in New Hampshire schools; Wyoming, in contrast, was last with 12.6 students per teacher. 
In the 2022-2023 school year, there were 10.7 students per teacher. New Hampshire’s 2.19% drop in student-to-teacher ratio is one of the largest in the country. 
Public school teacher pay in the Granite State is nearly at the national median. New Hampshire teachers made an average of $67,170 per year in 2023-2024, which ranked 24th nationally, according to the report. That amount is up by 4.7% from the year before. 
And the report indicates a wide spread of how much per year states spend on public school students. New Hampshire’s $22,252 in the 2023-2024 school year was dwarfed by New York’s $31,514, but came in well ahead of 50th-ranked Utah, which spent $11,289 per student.
Since taking office, President Donald Trump has vowed to dismantle the Department of Education and send the federal grant money back to states in the form of block grants, which has led to mixed reactions in the Granite State. But in New Hampshire, federal spending makes up just 8.4% of per pupil spending, the 45th lowest proportion in the country.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"How Trump’s coal policies will impact CT, a state with no coal power plants",Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/trump-coal-industry-policy-ct/,Many of the coal-fired power plants the Trump administration exempted from emissions reductions requirements are upwind from CT.,"There is one operating coal-fired power plant left in New England, a far cry from the widespread use of coal that began nearly a century-and-a-half ago. That plant — the Merrimack Power Station in Bow, N.H., just south of Concord — is slated to close in June 2028.
So it stands to reason that President Donald J. Trump’s recent series of executive orders, designed to make greater use of coal for electricity and fire up a rapidly dying industry in the U.S., would elicit a collective shrug from the region.
Not from Connecticut.
Connecticut, more than any state east of the Mississippi, has faced persistent poor air quality. It is caused in large part by emissions from power plants in the central part of the country — especially the more than 200 that are coal-fired, the most polluting form of energy generation.
Paul Farrell, director of planning and standards in the Air Division of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, DEEP, is certainly not shrugging.
Modeling from the Environmental Protection Agency, he said, has shown that on days Connecticut has its worst ozone pollution — the notorious smog and dirty air that occurs in the heat of summer — 90% to 95% of the air that flows into the state is already above the federal standard for pollution levels when it gets here.
“We get that long range transport from the Midwest and Western states and even Texas,” he said. “Then that combines with vehicular pollution coming up the I-95 corridor, and it all comes to a head right over New York City, that adds that pollution load into it. And then it just wafts into our state.”
Indeed, the just-released 2025 State of the Air report by the American Lung Association, ranks Southwestern Connecticut as having the 16th worst ozone pollution in the country. Four of Connecticut’s eight counties receive F grades for ozone, three receive D grades and one manages a C.
The state had 23 days last year with ozone levels above allowable federal standards. That’s the highest number recorded in recent years. Only the northern and eastern parts of the state meets 2008 ozone standards. No part of the state meets the tighter 2015 standards.

The Trump administration has given exemptions to about 70 coal plants to continue operating under the current emissions standards for at least another couple of years beyond 2027, when tighter emissions regulations put in place by the Biden administration are slated to take effect.  Among the plants that are exempt are many of the midwestern and mid-Atlantic plants directly upwind from Connecticut, as well as several plants that are the most polluting plants in the country. 
New Hampshire’s Merrimack is also on the list — a head-scratcher even to its owner, Granite Shore Power; they never requested an exemption because they already have one. With closure slated for 2028, the government didn’t require expensive pollution upgrades for that short time period.
“Without this [earlier] exemption, Merrimack Station would have been forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for monitoring equipment for a plant that will be closing months later,” a spokesman for Granite Shore said in an email statement. 
The spokesman said there is no plan to delay Merrimack’s closing, which the Trump actions would also allow. Plans to transition the plant to a solar and storage operation remain on schedule, and the coal operation will continue to comply with emissions requirements.
In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin issued a series of 31 environmental regulations the administration wanted to revisit and/or rollback. Included among them was one that set stricter limits on mercury and air toxics standards, or MATS, for coal- and oil-fired power plants. The standards he targeted were finalized a year ago by the Biden administration and would have cut emissions of mercury, which is known to cause several human health problems, carbon dioxide — a key climate change contributor — nitrogen oxide, fine particulate matter and a number of metals.
“What I foresee is that this two-year extension is but a first step of a two-step process that Lee Zeldin is orchestrating with the result being that these plants don’t have to make a single more ton or pound of pollution reductions,” said Joseph Goffman, assistant administrator of the EPA Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration. He said Zeldin’s plan to “reconsider” the MATS rule “was his way of telegraphing very, very, very unsubtly that his intention was to have the reconsideration process result in the rules being repealed altogether.”
The extension of lifelines to coal is just one of the rule rollbacks and reconsiderations proposed by the Trump EPA that could have an impact on air quality in Connecticut.
Among the most concerning is reconsideration of the Good Neighbor Plan, which would have forced 23 states upwind from Connecticut to reduce interstate transport of air pollution from power plants and other polluting industries. It is currently under a stay the Supreme Court issued last June when the justices sent it back down to lower courts. The federal Clean Air Act itself, now more than 55 years old, contains a good neighbor provision to limit interstate transport of air pollutants.
Another would reconsider the standards for motor vehicle tailpipe emissions the Biden administration tightened for cars, light and heavy-duty trucks. That has DEEP’s Farrell even more concerned than the specter of prolonged coal plant emissions.
“Without a doubt, the biggest public health/air quality impact would come from EPA significantly rolling back the mobile source standards on cars and trucks,” he said. The transportation sector accounts for the bulk of Connecticut’s pollution and ozone problems — about 67%. That’s partly because the region has eliminated coal.
“To address transport, we need a serious federal partner,” Farrell said. “Without the federal government controlling federal sources that are beyond any state’s jurisdiction, we don’t have a hope for meeting our air quality standards for ozone.”
The Trump executive action also opens the door to new coal plants. But the notion that the region would use coal again — even as a backup or in one of the existing power plants that can use more than one fuel — isn’t getting much traction here.
“Absolutely not,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association. “No. And I can underline that and an exclamation point. No. The dual fuel facilities that do exist are now gas and oil.”
The only exception in the region is the Merrimack Plant and its sister plant – the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, N.H., which no longer operates and will be redeveloped as a battery energy storage system.
“I see no future for coal in New England once those facilities permanently retire in the next few years,” Dolan said.
New England began its large-scale pullback from coal in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The last of the plants save Merrimack — the Bridgeport Harbor Station along with Salem, Brayton Point and Mt. Tom stations in Massachusetts — closed more recently.
Coal broadly is on the decline. Its use in the U.S. for power generation has fallen by about 67% since 2007, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. Its use fell below gas 10 years ago and is now only about one-third of gas.
In the last couple of years coal usage has also fallen below nuclear power, with wind closing in and hydro and solar not far behind. Wind and solar combined overtook coal usage last year for the first time, according to the energy think tank, Ember.

The biggest reason for coal’s decline in the U.S. is widely ascribed to one factor — it’s been priced out by cheap natural gas brought on by the fracking revolution which started around 2005.
“This was not the U.S. government saying ‘shut down these coal plants,’” said Michael Oristaglio, an energy expert at Yale University who founded the Energy Studies Multidisciplinary program and more recently is with the Carbon Containment Lab at Yale. “This was utility, power company owners basically looking at it and saying, ‘does it make sense to build coal or even to use coal anymore? You can convert a coal plant to natural gas.’”
Multiple analyses show coal plants to be among the more expensive forms of power. They are also slower to start up than gas, making them less suitable than gas for emergency — so-called peaker — power. 
“I can see the ones that own these old plants … saying, ‘all right, we have a little more leeway to run them.’ But I don’t see anyone building new coal,” Oristaglio said.
The U.S. does have the largest coal reserves, but China continues to use and build the most coal power, some of it in other nations. Oristaglio also said China recently has been adding carbon capture and other filter equipment to its newer plants, something that may be less worthwhile on the much older plants in the U.S. Ironically, China also has more utility-scale solar than any other country.

But with the economic and environmental focus, the issue that often gets overlooked is the outsized health impacts of pollution from coal plants. Research presented in the publication Science determined the number of U.S. deaths from 1999 to 2020 attributable to particulate matter from coal represented a more-than two times greater mortality risk than exposure to the same fine particulates from all sources.
But there are many more pollutants in coal and the effect is cumulative, said Goffman, the former EPA official.
“What’s at stake for public health is the fact that cumulatively, and so simultaneously, people are exposed to multiple pollutants, whether they’re part of fine particles or mercury or other air toxics or ozone,” he said.
“What we’re driving towards is improved public health outcomes. So I think that often gets lost. I think in the air quality story — it’s really about public health,” said Emma Cimino, DEEP’s deputy commissioner of environmental quality.
While DEEP points out that air pollution in Connecticut is vastly diminished from what it was decades ago, with so many rule rollbacks under consideration, the concern is that the strains on health might become more noticeable.
“As you start to see those tools disappear or be pulled back or even threatened, I think it’s possible that the progress slows,” Cimino said. “Hopefully it doesn’t reverse, but certainly it puts the region on a much slower track to meeting our air quality standards.”
Farrell at DEEP agreed. “At the end of the day, really we want to just remind people that this is about public health,” he said. “It’s really an all-the-above sort of solution. We can’t pick just power plants. We can’t pick just cars. You can’t just pick industrials. Everyone needs to contribute to the solution.
“I think people may have taken the environment and public health a little bit for granted, and we really shouldn’t be in a position where we need to wait for rivers to catch on fire again before we wake up and say, ‘wait a minute – this has to stop.’”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP676787172687-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 05:01:17.847767

North Carolinians are generally of two very different minds on the gun violence that plagues our society. While polls consistently show that most favor stronger laws to regulate firearms, a loud and determined minority opposes virtually any regulation.
Here, however, is at least one simple prevention step that all sides should be able to endorse: installing inside locks on the doors to college classrooms.
As NC State professor Walter Robinson explained in a recent NC Newsline op-ed, he and his faculty colleagues have repeatedly asked school leaders to install locks in all classrooms and lecture halls so that instructors and students can shelter in place in the event of a campus shooting.
Unfortunately, and amazingly, however, the requests have been rejected. The reason: cost.
And it’s hard to overstate just how absurd this is.
The bottom line: In a multi-billion dollar system, it’s ridiculous that university leaders didn’t long ago invest in such a simple and basic safety precaution. Further delay is inexcusable.

A new GOP proposal lays the groundwork for digital tokens to become more mainstream.
With the stock market’s volatility, investment experts suggest diversifying your portfolio. Ohio politicians are trying to give more incentives for that, too.
“We are authorizing the use of cryptocurrency as just another way to keep up with the current practices that are generally accepted by the American public and by the people of the state of Ohio,” State Treasurer Robert Sprague said.
Sprague and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose are trying to show the state is “an innovative leader,” eventually allowing Ohioans to use it to pay for state fees and services, like taxes.
The pair is proposing that state agencies be allowed to accept crypto, but it is not mandatory.
Although it could eventually get to taxes, it would start slower with just the secretary’s office, meaning business filings.
“My office is prepared to be the first in state government to begin accepting Bitcoin and to do so immediately,” LaRose said.
So, what exactly is cryptocurrency?
Crypto is a “peer-to-peer digital currency, and it’s outside of an independent central governing authority,” Case Western Reserve University Veale Institute for Entrepreneurship’s Michael Goldberg said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe professor explained that the online “coins” are stored in a digital database known as a blockchain. Like stocks, they can be traded and sold. One Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fluctuates and was worth more than $94,000 as of 6 p.m. on Friday.
“Oftentimes with Bitcoin, there are less fees associated with it,” he said.
Two other crypto proposals are being heard in the Ohio House, with one trying to make sure that fees stay low. Both sponsored by state Rep, Steve Demetriou, R-Bainbridge Twp., one bill would “protect” cryptocurrency from putting certain taxes on it. The other would allow the treasurer to invest in “high value digital assets” in the general or reserve fund.
But because crypto spikes and falls rapidly, Goldberg warned that payments could be hard to calculate.


Government accountability advocate Catherine Turcer, with Common Cause Ohio, said this isn’t safe for the state’s finances.
“It is electronic money, anything could happen to it,” Turcer said. “Whether it’s hacking, deflation — when you pay on April 15 your taxes, and it nosedives on the 16th — it’s just too volatile.”
The treasurer explained that their system would immediately change the currency format once submitted.
“Our mission here is to have a thoughtful, safe and secure process for accepting this cryptocurrency and converting it immediately into United States dollars for the state treasury to hold,” Sprague said.
In 2024, the FBI reported $9.3 billion in losses due to cryptocurrency cybercrime.
There will always be financial fraud, Goldberg said, but when it’s online, it’s much more difficult to get back.
“Crypto is still a bit of the wild, wild west; it’s basically completely deregulated,” he said. “If somebody gets defrauded, it may be a bit more challenging for them to recoup their assets.”
It’s too risky, Turcer continued.
“Money is worth the money we say it’s worth,” she said.
Bitcoin is based on the dollar’s price, Goldberg said.
Asked whether the putting Bitcoin forward would undermine the U.S. dollar, Sprague paused, then said no.
“Having a digital asset like Bitcoin really doesn’t have anything to do with necessarily the value of the dollar,” he answered. “The number of dollars is fixed. Just because you’re allowing a transaction to occur in Bitcoin and then converting it to dollars will do nothing in terms of the strength or the weakness of the United States dollar.”
Flashbacks
This isn’t the first time the treasurer’s office tried to make crypto work.
Back in 2018, then-Treasurer Josh Mandel decided that Ohioans could pay their taxes in crypto. Within a year, the program was suspended because Attorney General Dave Yost issued an opinion that Mandel didn’t follow correct protocol in setting up the system.
“We’ll have a real process to this,” Sprague said in the recent press conference. “We’ll have a transparent process.”
Turcer is also getting reminded of the early 2000s, she said.
“We had alternative investments,” she said, referencing Coingate. “We were investing in rare coins — and you know what? The state of Ohio got ripped off.”
Coingate was a scam in which the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation invested hundreds of millions in “rare coins.” The investments were run by people aligned with the Ohio GOP. This eventually led to millions of dollars being lost and Gov. Bob Taft being the first Ohio governor charged with a crime while in office.
Crypto isn’t random, Goldberg said, and it’s been around — and profitable — for years. According to Forbes, the global cryptocurrency market cap is more than $3 trillion.
“When Bitcoin came out, I think there were a lot of questions,” Goldberg said. “And it’s held up.”
Why now?
Both Sprague and LaRose were asked if they or members of their staff own assets in cryptocurrency or if they invest in cryptocurrency-related companies.
“I wish,” Sprague laughed, and denied owning or investing in crypto.
“I do,” LaRose said. “I’m somebody that has been curious about this technology and this form of currency for a long time.”
He referenced financial disclosure documents, which are filed in May, that he said would show his financial involvement in crypto.
“I think at this point I own like $10,000 worth of Bitcoin that I’ve been able to amass by putting a little bit of my paycheck aside each month,” he said.
OCJ/WEWS requested his previous disclosures. None showed any crypto investments explicitly. He had only started investing in 2024, his team said on Friday.
LaRose isn’t the only politician who owns crypto and promotes it. President Donald Trump released his own coin, which just got a boost in the market since he offered a private dinner with him to the coin’s largest investors.
“It is interesting that (LaRose is) proposing this — it both curries favor with the president and could actually make him richer,” Turcer said. “The more people participate in the Bitcoin system, the more the value raises.”
The secretary argued that this is just to move the state forward.
“Ohioans have accepted this as a real form of currency, a form of exchange that they want to use,” he said.
Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is also a big fan of the currency. Both LaRose and Sprague have been on the campaign trail with him.
The two were asked how the measure fits in with any interests they have in becoming Ramaswamy’s pick for lieutenant governor. Sprague said he hadn’t talked to Ramaswamy about it.
“This is something that we’re working on, together, through our respective offices, to modernize our offices and make it easier for the people of the state of Ohio… So this is something we’re doing internally,” Sprague said. “We’re not doing this on the campaign trail.”
LaRose was less enthused with the question.

“I’m not gonna dignify any speculation about who Mr. Ramaswamy may or may not pick as his running mate,” he said, also saying he hadn’t spoken to the candidate about his proposal. “The reason I’m supporting him is because I appreciate his intellect and his policy stances and if this is something that he’s a fan of as well, that doesn’t surprise me.”
The Board of Deposit, which includes Sprague, Yost and Auditor Keith Faber, will meet in the coming weeks to review the proposal.

(File photo by Amanda Gokee/New Hampshire Bulletin)When we read or hear a claim repeated over and over again, we are more likely to think it is true even when it is not true. It’s called the illusory truth effect, and it’s why repetition is a fundamental tool used, yes, in politics, but especially in consumer product advertising. And more and more it’s being used by corporations to highlight their sunny side whenever the corporation’s reputation as a good corporate citizen comes into question.
A case in point is Casella’s recent campaign to convince New Hampshire that when it comes to the environment, Casella is one of the “good guys.” The company has unleashed what amounts to a public relations blitz, emphasizing its commitment to environmental sustainability.
Just in the last week Casella offered up a “Special Advertising Section” in New Hampshire Magazine titled “Casella Comes Full Circle for its Anniversary,” suggesting that though it started in the trash business it is now in the sustainability business. That comes on top of a number of other recent actions by the company, including a national press release announcing its “2024 Sustainability Report”; a mailer to residents of New Hampshire’s North Country titled “Driving Sustainability in NH”; and a $1.5 million donation to the University of Vermont for which the University gave it naming rights to establish the “Casella Center for Circular Economy and Sustainability at UVM.”
All this smacks of “greenwashing,” a practice roughly defined as a company using corporate money and its public relations apparatus to mislead people into believing that it is more environmentally friendly than it actually is.
Casella’s management and its directors may very well be committed to sustainability as a concept, but it is a huge stretch for the company to promote itself as being in the sustainability business. Casella’s core business is trash collection and landfilling, essentially the antithesis of sustainability. According to Casella’s most recent filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, only 20% of its revenues come from business activities (such as recycling) that are even remotely connected to sustainability.
And there is little to no indication that going forward Casella will focus on sustainability. It tells its investors that its growth will be fueled by acquisitions of trash collection service territories, necessitating the need for construction and/or expansion of new landfills across the Northeast.
Casella likes to talk about its origin story: It started in 1975 with one truck picking up trash in Rutland, Vermont. In 50 years it has grown to be a $7 billion corporation, with nearly $1.5 billion in annual revenue.
What the company does not like to talk about is all of the environmental problems it has created, and all of the enemies it has made along the way to becoming a $7 billion corporation.
Casella has trash operations all over the Northeast, but it is an especially big player in northern New England. In New Hampshire, it operates one of three major landfills — the NCES landfill in Bethlehem.
The NCES landfill has been beset by environmental problems. It was only recently discovered that holes in the landfill liner were created during the construction of the landfill some 30 years ago; the consequences for contamination of nearby water supplies and groundwater are as yet unknown. And it took Casella two full days to discover that the largest leachate spill in New England (150,000-plus gallons) occurred at NCES in 2021. Now four years later, the extent of soil and groundwater contamination from the accident is still under investigation.
These are not isolated incidents. New Hampshire’s Department of Environmental Services (DES) notified NCES that it had found hundreds of permit violations for leachate management during a recent two-year period. In contrast, DES found only a few handfuls of similar violations at other New Hampshire landfills, including Mount Carberry and Turnkey, which other than management competence are similar to NCES.
With that kind of record, it’s little wonder that Casella would want to use its public relations apparatus to bill itself as in the sustainability business. This is especially true given the fact that it has been trying for six years to bully our state to approve permits for it to build a new mega-landfill (the GSL project) in Dalton. It has even suggested that it would not invest in a newly planned recycling center in downstate New Hampshire unless it gets permits to build GSL.
It’s to our great good luck that we now have a governor who is standing up to that bullying, a redirected DES that is more focused on environmental protection, and an educated populace that is able to recognize greenwashing for what it is.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7508-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 05:01:17.847767

One of the largest utility scandals in U.S. history has remained largely unknown outside Ohio — until now.







Last week, HBO released a documentary that covers the long, sordid saga, which led to the federal criminal convictions of a former speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives and a former head of the Ohio Republican Party.


“The Dark Money Game: Ohio Confidential” follows the story of how utility companies used roughly $60 million in bribes to public officials to secure more than $1.5 billion in ratepayer subsidies for aging, uneconomical coal and nuclear plants.


Canary Media contributing reporter Kathiann Kowalski has spent more than a decade covering the House Bill 6 saga and Ohio utilities’ other efforts to get ratepayer-funded bailouts. Dan Haugen, a senior editor at Canary Media, recently spoke with Kowalski about her reactions to the new film.


The following transcript has been edited slightly for length and clarity.
Haugen: So, you watched this new HBO documentary ​“Ohio Confidential” the other day. What about it is still on your mind today? 


Kowalski: I was struck by the focus they used of how dark money and gerrymandering undermined voters’ will in the wake of a 2010 Supreme Court case that opened the door for unlimited corporate spending on political campaigns, subject to few conditions.


Haugen: Was there any factual information that wasn’t previously reported by you or others?


Kowalski: A lot of it was very familiar, given the fact that I had read through most of the exhibits, read Neil Clark’s book, gone to part of the trial, and been following this for years. There was an interesting scene where they were able to get footage of the FBI observing a private detective that former Ohio GOP Chair Matt Borges and company had apparently retained to follow Tyler Fehrman, who was a witness in the federal criminal case.


Haugen: Did the film change your understanding of the HB 6 story in any way? 













Kowalski: They did a decent job connecting some dots. I had not thought through how former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder’s actions also enabled a far-right coalition in the Legislature to push through an anti-abortion law in 2019. It gave me a broader perspective on the anti-democracy angle of the public corruption, but my understanding of the basic story did not change.


Haugen: Where did the abortion legislation appear on the timeline?


Kowalski: The way that the filmmaker presents it is that once Householder helped these people get the anti-abortion legislation passed, he then had people who felt they owed him something. I looked at the timing, and Gov. Mike DeWine signed the anti-abortion legislation the day before House Bill 6 was introduced.


Haugen: One of the biggest unknowns still today is what, if any, role the governor’s office had in all this. You and others have reported on a December 2018 dinner with FirstEnergy executives, DeWine, and Jon Husted, just weeks before the latter two took office as governor and lieutenant governor. Neither has been charged nor accused of any wrongdoing. Does the film shed any new light on their connections?


Kowalski: The filmmakers include an allegation of $5 million going from FirstEnergy to help elect DeWine. And they note a disclaimer from DeWine’s office that it was all within the confines of what was allowed under the law. That’s basically about all they did. It was not a deep dive into the governor’s actions or Husted, who was recently appointed to fill Vice President JD Vance’s U.S. Senate seat. I think maybe they wanted to keep their story tightly focused on the legislature and what has been proven in the first federal criminal case. That also avoids having to include more disclaimers about how nothing’s been proven against others, everybody denies wrongdoing, etc., etc.



Haugen: So is this something you would recommend that your readers watch? 


Kowalski: Yes. It’s compelling storytelling. It does a good job of explaining things in plain terms. There’s a limited cast of characters, and you can follow the story. If House Bill 6 is new to you, it’s definitely worth watching. And it’s certainly important now as we’re looking at not only the continued use of dark money in politics through either nonprofits or limited liability corporations, but also, with technology, likely more ways to cover up potential bribes. So, yes, people should be aware of this.

(Getty Images)When residents of Wichita’s 29th and Grove neighborhood were told their groundwater was contaminated by carcinogens, it wasn’t just an environmental disaster — it was a breach of trust. It shook the foundation that communities are built on: the right to live safely, the right to breathe freely, the right to know the truth.
After tireless advocacy, $3.5 million has been secured to fund health screenings for those affected. It is a needed and important step. But we must be honest: Screenings alone are not justice.
If we are serious about restoring what has been broken, we have to look deeper. We have to ask hard questions:

How will these funds be distributed?
Who will be prioritized?
Will the process be transparent?
Will the people most harmed lead the solutions?

We’ve seen how mishandled recovery funds deepen harm. The national opioid settlements taught us that when money is moved without community voices, it’s often spent inefficiently, unevenly, and inequitably.
Those closest to the crisis must be closest to the power.
That’s why the response to 29th and Grove must be guided by clear, community-centered best practices:

Center the people most harmed. Focus all abatement efforts around their needs, leadership, and healing.
Prioritize free culturally responsive, and evidence-informed care rooted in best practices.
Establish an independent advisory board made up of affected residents.
Require public reporting of all grant distributions and health outcomes.
Invest in long-term monitoring, not one-time fixes.
Minimize administrative waste so that the majority of dollars reach people directly.

The urgency we face right now cannot be overstated. Every day that passes without real action is another day families in our community live with fear, uncertainty, and preventable harm.
That’s why we didn’t wait. Members of the Safe Streets Wichita Coalition, mutual aid groups, and other local community-based groups came together and moved. While officials debated and delayed, we organized free air purifier workshops — providing real tools to our elders, children, teachers, and neighbors in northeast Wichita to help reduce exposure and create healthier indoor spaces.
It wasn’t a perfect solution — but it was something people could use immediately. It was action rooted in evidence, in harm reduction, and in community care. It was the difference between waiting for permission and answering the call ourselves.
Just like during the overdose crisis and early days of the epidemic, our coalition didn’t stand by.
We organized.
We responded.
We showed up.
Because when lives are at risk, community care cannot wait — and neither will we.
This spirit — the willingness to step up when institutions fall short — has to shape the road ahead. Right now, we have a rare chance to show what real community repair looks like: honest, responsive, and deeply rooted in justice.
If we truly believe that health is a human right, then these dollars cannot be treated like charity. They are just a small down payment on a much larger moral debt — a debt that’s long overdue. The residents of 29th and Grove deserve nothing less.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Just as Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was never really about improving government efficiency – quite the opposite, in fact – the 5,000-plus page biennial budget rewrite the Ohio House slapped together and sent to the Ohio Senate was never really about improving the common good of everyday Ohioans.
It was about advancing the hard-right priorities of powerful politicians who answer to big money – not constituents in gerrymandered voting districts.   
Yet even for the supremely arrogant kingpin of state government, Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, the budget bill passed out of the General Assembly’s lower chamber on April 9 was beyond the pale in cruelty and cunning.
It is the Ohio version of Project 2025 with all the unsparing, exacting hallmarks of the Trumpian blueprint, recklessly destroying federal institutions and agencies that, however imperfectly, protect, serve and promote the welfare of we, the people.
But that’s the MAGA nihilistic way and Ohio Republicans are doing their part in tearing down what made Ohio great. Huffman, the Lima Republican who runs the state under the one party rule he rigged with unconstitutional redistricting, is in the catbird seat calling the shots. The speaker (and former Ohio Senate president) lords over the GOP supermajority in the Ohio House while his political protégé, Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, accommodates the boss.
Huffman, who once said the quiet part out loud about GOP gerrymandering (“We can kind of do what we want”), now has a straight runway to enact his blueprint on Ohioans whether they like it or not. I suspect his budget proposal will survive, largely intact, with the House caucus he controls and the one he led with an iron fist for four years in the Senate.
Local public schools, public libraries, clean drinking initiatives, lead poisoning prevention, pediatric cancer funding, home visits for new mothers, food assistance programs and health care coverage for the poor are all on the chopping block in Huffman’s House Bill 96.
What wasn’t on his slash-and-burn budget list were government handouts (taxpayer-funded vouchers) to upper-income private school families. But doling out unlimited government subsidies to the affluent, whose darlings are already attending and affording elite high schools and religious institutions, is Huffman’s thing.
He is on a crusade to shower hundreds of millions of public education dollars on unaccountable private and predominantly religious schools – despite clear prohibitions against such a diversion of public money in the Ohio Constitution.
“No religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any part of the school funds of this state,” the state constitution reads.
But Huffman has defied the state constitution before with impunity (on gerrymandering) and did so again by ramrodding his universal voucher bonanza through the legislature for everyone, regardless of income. Never mind that the giant state giveaway – to offset private school costs for the well-off – blew a $1 billion dollar hole in the general revenue budget its first year.
Never mind that public schools in the state, forever cash-strapped and dependent on tapped out property owners, labored under an unequal, inadequate school funding formula (ruled unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court) for 26 years before a bipartisan coalition agreed to a phased-in funding solution over six years. The final two-year phase was expected to be fully funded in the current biennial budget negotiations.
Not under Huffman. Not in a state where the Republican lock on power is absolute and the Statehouse heavyweight has free, unchecked rein to flout the law and grossly defund the public schools that educate the vast majority of Ohio students (approximately 1.6 million) while greatly expanding appropriations for private school tuitions, homeschooling expenses and even unchartered, nonpublic schools with deeply held religious beliefs that are virtually unregulated by the state!
Funding for the “thorough and efficient system of common schools” state government is constitutionally obligated to secure – and that would have been secured under the Fair School Funding Plan from 2021 – shrank by over $400 million. House Republicans added insult to injury by robbing fiscally prudent school districts of surplus revenue for future planning to give uneven, one-time property tax relief in some districts and not others. They also ensured that property tax owners will face more school levies from local districts forced to deplete that surplus operating revenue. Sound policymaking (or genuine property tax relief) this is not.
But it is a gut punch to public schools, just as a $100 million reduction in funding to Ohio’s public libraries is, or cutting over $22 million from the Help Me Grow program is for in-home visits to newborn babies to mitigate the state’s infant mortality problem. But Matt Huffman’s Ohio-centric Project 2025 is also a kick in the teeth to democratic self-governance.
Last budget go-around Republican lawmakers stripped the Ohio Board of Education of most of its power and gave it to the governor. This two-year budget proposes cutting all 11 elected members of the board and shrinking the gubernatorial appointments from nine to five. This is Matt Huffman removing voters entirely from state education policy as he engineers total opaque privatization of Ohio schools.
How is silencing the electorate improving the common good?

(Getty Images)Nebraska stands at a critical juncture, with our economic future increasingly at stake. Recent criticism by State Auditor Mike Foley regarding the fiscal impact of business tax incentives is another troubling example in an alarming trend of attacks undermining economic development.
The Greater Omaha Chamber believes strongly that strategic economic development programs, including robust business tax incentives, are not merely beneficial. They are essential.
Foley’s report casts doubt on the value of these incentives. It overlooked the careful and transparent consideration these programs have received.
Nebraska’s Legislature and the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board consistently factor these incentives into revenue projections, thoroughly assessing both costs and returns.
Paying for performance
These are well-established “pay-for-performance” incentives. Nebraska taxpayers incur no cost unless recipient businesses fulfill predetermined benchmarks including job creation and major capital investment.
We currently over-perform in economic development wins with a very limited number of tools for this purpose. Thus, far from being fiscal liabilities, incentives tie to proven economic outcomes and benefits for our state.
Unfortunately, the auditor’s critique fuels a narrative that disregards the competitive nature of today’s economic landscape. Nebraska now ranks 40th nationally in incentives awarded, according to Site Selection Group. This position places us well behind more aggressive neighboring states with targeted incentive programs. If we continue down this path, we risk falling further behind, jeopardizing not only potential economic opportunities but also the stability of existing businesses that drive our state’s economy.
Economic development matters
Economic development is not an abstract luxury. It is the engine that powers every aspect of our quality of life in Nebraska, from job creation and infrastructure to education and property tax relief.
Yet a disturbing climate at the State Capitol increasingly dismisses the importance of these development tools, labeling them as optional or expendable. This short-sighted view poses threats as companies weighing Nebraska for investment and expansion consider how supportive and stable the business environment is.
Every day, the Greater Omaha Chamber and economic development organizations across Nebraska witness firsthand how economic incentives attract new businesses, encourage local expansions and create thousands of jobs for Nebraskans.
These jobs provide economic security and stability for families, generate substantial new tax revenues and create vibrant communities capable of supporting quality public services and education.
Fighting brain drain
It is these opportunities that serve as plug in our brain drain challenge.
Let us be clear: Transparent oversight and accountability for public funds are indispensable. No one disputes the importance of regularly assessing the effectiveness of economic programs.
However, we strongly oppose political attacks that distort the record and ignore the essential role these incentives have played in Nebraska’s growth.
Nebraska’s elected officials, business leaders and communities must rally around our proven economic development programs. We must recommit to a vision of strategic, forward-looking growth, ensuring Nebraska can effectively compete and thrive.
Now is the time to bolster — not undermine — our state’s competitiveness through strategic incentives that foster sustained economic growth. Our businesses and all Nebraskans deserve nothing less.

More than 3 million people with Medicare could be eligible for the difficult-to-find and expensive weight-loss drug under new guidance which can cover the medication for patients who are obese or those who have a history of heart disease and are at risk of a heart attack or stroke.  (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.














I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University







GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Anthony Brown (D), left, with then-Attorney General Brian Frosh (D) at a 2018 event in Annapolis, after Brown was elected to succeed Frosh, who stepped down. (File photo by Bruce DePuyt/Maryland Matters)Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) didn’t wait until President Donald Trump (R) was inaugurated on Jan. 20 to start preparing a defense against likely actions by the incoming administration.
When it became clear last year that Trump would secure a second term, Brown said he and his team immediately began researching executive orders and policies the administration pushed in his first term, from 2017 to 2021.
Now, as Trump approaches 100 days in office, Brown has led or joined more than two dozen lawsuits filed by Democratic attorneys general across the country challenging the rapid-fire policy pronouncements of the new administration.
Brown’s office created a tab on its website called “Federal Actions Response,” which provides Marylanders resources and other information on immigration, human rights, LGBTQ and federal employment for those impacted by Trump administration actions.
“I made a commitment that I would bring or join only those actions where I believe Marylanders are harmed or impacted in a way that’s important and meaningful to them,” Brown said in an interview Friday. “So, we’re going to protect the interest the Marylanders talk about every day around their kitchen table.”
Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore County) said Friday he had not reviewed any of the current suits against the administration, but he’s certain of one thing.
“There’s no question that this attorney general and the prior attorney general are politically in tune with the mission of the national Democratic Party,” West said. “They’re going to file lawsuits against Republican presidents and not … against Democratic presidents, unless absolutely forced to. Ultimately, the taxpayers are paying for all these lawsuits, for the legal resources needed to bring these lawsuits.”
HHS workers show up at Maryland offices Tuesday to find they were fired overnight

Brown said the complaints filed have nothing to do with politics.
“I would challenge anyone to point to an action that I have either joined or brought where I cannot connect that action to what it means for Marylanders in their day-to-day lives,” he said.
“These are not political statements,” Brown said. “These are challenges to practical issues and problems that are being created by the Trump administration.”
Lawsuits include one filed Friday, with 18 other states in a federal court in Massachusetts, challenging the administration’s threat to withhold funding from school systems that do not comply with its ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. The suit said that action would “unlawfully imperil more than $13.8 billion that are spent to educate our youth” that includes children in high-poverty communities and those with special needs.
Brown was the lead attorney on a suit that challenged the firing of thousands of probationary federal workers. A U.S. District judge in Greenbelt on April 1 issued a preliminary injunction in the case, ordering 20 agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, Labor, and Transportation, to give workers their jobs back while the case was tried.
He was also co-lead on a brief supporting a challenge to Trump’s executive orders on transgender rights. One declared that the federal government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, and another ordered institutions that receive federal funding to stop gender-affirming care for transgender people.
But Brown doesn’t take all the credit for setting a roadmap to challenge the Trump administration. He gives some credit to his predecessor, Brian Frosh (D), who served as att0rney general in Trump’s last term.
In 2017, the General Assembly passed a resolution authorizing the attorney general to “take specified actions regarding civil and criminal suits” against federal actions that negatively affect Marylanders. That effort was hampered by the fact that any legal action would have to be reviewed by Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who did not allocate the $1 million for legal work the resolution called for, Frosh said.
“I’m envious of Attorney General Brown who gets resources and support from Gov. [Wes] Moore,” Frosh said in an interview Friday.
“I had to cobble together resources to play each case, and we got pro bono assistance from law firms. We had people in the office working overtime, volunteering to work on cases that weren’t in their normal portfolio,” he said. “We worked hard.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Still, Frosh said his office either led or joined in about 95 suits against the administration during Trump’s first four years in office, well below the blistering pace set by Brown and the other attorneys general in the first few months of Trump’s second term.
Frosh defends the lawsuits, saying the attorney general “goes after bad actors every day of the week. This was just a bad actor [Trump] at the very highest level of government, no different from somebody who’s cheating, stealing or abusing people in Maryland. It’s just from a much higher perch.”
‘Challenging environment’
Frosh said he and other attorneys general notched some important wins against the Trump administration, defending the Affordable Care Act, challenging the delay to an Obama-era rule that let student borrowers get loan forgiveness if a predatory school engaged in deceptive conduct, and blocking the separation of immigrant families at the southern border.
But Frosh said he’s most proud of the emoluments lawsuit filed in 2017 by him and former D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine (D). The suit said Trump illegally profited off his presidency by accepting payments from foreign and domestic officials who stayed at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., and patronized other Trump family businesses.
In the face of appeals from Trump and the Justice Department, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the suit could move forward. By the time it reached the Supreme Court, it was declared moot because Trump was out of office. But Frosh notes that, “We didn’t lose that case. We won it. Then the Supreme Court said, ‘OK, well, it doesn’t matter anymore because he’s not president.’”
He remains concerned about what might happen with current Supreme Court and it 6-3 conservative majority of conservative justices. He pointed to the court’s decision last year that U.S. presidents have full criminal immunity for their official “core constitutional” acts, but not for unofficial acts.
Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative returns to reiterate its points

“If you look at the Constitution, the word immunity does not appear in Article 2, which is the article about the president,” he said. “No Supreme Court has ever suggested a president had blanket immunity for official acts. It’s Trump’s dream come true.”
But still, Frosh hopes the Supreme Court will assess the rule of law when it comes to Trump.
“I’m hoping that even this Supreme Court will have the guts to stand up. It’s a much more challenging environment than it was eight years ago,” said Frosh, who now consults with Bloomberg Philanthropies on climate issues and the Maryland Bar Association on criminal justice issues.
‘Our day job’
Both Brown and Frosh stress that, despite the attention they garner, the suits against the Trump administration are not the main focus of the office. The attorney general is the state’s top prosecutor, but he also helps direct and act as a legal adviser for various state agencies, boards and offices.
Under Brown’s leadership since January 2023, and thanks to a Democratic-majority General Assembly, the office has received new responsibilities or expanded authority to include:

Statutory authority to enforce federal and state civil rights laws, but also bring class action lawsuits in working in conjunction with the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights;
Expand authority of the Independent Investigations Division to prosecute police-involved deaths and near fatal injuries;
Establishment of the “Environmental and Natural Resources Crimes Unit,” previously called Environmental Crimes Unit, which can now investigate and prosecute those who break state criminal environmental and natural resources laws; and
Creation of nohomeforhate,md.gov, the Civil Rights Division’s portal to track hate crime and identify trends.

Besides making history as the state’s first Black attorney general, Brown partnered in October 2023 with Public Defender Natasha Dartigue to co-chair the Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative (MEJC). The group released a report last month with 18 recommendations to eliminate racial discrimination in the criminal justice system.
“We’ve got a new president and a new administration in Washington which challenged us. We’ve got to step up our game, but we still have our day job,” Brown said.
“I tell my team, ‘You’ve got to maintain your work life balance. You’ve got to take care of yourself, your personal well-being, your family,'” he said. “I’m proud of my team that’s getting the job done.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Anthony-Brown-Brian-Frosh-192018-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-29 03:59:39.653858

Few seemed surprised by the move, which has been discussed for several years. That discussion picked up when the team was bought two years ago by a new ownership group that said it was looking to replace the isolated and outdated Northwest Stadium.
The team talked to officials in Maryland, the District and Virginia about a move. Despite putting together what Gov. Wes Moore (D) called “a very competitive offer” to keep the team at its current site, most were like House Majority Whip Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s), a lifelong fan, who said he understands the historical connection some fans have to the team being in D.C.
“We’ve known that since the new ownership got control of the team, they were interested in exploring going back to D.C.,” said Lewis, whose district includes the stadium site. “We’ve also known that a lot of the fan base use that as their ancestral home.
“We’re going to start preparing to move forward,” he said.
The team played in Washington from 1937 to 1996, with last 35 years at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium. It has a lease at Northwest Stadium through 2027, but is not expected leave until 2030, when a new D.C. stadium is ready.
Even as the state worked to keep the team in Landover, it has been “responsibly preparing for the possibility of the Washington Commanders choosing to return to Washington,” Moore said in a statement released by his office Monday.
Nearly $4 billion deal reached to bring Washington Commanders back to D.C.

In December, team owner Josh Harris signed a memorandum of understanding with Moore and Prince George’s Acting County Executive Tara H. Jackson that said team would begin demolition of the Landover stadium within 90 days of playing its first game at a new stadium. After demolition, the agreement calls on the team to work with state and county agencies to transform the site into “a vibrant mixed-use development,” to include residential, retail “and other allowable uses.”
Moore said the goal is to ensure the area “will not create blight in the community” and not be “another RFK Stadium,” which has sunk into disrepair and become a blight on the neighborhood since hosting its last event in 2017.
“What’s important going forward is that the Landover community receives the investment that it deserves,” he said. “Currently we have a nearly 200-acre property that gets used eight times a year for a few hours, and I have said from my earliest days as governor that the people of the area deserve better.”
The state has already work to improve the area, approving a $400 million investment in 2022 for redevelopment of areas around the county’s four Metrorail Blue Line stations, which include the Morgan Boulevard Station, walking distance from the stadium.
Federal, state and county officials held a groundbreaking ceremony April 9 for a new Civic Plaza near the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building, down the street from Largo Town Center Metrorail station. That project, scheduled for completion in December, calls for an enclosed dog park, a playground and an area for community events.
It represents one of five planned and the first ever with investment from the Maryland Stadium Authority.
The money, approved in 2022 by the General Assembly, did not require any of the funds to be used for a new stadium, but as a boost to revitalize those communities inside the Beltway instead.
Longtime fans such as Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) were around when the team moved from RFK Stadium to Prince George’s in 1997, when the stadium was named for then-team owner Jack Kent Cooke — who also labeled the area “Raljon” for his sons, Ralph and John.

It became FedEx Field when Daniel Snyder bought the team in 1999 and kept that name until Harris and his partners two years ago for about $6 billion. The stadium was called Commanders Field for a few months in 2024, before the team secured a deal to call the site Northwest Stadium named after Northwest Federal Credit Union.
In addition to Commanders games, the stadium has hosted international soccer matches, concerts for performers including U2, Taylor Swift and the Beyoncé Renaissance World Tour, and last year’s 125th Army-Navy college football game.
Alsobrooks, who helped secure state funding and private investment toward the Blue Line corridor as county executive in 2022, pushed to improve the Landover community whether or not the team remained in Maryland.
“I know this area will continue to transform before our eyes with housing, retail and so much more,” she said in a texted statement Monday. “Our continued investment will revitalize our Landover community and energize our entire state.”
Belinda Queen, president of the Coalition of Central Prince George’s County Community Organizations that includes Landover, said there’s one business residents aren’t interested in: data centers.
“Virginia has data centers. Virginia is bigger and has more land,” she said. “I get it. Data centers bring some source of income, and we do need some source of income, but they need to be in places where there’s plenty of land and not close to where people live. Put them where warehouses are.”
As for the team going back to D.C., she said, “Can’t cry over spilled milk. That whole big [stadium site] can be an indoor shopping mall, or a big place where people can live, work and play. It’s time to move the county forward.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/04/Northwest-Stadium-4-28-2025-1024x617.jpg,,,2025-04-29 03:59:39.653858
,California,2025-04-29 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,One faction scores win in Capitol’s perpetual ‘tort wars’ while another battleground looms,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/tort-wars-capitol-politics-law/,"In the latest installment of the Capitol's ""tort wars,"" a new proposal that would've enabled higher payouts for tax disputes was killed. Meanwhile, larger lawsuit payouts are affecting Los Angeles coffers, creating politically unusual positions.","One of the state Capitol’s perpetual conflicts, dubbed “tort wars,” pits personal injury attorneys and their allies, such as labor unions, against business groups and their insurers over laws governing which activities can be subjected to damage-seeking lawsuits.
Over the years, as one side seeks to expand the universe of civil wrongs (torts) that can be brought to court and the other seeks to freeze or even shrink such opportunities, titanic political clashes have erupted either in the Capitol or the ballot arena.
One highlight — or lowlight — of the never-ending duel occurred in 1987 when private negotiations over a tobacco war truce moved from the Capitol to Frank Fat’s restaurant, a Sacramento political hangout. Then-state Assembly Speaker Willie Brown hopped from table to table. The result was the infamous “napkin deal” that gave something to each faction and suspended hostilities for a few years.
Overall, tort wars have been something of a standoff as each side claimed occasional victories and suffered occasional losses. But they continue because the potential stakes are many billions of dollars. Well-heeled participants will spend millions on lobbying fees, campaign contributions to legislators and ballot measure battles to prevail.
Three years ago, the warring factions were headed for a very expensive showdown with dueling ballot measures. The pro-litigation side had qualified a measure for the 2022 ballot that would, if passed, have virtually repealed a 1975 law limiting pain and suffering damages in medical malpractice suits to $250,000.

Data & Trackers 
Special interests poured more than half a billion into California lobbying last year 

by Jeremia Kimelman 





In response, the Civil Justice Association of California, an umbrella organization of business and insurance interests, proposed a countermeasure that would have limited lawyers’ shares of personal injury damages to 20%.
The standoff resulted in a quickly enacted compromise that preserved the cap on malpractice damages but gradually raises it. The two ballot measures were shelved.
Legislative sessions usually see at least one effort by one or both of the factions to change tort law. This year’s example is Senate Bill 799, carried by Sen. Ben Allen, an El Segundo Democrat, and backed by trial lawyers, labor unions, local governments and Attorney General Rob Bonta. SB 799 would extend California’s False Claims Act to high-dollar tax disputes, thus allowing lawyers to go after taxpayers deemed to be scofflaws and collect fees if they win.
Its introduction sparked an intense effort by business and insurance groups, via the Civil Justice Association of California and the California Taxpayers Association, to strangle the measure.
The bill easily cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee but opponents prevailed in a showdown hearing in the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee last week, with just two of the committee’s five members (both Democrats) voting for it. Two other Democrats refused to vote, which had the same practical effect as voting “no.”

The civil justice and taxpayers groups hailed their win, declaring, “SB 799 would have unleashed shakedown lawsuits against business owners and outsourced the state’s responsibility for tax enforcement to the plaintiffs’ bar.”
There was an ironic coincidence on the issue. As SB 799 was being rejected, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass was visiting Sacramento to plead for state help in dealing with her city’s huge budget deficit, citing a huge increase in payouts from liability lawsuits as a major factor.
“Liability settlements have tripled from backed up lawsuits during the pandemic in uncapped damages,” Bass said.
City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto accompanied Bass to seek a limit on damages from suits against cities. “We’re trying to bring California more into the mainstream and make sure that we don’t pay taxpayer dollars out unnecessarily or in disproportionate amounts,” Feldstein Soto said.
Their position is a little odd, given that the League of California Cities had supported SB 799.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Health care is built on trust — between patients and providers, families and caregivers, communities and the systems that serve them.
Every day in Maryland, nurses, doctors and health care staff show up with skill, compassion and commitment to keep us well. But there’s a growing concern within the walls of our hospitals, clinics, emergency departments and urgent care centers, nursing homes and assisted living facilities: an increase in workplace violence directed at those providing care.
These incidents don’t define our health care system, which remains a safe and healing space for patients, but they do represent a critical challenge we must address to protect the workforce behind it.
At the Maryland Patient Safety Center, we’ve launched our “Care Flows Both Ways” campaign to show the need for more respectful interactions in health care facilities. Our organization and the health care workers we seek to assist are grateful to the Maryland General Assembly for their support of and commitment to this effort.

At the heart of our campaign is a simple but powerful truth: Care must flow both ways. Our health care professionals dedicate their lives to caring for others; they deserve care, compassion and protection in return.
When we support the well-being of our health care workforce, we reinforce the entire system of care that touches every Marylander’s life. Respecting and safeguarding those who care for us ensures they can continue to do what they do best — deliver exceptional care to patients and families across the state.
Most people will never witness the kinds of stressors and confrontations that health care workers may face during high-pressure moments, but their impact is real. Addressing this issue is not about sounding an alarm; It’s about strengthening the foundation of our health care system. There are benefits to every patient at the hospital when violence against health care workers is prevented.
Our campaign website, ItTakesPatients.org, provides tools and resources for patients and families, plus hospitals, physician offices, urgent care and other settings of care. Through the website, as well as on billboards and buses, TV and digital ads, Marylanders can hear and see directly from health care workers who have been impacted by workplace violence in medical settings.
Their stories are real, raw and emotional.
It’s not easy to talk, or hear, about any workplace violence, but what Marylanders will also hear is their love for their work and their gratitude for the opportunity to help others.
To the health care professionals who show up every day with courage and compassion: We see you, we thank you and we are working to ensure your safety is a priority.
To the public and our elected leaders: This is an opportunity to stand with the people who care for us — to build a stronger, safer health care system that supports the well-being of both patients and providers. Together, we can ensure that Maryland leads the way in protecting our health care workforce while maintaining the trust and care our communities count on.
Since the Maryland Patient Safety Center was created by the Maryland General Assembly in 2002, we have worked for a future where health care is safe and equitable for every patient, family member and health care worker, across the care continuum. The Care Flows Both Ways campaign continues and expands that commitment to our state’s health care family.
Our aim is to keep healing the central part of the workplace for our health care heroes. We invite everyone to join us as we learn how to make “Care Flow Both Ways.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-52212092-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 03:00:18.825887

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA bill aimed at boosting safety in Georgia schools and another banning transgender girls from girls’ school sports teams were among a raft of priority education legislation signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp Monday.
“As the parents of three daughters, (First lady Marty Kemp) and I know just how important it is to keep our children safe and to give them the best possible start in life,” Kemp said. “That’s why I’m proud to sign these bills that will further safeguard our classrooms, both from those with violent intentions and from out-of-touch political agendas.”
As Kemp signed House Bill 268, he was backed by Winder Republican Rep. Holt Persinger, the bill’s sponsor, and other members of the Barrow County community, which includes Apalachee High School. Apalachee High saw Georgia’s deadliest school shooting last year, in which two teachers and two students were killed and another nine were injured.
The bill was crafted as a response to the shooting and contains a number of provisions intended to decrease the likelihood of a similar attack. It requires schools to implement a panic button system that would allow employees to instantly contact authorities in case of an emergency. Apalachee began using a panic button system just a week before the shooting, and some have credited the devices with allowing law enforcement to react quickly enough to prevent more people from being killed.
The bill also requires schools to share data when a student transfers within five school days. The accused teenage shooter at Apalachee had allegedly been interviewed by the FBI in connection with shooting threats at another district more than a year before the attack, but those allegations did not follow him to Barrow County.
The most controversial element of the bill was stripped out before it passed the Legislature. Originally, it would have created a statewide database of students who might pose a threat to school safety. Opponents cited privacy concerns, saying that a student who made an idle threat against a classmate or another immature but harmless mistake could have their future opportunities threatened.

Education bills signed by Gov. Kemp Monday
Senate Bill 1 – Prohibits student athletes from playing on teams designated for the other gender and requires restrooms, locker rooms and sleeping areas to be single-gender at sporting events.
House Bill 81 – Establishes an interstate compact for school psychologists to make it easier for professionals from other states to work in Georgia.
House Bill 307 – Consolidates existing statutory requirements for dyslexia screening to reach students earlier.
House Bill 235 – Allows education workers to receive a leave of absence to donate organs or bone marrow.
Senate Bill 82 – Encourages local school boards to approve charter school petitions.
Senate Bill 123 – Mandates the creation of review teams for school systems with high rates of chronic absenteeism.
House Bill 268 – Requires schools to have up-to-date mapping and panic buttons, requires school records for transfer students to be transferred within five days, requires districts to provide anonymous safety reporting programs, creates new safety positions and new offenses for making threats against a school.

The panic button portion of the safety bill was originally titled Ricky and Alyssa’s Law after Richard Aspinwall, a teacher and coach who died in the Apalachee shooting and Alyssa Alhadeff, who was killed in the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
Members of both families were on hand for the signing.
Aspinwall’s father-in-law Kevin Zinke said the ceremony was bittersweet.
“We’re happy that the governor decided to sign it, but this whole thing has been a rollercoaster ride,” he said. “You’re just happy about something like this, but none of us should be here right now. None of us should be here for this. This could have all been prevented.”
Alyssa’s parents, Lori and Ilan Alhadeff, have been traveling the country advocating for panic button mandates. Georgia is the eighth state to pass such a law. Ilan Alhadeff called the buttons his daughter’s legacy.
“She was inherently very protective of everyone around her. She always brought the crowds and was always defensive of everyone in her circle, and this is so nice to see and so vitally important to see that we’re able to save lives. In the Apalachee shooting, it saved lives. A panic alert went off, and if it was not for that, more children and staff could have been killed that day. So this is just a clear example of how it saved lives. If it was there in 2018, our daughter would be here with us today.”
Coach Aspinwall’s father, who is also named Richard Aspinwall, said he’s glad for the provisions that passed, but he said he hopes to see the database portion become law as well.
“We’re going to keep working on that. You can’t expect somebody to be blindsided with a problem,” he said.
Senate Bill 1 was one of the most controversial bills of this year’s session, which ended early this month.
Also known as the Riley Gaines Act after a college swimmer who lost a tournament at Georgia Tech to a transgender swimmer, the bill bans transgender athletes from playing on team sports designated for their gender identity at all grade levels, including college. It also requires separate restroom, locker room and sleeping facilities for men and women at athletic events and sets up a way to legally challenge schools that violate the law.
Supporters say the measure will ensure women and girls can find safety and fair play on the field.
“This common sense legislation is about what is fair and safe for our children,” Kemp said. “Girls should not have to share a playing field, a restroom or locker room with boys. I know I learned a lot of valuable lessons about life on the football field and the baseball diamond growing up, and it’s not right to ask kids today to forgo those lessons when facing someone biologically stronger and faster than them.”
Opponents call the bill and other legislation taking away rights from transgender people attempts to score political points by going after a vulnerable group.
The Georgia High School Association and NCAA already ban transgender athletes from playing in women’s sports, and President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year banning transgender participation in women’s sports.
Bentley Hudgins, state director with the Human Rights Campaign, said GOP legislators shot down Democratic efforts to boost girls’ sports, including Senate Bill 41, which aimed to equalize funding, access and equipment between girls’ and boys’ school sports.
“Instead of addressing the real problems young women and girls face on the playing field, they chose to bully trans kids and put all girls in harm’s way,” they said. “Their absurd attacks on kids are tired and don’t help anyone. While Republicans play political games and bully transgender children, they cannot and will not steal our joy.”

(Photo by Ronen Tivony/NurPhoto via Getty Images)After years of legal wrangling, former Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is free of any state ethics violation charges.
The Executive Branch Ethics Commission, which brought charges against her in 2021, has decided not to try to appeal to the Kentucky Supreme Court last month’s unanimous decision by the Kentucky Court of Appeals to uphold a lower court order that cleared Grimes of any wrongdoing.
With no appeal to the state’s highest court from the commission within 30 days, the appellate court finalized its decision on April 21.
“There are no legal charges any more against her, and there never should have been any,” her attorney, Jon Salomon of Louisville, said Monday night.
The end of the legal case could opens the door for a possible run for another political office. The Democrat is seen by some Kentucky political observers as a possible candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2026 or Central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District next year.
Grimes is a Lexington lawyer who was secretary of state from 2011 to 2019 and was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2014 against Republican Mitch McConnell. She is the daughter of the former state Democratic Party Chair Jerry Lundergan of Lexington. The Lundergan family is close to former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Grimes did not return phone calls seeking comments about her legal victory and political future.
Susan Clary, executive director of the ethics commission, had no comment Monday night when asked why the commission did not ask the Kentucky Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals’ decision.
The commission had been investigating Grimes for several years.
In November 2021, the commission fined Grimes $10,000 for two ethical violations pertaining to handling of voter data.
As secretary of state, Grimes was the state’s chief elections officer. In her position, she had access to data from the state voter registration system in the State Board of Elections.
The commission had alleged that Grimes violated the ethics code by sharing voter information without requiring a request under the Open Records Act or other “established process of government.”
Grimes responded that all the voter data at issue was information in the public domain and that she had full legal authority and discretion as secretary of state to access and share such information. She claimed no statute or regulation was violated by the sharing of such public information. She claimed the commission’s charges were barred by the five-year statute of limitations and that the record did not support a finding of any violations of the state executive branch’s code of ethics.
The commission argued that it was not bound by any statute of limitations and claimed that a limitation could hamper its work on other cases.
The only allegations pursued by the Ethics Commission were that Grimes allegedly acted unethically in accessing public information in the voter registration system by downloading voter information onto a thumb drive when she was a candidate for reelection.
The commission also looked at whether Grimes improperly shared information on new voter registrations for certain Kentucky House of Representative districts in response to a request made informally through the office of the House speaker without requiring a formal open records request or charging a fee.
Grimes fought the charges in Franklin Circuit Court and Judge Phillip Shepherd ruled in her favor.
Then the three-member appellate court said last month that the Executive Branch Ethics Commission missed its statutory deadline to charge Grimes with improperly ordering the downloading and distribution of voter registration data from her public office while she was Kentucky’s secretary of state.
“The Franklin Circuit Court reversed the commission’s decision, finding it was arbitrary, not supported by substantial evidence and time barred. Due to the statute of limitations alone, we affirm,” said the appellate court decision. The three appellate judges were Susanne M. Cetrulo, James H. Lambert and Jeff S. Taylor.
Salomon, Grimes’ attorney, noted that the final order contained a “To Be Published” provision, meaning that the case sets precedent in law.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-824504630-594x594-1.jpg,,,2025-04-29 01:01:26.451939

FRANKFORT, Ky. – A big reason why Congressman Andy Barr swamped former Attorney General Daniel Cameron in the first phase of fundraising as each seeks the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate is that Barr got a windfall of contributions from traditional political action committees —particularly from bank PACs.
The numbers can be found on Line 11(c) of the reports Barr and Cameron filed recently with the Federal Election Commission detailing their contributions between Jan. 1 and March 31.
That line on the Andy Barr for Senate report shows $733,000 in contributions from PACs.
The same line on the Cameron for Senate report shows $1,000.
Barr’s PAC windfall represents 40 percent of the $1,853,000 in total receipts he reported for the three-month period. Cameron reported total receipts of $508,000 for the period.
Barr’s lead in fundraising is actually much larger because — in addition to the money raised in the first quarter — he rolled over a balance of about $3.7 million from his House campaign committee to the new committee for the Senate. Barr’s Senate campaign reported having more than $5.3 million on hand at this start of this month while Cameron’s report shows it had $455,000 on hand on April 1.
Barr and Cameron are seeking the Republican Party nomination to succeed Sen. Mitch McConnell who announced in February that he would not seek reelection in 2026. Others may join the race. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported last week that some Republican insiders are saying Scott Jennings, a political consultant best known as a pro-Donald Trump commentator on CNN, is considering getting in the race. And others might get in, including wealthy Lexington businessman Nate Morris.
Barr may need more campaign money than Cameron, who released a poll earlier this month showing he enjoyed a strong lead over Barr — a lead political experts attributed to his higher statewide name recognition that resulted from his 2019 election as attorney general, his four years serving as attorney general, and his 2023 campaign for governor which he lost to incumbent Democrat Andy Beshear.

Barr has won seven consecutive elections as U.S. representative but his name is not well known outside central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District.
Barr’s strong support from traditional PACs is the result of his years in the House, particularly now as a member of the majority party while holding important committee assignments.
Stephen Voss, an associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky who specializes in Kentucky politics, said most experienced members of Congress, regardless of political affiliation, can expect a steady flow of donations from traditional PACs. “Andy Barr has been influential in the banking and finance sector for years now, and PACs tend to reward longterm relationships,” Voss said.
Traditional PACs — organizations representing corporations, associations, labor unions and other groups  —are limited by law to giving no more than $5,000 per election. The limit is effectively $10,000 because a PAC can give $5,000 designated to a candidate’s primary election, and $5,000 designated to the general election.
Barr is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee and chairs its Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy Subcommittee. He also serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
The website of OpenSecrets, a non-profit organization that tracks and analyzes political contributions, shows that in the past four years Barr’s campaign committee has gotten the largest share of its contributions from the “securities and investment” sector of the economy and the second largest share from “commercial banks.”
PACs of many corporations and associations within those sectors also gave generously to Barr in the first three months of this year. Kentucky Lantern’s review of Barr’s recent report shows that 17 PACs of banks or financial services associations gave the maximum $10,000 during the period.
Those are the PACs of: American Bankers Assn.; American Financial Services Assn.; Ally Financial Inc.; Barclays Group US Inc.; Fifth Third Bancorp; Financial Services Institute; Goldman Sachs Group Inc.; Investment Company Institute; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Managed Funds Assn.; Nomura Holding America Inc.; PNC Financial Services Group; Securities Industry and Financial Markets Assn.; Truist Financial Corp.; UBS Americas Inc.; U.S. Bancorp; and United Wholesale Mortgage.
Many other PACs of banks and financial institutions gave smaller amounts. But Barr got lots of contributions from PACs outside the banking sector during the period.

Here are the other PACs listed as donating $10,000 to Barr during the first quarter:

American Institute of CPAs
American Property Casualty Insurance Assn.
Beam Suntory Inc.
Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers
Deloitte
Elevance Health Inc.
Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America Inc.
KPMG Partners/Principals and Employees
Marathon Petroleum Employees
National Apartment Assn.
National Beer Wholesalers
PriceWaterhouseCoopers
Sazerac Company Inc.

Many other PACs gave smaller amounts. Barr’s Congressional office referred questions from Kentucky Lantern to his Senate campaign committee, which did not return an email and a phone message. Cameron’s FEC report lists only one PAC contribution: $1,000 from an obscure political group called Red State PAC, of Nashville.
Guthrie got more PAC money than Barr
Kentucky’s 2nd District Congressman Brett Guthrie, a Republican from Bowling Green who apparently has no current aspirations for higher office, reported getting hundreds of PAC contributions to his campaign committee in the first quarter of 2025 totaling $826,500.

The $826,500 represented 72% of all contributions during the period to Guthrie, who last December was named chairman of the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
Guthrie first won election to the U.S. House in a close election in 2008. Since then he has never seriously been threatened. Last November he won reelection with 73.1% of the vote.
And over time his campaign fund has become less of committee to raise and spend money for his reelection expenses and more of a clearing house that collects contributions from traditional PACs and gives most of it to the Republican National Congressional Committee.
FEC records show that in the 2023-24 campaign cycle it took in $2.4 million from traditional PACs – 74 percent of its total contributions. FEC records also show that in the same period it gave $3.1 million to the NRCC – 64 percent of its total spending.
McConnell Money Machine winding down
U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell’s well-oiled fundraising machine is beginning to shut down. Kentucky’s senior senator announced on Feb. 20 he would not seek reelection. And his campaign committee reported to the FEC last week that it stopped online fundraising and will refund contributions designated for the 2026 general election as required by law.
After those refunds the McConnell for Senate Committee is expected to still have a balance of well over $7 million.
The law prevents retiring senators and representatives from keeping that money or paying for personal expenses. But McConnell has other options, primarily donating the money to political committees or to charities.
McConnell Senate Committee launched in the early 1980s an underdog’s effort to unseat an incumbent Democrat and went on – FEC records show – to raise more than $150 million  that financed seven winning elections to the U.S. Senate.

The committee was the heart and the origin of McConnell’s fundraising machine which – once McConnell secured his seat in the U.S. Senate – also took on the role of raising hundreds of millions of additional dollars (through the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the super PAC Senate Leadership Fund) with the goal of gaining and retaining Republican control of the U.S. Senate.
McConnell likes “The Price of Power”
Among the relatively few spending items listed in McConnell for Senate’s recent report is $4,467.37 it paid on Feb. 26 to the publishing house Simon & Schuster, of New York, for books.
Last fall Simon & Schuster published “The Price of Power, How Mitch McConnell Mastered the Senate, Changed America and Lost His Party” by veteran journalist Michael Tackett. (The book was favorably reviewed in Kentucky Lantern by Kentucky journalist Al Cross.)Kentucky Lantern confirmed the payment was for copies of “The Price of Power.”
The $4,467.37 payment would buy about 130 copies of the book at its list price.
‘Tis The Season

	
It’s that time of year when political committees of politicians include big payments to Churchill Downs.
Hal Rogers for Congress reported three payments to Churchill in February and March totaling $95,979. His report says the payments were for ‘facility rental.”
Friends of Andy Barr, a Barr committee that collects contributions for several Barr committees, reported paying $60,450 to Churchill. It also says the purpose of the disbursement was for “facility rental.”
Study in contrasts: Racing, breeding shine in Kentucky as sport dims across America

Rand Paul for Senate paid $40,026 in February to Churchill for “event tickets.”
No special trips for Sen. Paul, but …
Kentucky Lantern has reported that Sen. Paul’s campaign committee spent $50,000 last summer for a fundraising trip to Scandinavia’s finest hotels and restaurants, and it spent $44,240 for a fundraising stay at Pendry Park City, a luxury ski resort in Utah.
Paul’s campaign fund reported no travel expenses as large or unusual as those during the first three months of this year. However, it did include a couple additional expenses apparently related to last winter’s ski trip: $1,656 paid to Snowbound Transportation, of Park City, and $2,000 to Diego Zapata, a private chef and caterer from Salt Lake City.
The Paul campaign also reported paying $2,879 in March to The Breakers, a resort in Palm Beach, Florida. That was apparently to attend the annual National Republican Senatorial Committee’s winter meeting – a trip Paul takes at his campaign’s expense each year.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 04:01:31+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s psychedelic reform is not cannabis justice,Josiah Schlee,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/cts-psychedelic-reform-is-not-cannabis-justice/,"If Connecticut lawmakers want to claim moral leadership on drug reform, then they need to take meaningful action on cannabis — action that centers people, not profit.","Connecticut lawmakers recently advanced a bill to decriminalize small amounts of psilocybin, the psychoactive compound found in “magic mushrooms.” The bill, HB 7065, was celebrated by some as a forward-thinking, therapeutic step toward a more humane drug policy.
And yet, I find myself asking: Why psilocybin? Why now? Why is this bill moving forward while cannabis justice — long overdue and already legally enacted in spirit — continues to stall?
The answer, I believe, lies in a pattern that’s becoming increasingly familiar in Connecticut politics: bold-sounding reform that doesn’t challenge power, doesn’t upset profit structures, and doesn’t truly redistribute opportunity. It’s a recurring script. Progress is welcomed when it’s symbolic and easy. But when it starts to disrupt bureaucratic control or corporate cannabis monopolies, the door quietly closes.
To be clear, I support decriminalization of psilocybin. I support any effort that removes criminal penalties from nonviolent personal use of plant or fungi-based substances. What I don’t support is pretending that psilocybin reform is a substitute for the real, hard work of cannabis justice — particularly when nonviolent cannabis offenders remain incarcerated in our state, medical cannabis patients continue to be overlooked, and communities devastated by prohibition are still being told to wait.
Let’s talk about what’s been buried.
HB 5429 was a modest but important bill designed to protect medical cannabis patients and caregivers. It proposed expanding home cultivation rights, capping excessive lab testing fees, and reinforcing anti-discrimination protections — especially in housing and employment. These are not radical changes; they’re updates needed to preserve a medical program that has been neglected since the adult-use market came online.
Even more critical was HB 6377, a wide-reaching justice and equity proposal. It would have ended ongoing investigations and prosecutions for nonviolent cannabis offenses, automatically expunged criminal records, and created a framework for reviewing — and potentially vacating — sentences for those still behind bars. It also required that 50% of new cannabis licenses go to individuals with past convictions or from communities disproportionately targeted by enforcement. The bill aimed to turn promises of equity into actual policy.
Neither bill received a vote.
Meanwhile, HB 7065 sailed through the Judiciary Committee. And while it may be framed as “decriminalization,” it still allows police to seize and destroy psilocybin and penalize possession with fines up to $500. Cultivation remains fully criminalized. No provision exists for safe access, safe supply, or therapeutic integration. The law creates a new source of revenue through civil enforcement — essentially replacing incarceration with profitable punishment. That’s not restorative justice. It’s a branding exercise.
So why psilocybin and not cannabis? Why did a Schedule I psychedelic advance while more practical  and  familiar  reforms  were ignored?
One reason is simple: there’s less money at stake. Psilocybin doesn’t have a billion-dollar industry behind it — yet. There are no multistate operators competing for licenses, no state departments seeking to regulate therapeutic mushroom clinics, no entrenched financial interests to protect.
Supporting psilocybin costs nothing politically. Cannabis, on the other hand, is already a market — a market controlled by a few and heavily regulated by the Department of Consumer Protection (DCP), which has shown a preference for centralized control over community  empowerment.
Releasing prisoners, expunging records, and opening up the license structure threatens that model. Reforming cannabis policy in Connecticut means redistributing power, not just changing the optics. That kind of reform is much harder to pass — not because it lacks merit, but because it disrupts comfort.
Then there’s perception. Psychedelics have undergone a cultural rebrand. They’re now associated with therapy, trauma healing, mental wellness, and micro-dosing executives in Silicon Valley.
Cannabis still carries political baggage — linked in the public imagination to over-policing, incarceration, and street-level drug enforcement. Lawmakers would rather ride the new wave of psychedelic hype than untangle the mess they helped create around cannabis.
I don’t write this as someone looking to tear down progress. I write this as someone who has supported reform for years — who has watched Connecticut legalize cannabis without ever truly legalizing the people who used it first. I write this as someone who sees the same communities left out of licensing, left out of policy writing, left out of profit, and left behind in prison. That’s not legalization. That’s selective permission.
If we want to be honest about drug policy reform, we have to be honest about who benefits. We have to ask why symbolic legislation moves forward while substantive justice is delayed. We have to be willing to acknowledge when the appearance of progress is being used to cover for a lack of courage.
It’s no longer enough to decriminalize one substance while maintaining punishment for others. It’s no longer acceptable to protect corporations over caregivers or state regulators over patients. If Connecticut lawmakers want to claim moral leadership on drug reform, then they need to take meaningful action on cannabis — action that centers people, not profit.
HB 7065 may be a step. But it is not the step we most urgently need.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The cost of college and the weight of dreams,Kwasi Osei-Amankwah,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/the-cost-of-college-and-the-weight-of-dreams/,Thousands of students must work their way through college because their families don't have the means to support them.,"When I was in my freshman year at UConn, my mother – who had immigrated to the U.S. from Ghana and worked as a nurse for more than 35 years – became very ill. I was doing so well at school, but as soon as I got that call in early November, the financial burden of attending college as an out-of-state student loomed very large.
Just a year before, in 2020, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, we all saw a renewed movement advocating for racial justice and equality. I was still in high school, and the event served as a catalyst for my passion for journalism.


I found myself inspired and motivated to express my emotions and thoughts on what could be better, especially as an African American navigating life in a town that was predominantly non-Black. I was determined to study journalism and capture stories that matter, and this ambition quickly became my dream. The price to attend UConn before financial aid and waivable fees is $62,323. My mother and brother stood firmly by my side, encouraging me to chase my dreams and make our family proud. 
But now that my mother was sick, just a month or so into my college career, the narrative had switched. It became a matter of me needing to take care of myself in order to help my family manage in her absence.

Kwasi Osei-Amankwah
Throughout my four years at the university, I’ve worked at multiple jobs to support myself, with my highest-paying positions being at Sally’s Apizza and Haven Hot Chicken. And while I will forever remain thankful to these jobs for taking me in during my time of need, earning about $20 an hour was not even close to enough. My mother’s ongoing illness meant I had to shoulder the burden of my tuition on my own while also supporting my family at home in their time of need, paying for food and managing utilities at 18 years old.
In college, students are encouraged to fully immerse themselves in their studies while at the same time participating in a bunch of extracurricular activities and internships in order to build networks, gain invaluable experience and improve their craft of choice. Yet for those like me, managing a rigorous academic schedule while working nearly full time – especially in an industry that doesn’t have anything to do with my future ambitions – achieving this balance can feel nearly impossible.
Allison Wall, a dear friend and fellow student studying natural resources and the environment at UConn, echoed my struggles. “I have loans that cover a significant portion of my tuition, but I also have car payments, rent, repaying those loans,” she said. “There are days when I barely eat.”
Ageu Dos Santos, another UConn student, often has to work late and can’t get up for classes in the morning. “I have to hope and pray that these customers don’t come in. Otherwise, I have to stay in late and not be able to get up for class; I don’t get paid enough to worry about this.”
Thousands of students share stories like ours, and for the most part, their voices are entirely unheard. These are individuals whose families cannot help them with their education costs due to financial constraints. And no matter what the reason, it can’t be fair to put this strain on a young person straight out of high school. Students should be able to achieve their dreams no matter where they decide to end up going to school.
While the university provides some resources, such as food pantries and clothing initiatives, the outreach to help students find these programs is insufficient. I often found myself scouring UConn’s barrage of Daily Digest emails for any hope of assistance, whether financial or emotional. And when I reached out to the financial aid office for additional support, I was met with so much disappointment. They informed me that I had exhausted my options and could not receive further help. The only option I was given was to take out a private loan. I hadn’t done that during my time at UConn until this year, when I had no choice.
As I prepare to graduate this semester, I take so much pride in the journey I’ve been on. I carry with me the lessons of resilience, as well as acquiring some of the journalism skills I needed. I daily remember the struggles I overcame to get to this point. Yet, I cannot shake the feeling that financing an education should never be this arduous. I can’t help but worry that because of the situation I’ve been in, I won’t find a job easily at all, not because of skills I haven’t acquired but because of the lack of true experience I have.
I want to be someone in this world. My passion and drive make me this way, and while no one can predict these circumstances, the reality of potentially repaying student loans for the entirety of my life feels overwhelming. No one should have to face such daunting challenges.
College costs money for a reason. This isn’t an article about making college free. As a student, I covered many issues similar to this one for class assignments. I always got led to the same statement:
“The things students enjoy cost money.”
I understand that a lot of the things cost money. But I don’t have the time to enjoy said things. There should be something more that universities across the country could do for students like me, who were just dealt a bad hand and couldn’t do anything about it.
The solution of loan forgiveness has been really big in helping students after college, but this is a process that should be expanded upon, not taken away as the Trump administration is threatening – giving students more access to the education they need.
Because of my journey, I’ve missed out on internships and valuable experience that would’ve helped me advance in life. This feeling of hopelessness after all the sacrifices people have made goes to show all the deeper issues in this country. How a student, who’s a person of color, can’t make it during this stage of life because of the lack of connections, the lack of time, and because my parents weren’t born here. I work tirelessly each day to make something of myself because of the promises I made to my mother. The feeling that I’m not getting that fair chance, the feeling of failure, scares me.
My mom is slowly doing better physically, but mentally I worry if she’ll ever be the same. She’s 60 years old now, and many years of working as a single mother have taken their toll. My father told me that they’re planning to retire back to Ghana after reuniting with my mother following her illness. They have completed their attempt at that “American Dream” so many immigrants around the world chase for generations.
I’ve battled and fought through an experience. I will never let something like this hinder me. My mission has always been to make things easier for people like me — first-generation students, people who struggle to pay for college, people of color, anyone that feels like they’re not getting the love they need.
My last shift, I worked 13 hours. During that time, I had a guest visit my job who was touring UConn with their daughter from Long Island. Strangers. When they told me how proud they were that I was graduating, it sparked the brightest smile within me. I hope to make people feel that sense of pride in my writing, perfect my craft, and make my family proud. I need to make all the hard work worth it.

The local chamber announced, in a media release, its participation in the relaunch of the Business for Federal Research Funding Coalition. Nearly 30 states are represented so far.
“Federal research funding is one of the best investments we can make in America’s future,” said Heath Mello, president and CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber. “It drives groundbreaking innovation, fuels job creation, strengthens our national competitiveness and directly impacts the Omaha region.”

Formed in 2017, the national coalition went dormant during the Biden Administration, a chamber official said, because funding levels for federal research were sufficient.
Now the nonpartisan coalition of business organizations “from red, blue and purple states” will once again engage members of Congress and the Trump Administration to reinforce the stance that research funding “strengthens our nation’s economy and competitiveness.”
The Omaha-area chamber represents nearly 3,000 member businesses. Representatives said the University of Nebraska system last year received more than $113 million, and Omaha-based Creighton University received nearly $8.3 million in National Institute of Health grants.
Investments in research have led to major breakthroughs in innovation, new technologies, life-saving medical treatments and millions of jobs, the chamber release said. 
The BFRF said that nationally, $36.9 billion in NIF grants awarded to researchers in 2024 supported 407,782 jobs and generated $94.5 in economic activity.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s public schools might get more money, after all. 
Nine days after Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed a significant increase to the state’s K-12 public school funding formula, the Alaska Senate has approved a compromise education bill that includes a smaller increase.
The bill includes some — but not all — of the policy changes that Dunleavy said were necessary to prevent another veto.
House Bill 57, originally drafted to restrict public school students’ cellphone use, was amended by the Senate before being approved on a bipartisan, 19-1 vote, and must return to the House for a concurrence vote. 
That vote could have taken place on Monday, but lawmakers found a technical error with the bill, meaning that the Senate must revote on a new text before the House can act. 
The new Senate vote and the House’s concurrence are expected on Wednesday.
When that happens, it will be the third time in two years that the Alaska Legislature has attempted to increase the state’s per-student funding formula.
While the first two attempts were defeated by the governor and Republicans who voted to sustain his vetoes, this third attempt appears to have stronger support among legislative Republicans.
On Monday, five members of the six-person Senate Republican minority hailed the bill, and three said they were prepared to override the governor. Two others said they might do so as well.
“We believe that we have struck the most reasonable compromise we’re going to find this year to get something true that’s going to work,” said Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla.

Included in the bill is a $700 per student increase to the base student allocation, the foundation of the state’s public school funding formula. 
For years, legislators have tried to adjust the formula to keep up with inflation. If the formula were to be adjusted for inflation since 2011, it would have to rise by $1,808 per student. In recent years, districts have had to slash programs and staff, and public school advocates have cited the lack of BSA increases as a cause. During the same period, public-school enrollment has fallen. 
Last year, lawmakers included a one-time funding bonus for public schools in the state budget. That was equivalent to a $680 increase to the BSA. The new funding is only a small year-over-year bump — from $174 million to $183 million, given 2024 class sizes — but it’s particularly important, said Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, because it’s part of the foundation formula, which means schools can count on that figure when they write their budgets.
“When it’s inside the BSA, not only can they plan long-term … but it also forces this accountability metric,” she said, explaining that districts will be required to account for their spending differently than if they were receiving a one-time bonus.
The bill also includes more money for pupil transportation programs — school bus services, generally — and it designates the proceeds of a proposed corporate tax update for a program intended to improve younger students’ reading skills.
That section of the bill states that schools would be eligible for at least $450 for each student who passes specific skill thresholds.

That provision, plus stronger prohibitions on student cellphones, were important to Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, and caused her to vote for the bill. She had voted against the bill that was vetoed by Dunleavy.
“I don’t want children to miss out on … primarily the cellphone ban. I think that will be a game changer with middle and high schoolers. You will see academic improvements as a result of that one policy. The reading incentives, that will also be a game changer. And for those reasons, I don’t want to hold back,” she said.
Conversely, Sen. Robert Myers, R-North Pole, was the only “no” vote on the bill and said that while he and Hughes have similar views, he thinks the designated funding mechanism is unreliable and may be unconstitutional.
The House-passed version of HB 57 only required school districts to set a policy for student cellphone use. The Senate-passed version says that if a district doesn’t have a policy, students are banned from using them in school.
Other changes:

People who want to propose new charter schools can do so at any time of year;
Local school boards must decide charter school applications more quickly, and if an application is rejected, the state school board must act more quickly to decide whether to overrule local officials;
A school board decision to create a charter school can be terminated only for specific reasons; 
School districts must set targets for class sizes. The target for prekindergarten through grade 6 cannot exceed 23 students per class, and the target for 7th through 12th grades cannot exceed 30 students per class.

Asked on Monday whether the governor was willing to allow the revised bill to become law, Tobin said she wasn’t sure. She also said she wasn’t sure whether there would be enough votes to override a prospective veto.
“I’ve been working my ass off, so I’m hopeful,” she said.

In the state with the fourth-largest proven reserves of oil and gas in the U.S., there is a looming energy shortage.
Above the Arctic Circle, oil producers on Alaska’s North Slope send an average of 465,000 barrels of crude oil south each day for shipping to refineries and users around the country and the world.
But in Southcentral Alaska – Anchorage and the surrounding region, home to 63% of the state’s population – utility companies are warning they may not have enough natural gas from current sources to keep the power and heat on without interruption.
As a professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage who studies the economics of natural resources, I can see this apparent contradiction has a straightforward cause but no simple solution.

Declining oil production
The North Slope region once produced nearly 2 million barrels of oil per day at its peak in the 1980s. Every barrel is transported via the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to the port of Valdez, where it is loaded onto tanker ships.
The state government collects significant taxes and royalties on oil production. For decades, oil revenue allowed the state to fund all government spending without imposing broad-based income, sales or property taxes. At the height of the oil boom, there was so much money that Alaska established a wealth fund, now valued at over US$80 billion, and began distributing dividends to every resident.
But the Trans-Alaska Pipeline is designed to carry oil, not natural gas. A state law prevents producers from burning off excess gas, or flaring, as happens in many fields. With nowhere to send it, gas extracted from Alaska’s oil fields is reinjected into the ground to boost well pressure and push more oil out.
Significant natural gas potential
Alaska’s gas reserves are significant. State estimates suggest the North Slope has about 35 trillion cubic feet of proven reserves. That’s almost as much natural gas as the U.S. as a whole produced in 2023.
But that is just the beginning: The North Slope also has the potential for another 200 trillion cubic feet that remains undiscovered. And improving technologies and techniques may be able to extract another 590 trillion cubic feet, according to the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., a company owned by the state of Alaska that is trying develop a project to extract and sell the state’s natural gas.
As oil production declines and prices remain uncertain, selling gas could provide a different stream of revenue for the state, potentially providing billions of dollars.
The 800-mile problem
For decades, there have been numerous proposals to develop Alaska’s gas. State agencies and the petroleum industry have collectively spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this effort.
The concept that’s closest to reality is Alaska Gasline Development Corp.’s proposal to build a plant on the North Slope to remove gas impurities, a liquefaction plant near Anchorage that could export 20 million tons of liquefied gas each year – around a trillion cubic feet – and an 807-mile pipeline to connect the two.
The cost is expected to be significant: The corporation’s own estimate is that it would cost $44 billion. But that number was developed before the construction sector saw significant inflation in 2022. An engineering study due for release in late 2025 will provide a more updated figure. Alaskans remember that the Trans-Alaska Pipeline ended up costing 25% more than projected.
Since his first day in office, President Donald Trump has touted this pipeline as part of efforts to expand the nation’s production of fossil fuels. He told a joint session of Congress it was a near-ready project, with Japan and South Korea ready to invest “trillions of dollars each.” In February 2025, he stood alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to announce a “joint venture” to develop the pipeline project, but no specific details have been announced.
2 expensive options
There is a growing need to address Alaska’s domestic energy shortfall.
Southcentral Alaska relies on natural gas for more than 70% of its electric and heating needs. But the gas reserves closest to Anchorage, in the Cook Inlet, which have provided energy to the area since the 1960s, are dwindling, and prices are rising. In 2005, wholesale gas prices were $3.75 per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas. By 2024, the price had more than doubled, to $8.75. By contrast, the rest of the U.S. has seen natural gas prices cut in half over that period, thanks in part to horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking.
In 2022, Hilcorp, the company responsible for roughly 85% of the Cook Inlet gas production, reported that by 2027 it might not be able to supply enough gas for utilities that serve the region.
Solutions other than the pipeline are also slow and expensive. Local utilities estimate that improving energy efficiency and developing renewable power could reduce gas demand by around 10% over the next several years and by as much as 15% after a decade. But retrofitting the area’s aging and energy-inefficient homes will not be fast or cheap.
More than just economics
What remains for Alaska are two main options: get gas from the North Slope to Anchorage, or import liquefied gas from the global market.
Building the pipeline could both meet the needs of Alaska’s people and bring in money from global sales – though how much revenue depends on how global gas markets change over time and how competitive Alaska gas prices would be relative to other suppliers.
Any delays from financial, legal, technical or environmental challenges would balloon costs. But if it succeeded, Anchorage-area customers could see prices drop as low as $2.23 per 1,000 cubic feet – a 75% drop from current prices and 40% lower than in 2005. The savings could significantly bolster the region’s economy.
Importing is a costly option. A study commissioned by the Alaska Legislature found that imported gas would cost $13.72 per 1,000 cubic feet. That’s 60% more than current prices and especially burdensome for Alaska families and businesses, which already pay far higher energy bills than typical American customers.
Beyond the economic questions, there’s something symbolic at stake: the state’s identity. Could a state synonymous with energy production become an energy importer? Many Alaskans see the prospect as an embarrassing paradox – akin to Hawaii importing pineapples or New Mexico importing green chiles.
Independence and globalization
Alaska is not alone in grappling with the tension between energy self-sufficiency and economic efficiency.
Across the U.S., states rich in resources have wrestled with the question of whether to prioritize local production or integrate into global markets. Texas produces more oil than any other state, yet it continues to import crude oil due to mismatches between its production and refining capacity.
Shaped by globalization, few regions can truly isolate themselves from market forces. Energy production and consumption are increasingly interconnected, meaning pursuit of local self-sufficiency comes at a steep economic cost. That’s the question facing Alaska: whether to invest in domestic infrastructure to maintain energy independence, or embrace the flexibility – and potentially lower cost – of global markets.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)LINCOLN — A legislative proposal to crack down on “synthetic” consumable hemp or other THC products advanced Monday over some opponents’ preference for regulations and not a “de facto ban.”
Legislative Bill 316, from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, would redefine most “hemp” products to mean “marijuana,” putting them legally in line with existing enforcement and penalties. It advances a key priority of Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers to restrict products that exceed 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrations, the compound most commonly associated with getting a person high.
“These compounds are masquerading as hemp but are in fact dangerous synthetic chemicals that have never been tested for consumption in humans,” Kauth said during debate.

‘We need to do something’
The bill advanced 33-13, though at least two supporters — State Sens. Tom Brandt of Plymouth and Ben Hansen of Blair — said the bill would need to be amended to maintain their support and overcome the 33-vote threshold for a filibuster. Three more centrist Democratic lawmakers declined to take a position on the bill: State Sens. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, Jason Prokop of Lincoln and Dan Quick of Grand Island.
Multiple opponents said they preferred the regulatory regime proposed in LB 16 by State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, the lead opponent to Kauth’s bill. Cavanaugh’s bill would need to hitch a ride on a different bill, or “co-opt” LB 316. Cavanaugh filed more than a dozen amendments to LB 316 to try.
“I’m opposed to hijacking other people’s bills, but I put it on here because I think people in this body will agree that we need to do something,” Cavanaugh said.

Cavanaugh described the goal of attacking only “synthetic” products as a “red herring,” “misnomer” and “misdirection” that would cost more than $1.6 million, at least, in state tax revenue at a time the state faces a major projected budget deficit.
However, he said his bill could generate $7.7 million with an improved regulatory system.
‘Health and safety’
State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, who selected LB 316 as his 2025 priority bill, said he repeatedly asked during a public hearing on Kauth’s bill what ingredients are in delta-8 products — a form of THC that is legal in the state under 2018 federal and 2019 state laws. He also asked where the items come from or who is manufacturing them, but “nobody could ever tell me.”
Hilgers was one of 43 lawmakers in 2019 who voted to enact the Nebraska Hemp Farming Act.
Storm said “effective regulation of this industry is impossible” and that the products are “garbage” attached to a little bit of cannabidiol (CBD) to vape, smoke or eat.
  State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, center. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Storm said he would never jeopardize “the health or safety of our citizens of this state, especially children and young adults, for revenue.” State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, chair of the Revenue Committee, agreed.
LB 316 would prohibit raw hemp above 0.3% THC of any concentration and for processed hemp the lesser of 0.3% THC on a total weight basis or 10 milligrams per package, effective Jan. 1. The mature stalks of Cannabis sativa and its fiber, oil, cake and any other naturally derived products would not be considered hemp, leaving a narrow legal path for fibers and textiles.
If the bill passed, it would include a “consumer safe harbor period” through the end of 2025 to give consumers time to discard any “illegal hemp” newly defined under LB 316. Legal products would face an additional 10% wholesale tax.
‘Felons of all the grannies’
Cavanaugh and State Sens. George Dungan of Lincoln and Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, all lawyers, said the bill creates a “gray zone” where it’s unclear what would be legal and what would be a misdemeanor or infraction for possession or a more serious felony crime.
They said it could result in a “de facto ban” as a result.
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. Jan. 23, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, a former lawyer and vice chair of the Judiciary Committee that advanced LB 316 in a 5-3 vote, said LB 316 is part of a “felony factory” where products for lotions, creams or dog chew could lead to felony charges, or in the case of gummy-eating “grannies” who she said might have such products “in the back of their medicine cabinet.”
DeBoer said a cousin recently sent her a recipe from “Taste of Home” magazine for slow cooker cannabutter as a joke as LB 316 was set to be debated.
“We’re going to make felons of all the grannies that subscribe to ‘Taste of Home’ magazine,” DeBoer said.
Brandt said it was “ridiculous” that people could face felony criminal possession charges. While he voted for the bill to move forward, he said that if the possession language was not amended, though he could not say to what extent it would need to be changed, he would not support it again.
Under state law, marijuana possession of more than 1 ounce but less than 1 pound is a Class III misdemeanor, while greater amounts are a Class IV felony. Smaller amounts can be up to a Class IIIA misdemeanor with up to a $500 fine or jailing for up to seven days for repeated infractions. 
  State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth. Aug. 13, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Brandt said he wanted to target “active ingredients” and protect Nebraskans who might have old CBD products at home that were legally purchased.
“This is hemp. This is not marijuana, guys,” Brandt said.
‘Whack-a-mole’ with regulations
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, chair of the Judiciary Committee and a former prosecutor, disagreed with DeBoer and said it was a “clarification” rather than a new penalty.
“You’re playing whack-a-mole with trying to regulate this drug,” Bosn said, saying she opposed any effort to change Kauth’s LB 316 toward Cavanaugh’s LB 16.
Bosn also read information from the AG’s Office that of an estimated 300 THC stores in Nebraska, visitors to each of the ones the AG’s Office purchased from have found at least one unlawful product. The office has filed at least 15 lawsuits, some settled, in that ongoing push.
  State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Cavanaugh said that was why regulations were needed and why “reputable” shop owners wanted new guardrails. His LB 16, in part, would prohibit sales near schools and require testing.
Dungan repeatedly referred to LB 316 as a prohibition-era law, similar to opposition to whiskey or bourbon, that didn’t prevent sales but instead created a “black market.”
“We all know history is a good predictor of the future,” Dungan said.
Medical purposes
Multiple opponents also tried to describe a link between CBD or hemp and medical cannabis legislation. Storm and others supporting LB 316 have sought to limit permissible medical cannabis forms to manufactured products like tinctures, oils or creams, while outlawing sales of cannabis flowers or buds. Dungan said that was hypocritical.
Kauth, Storm and others said LB 316 had nothing to do with medical cannabis and that even more liberal-leaning states have cracked down on THC, hemp and delta-8.

Hansen, whose LB 677 would help implement voter-approved medical cannabis, said he is working on an amendment to LB 316 to protect medical cannabis products. He said he isn’t swayed one way or another on the bill. But he said that for his support, he wanted to explicitly protect the products.
However, getting Hansen’s amendment over the finish line could be tricky around Cavanaugh’s more than a dozen amendments, and multiple motions to kill the bill if his amendments fail. 
Kauth has filed two placeholder amendments that could offer a path for changes requested by Brandt and Hansen.
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha read a letter from a Nebraskan who reached out that CBD and hemp products targeted under LB 316 gave the person’s grandfather a new life, around sleeping pills or other medications, expressing fear that the alternatives could be threatened.
“These aren’t people looking to get high,” Juarez read from the letter. “These are people looking for relief, for dignity and a better quality of life.”

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Some 112 Wisconsin workers died on the job in 2023, the AFL-CIO reported Monday as labor unions marked Workers Memorial Day to highlight workplace dangers.
“When a union is there at the workplace, injuries go down and lives are saved,” said Kevin Gundlach, president of the South Central Federation of Labor, representing union workers in Dane County and surrounding counties.
Workers Memorial Day serves both to remember those who have lost their lives at work as well as “fighting for the living” to have a safe workplace, Gundlach told the Wisconsin Examiner. The date, April 28, coincides with the anniversary of the date that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act took effect 54 years ago.
The AFL-CIO’s analysis draws on 2023 job fatality, injury and illness data along with workplace safety regulation enforcement data for the 12 months ending Sept. 30, 2024.

Of the 112 Wisconsin worker deaths in 2023, 15 were from assaults and other violent acts, 37 from transportation incidents, 17 from falls, 19 from exposures to harmful substances or environments, and 23 from “contact with objects or equipment,” according to the AFL-CIO.

“Every worker in Wisconsin has the right to a safe job,” said Wisconsin AFL-CIO President Stephanie Bloomingdale. “We need collective bargaining rights and strong unions for all to best ensure that safety concerns are adequately and timely addressed in the workplace.”
Union groups around Wisconsin held events, including in Madison, Milwaukee, Eau Claire, La Crosse and Wausau.
At the Madison event, people working in health care, construction, education and as state game wardens came out. There was also testimony on behalf of immigrant workers in the construction industry.
“Many of these workers are exploited and don’t have a union,” Gundlach said. Recent attacks on migrants have made some “fearful to speak up for workplace conditions.”
The event also called attention to workplace violence as a danger, and the need for employers to address workplace safety issues.
In its report, the AFL-CIO criticized the administration of President Donald Trump, which marks its first 100 days this week, for “totally decimating the fabric of what makes government protections work for people through attacks on job safety, public health, union rights and the independence of federal agencies.”

“What I struggle with most is that this is somehow an act of efficiency,” one stakeholder told WyoFile, adding that $40 is returned for every federal dollar invested in service in Wyoming. 
The post DOGE cuts to Americorps ‘a devastating blow to the state of Wyoming’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Following the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency’s order Friday to cancel nearly $400 million in AmeriCorps grants, organizations across Wyoming are preparing for cuts to a wide range of services including alternative education programs, agricultural extension offices, the state’s conservation corps and one community health clinic. 
As the federal agency for national service and volunteerism, AmeriCorps provides funding for organizations that offer community services. In Wyoming, those grants are administered by ServeWyoming, which also acts as a statewide hub for volunteers. 
With Friday’s announcement, however, the Trump administration is now expected to claw back dollars already appropriated by congress. 
More precisely, Wyoming stands to lose roughly $2.4 million in annual grants and scholarships, ServeWyoming Vice Chair Andrea Harrington told WyoFile. That figure doesn’t include matching state grants and individual donations that will also be lost in the process, Harrington said, nor does it reflect the impact it will have across the state. 
“Terminating funding, and thus annihilating these programs, is a devastating blow to the state of Wyoming,” Harrington wrote in a letter to Gov. Mark Gordon and the state’s federal delegation. 
Last year alone, Harrington wrote, Wyoming AmeriCorps members tutored and mentored more than 2,700 children, provided 75,000 hours of service, recruited and deployed more than 3,000 volunteers, served 200 military families and leveraged more than $1.9 million in outside funding from businesses, foundations and other sources in Wyoming. 
“Needs will go unmet in this state due to this decision,” Harrington wrote. 
The move to cut AmeriCorps grants comes amid a push by the Trump administration to shrink the size of the federal government. Wyoming’s delegation has largely backed the undertaking with its highest-ranking member, Sen. John Barrasso, previously lauding it for “addressing reckless and wasteful Washington spending.” 
Others, like Harrington, don’t see the latest round of cuts as a cost savings measure.  
“What I struggle with most is that this is somehow an act of efficiency,” Harrington told WyoFile, adding that $40 is returned for every federal dollar invested in service in Wyoming. 
“How is it efficient to cut these programs?” Harrington said. 
Neither Sens. Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis nor Rep. Harriet Hageman responded to WyoFile’s request for comment. 
“We are still getting information on the implications and the impacts of this announcement,” Michael Pearlman, Gordon’s communication director, told WyoFile in a statement. “Therefore, the governor is going to refrain from commenting at this time.”
Wyoming-based organizations that rely on AmeriCorps funding include: Agricultural Extension Offices, Phorge, SAE International, Teton Science Schools, The Science Zone, Wildflower Learning Community, Wyoming Conservation Corps, Brain Injury Advocates, The Iris Club House, Rooted in Wyoming, The Nicolaysen Art Museum, Lander Free Medical Clinic, Casper Green House Project and GrowWyo/Slow Food Sheridan. 
Up in the air
If the cuts stick, the impacts on programming will vary from a reduction in services to complete elimination, Harrington said. 
For the Wyoming Conservation Corps, the loss of funding for its AmeriCorps programming could be an unrecoverable blow to the 19-year-old organization.
“We hope not,” said John Koprowski, dean of the University of Wyoming’s Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources, which oversees the corps. “All we know right now is that we’ve been asked to pause.”
The “pause” for the Wyoming Conservation Corps means that the statewide AmeriCorps program will not be hiring a new program director. Koprowski had assumed that duty in an interim capacity to cover for an opening unrelated to DOGE. The same goes for all the other open positions and corps members — none are being filled for now. That includes six crew leaders who would have been overseeing five or six AmeriCorps members apiece, he said.
“So you’re looking at dozens of people who are impacted,” Koprowski said.
The impacts of the pause and likely cancellation of grants — the Washington Post reports it’s a “final agency action” that’s “not administratively appealable” — will extend to the organizations, federal agencies and businesses that worked with the Wyoming Conservation Corps.
“They’re fixing fences, trails, clearing debris from forests, reducing fire risk, all those kinds of good things,” Koprowski said.
Inspired by the work, oftentimes service members have gone on to build their careers and lives in the Equality State, he said. “They often become professionals here in the state,” Koprowski said. “Wyoming grows on them, and they become Wyomingites.” (Disclosure: WyoFile Reporter Mike Koshmrl who contributed to this story served as a City of Lakes Americorps volunteer in Minnesota in 2008.)
That applies to Harrington, who described her time of service with the Wyoming Conservation Corps as setting “the trajectory of my life” in her letter to the governor and the federal delegation. 
“My time of service not only made it possible for me to further my education and work experience in the state, but it also planted the seed that grew into my desire to put roots in this state, to work in this state, and to raise my family here,” wrote Harrington, who now works as an attorney. 
Federal funding for the Wyoming Conservation Corps was administered by ServeWyoming. WyoFile was unable to reach ServeWyoming’s executive director on Monday afternoon.
“It’s funding that’s been awarded already,” Koprowski said. “We’ve been told, ‘No, you should pause and you can’t move forward.’ What this means for us long-term, one can only guess.”

In Jackson Hole, the historic Teton Science Schools is in a similar situation. Since 2009, the place-based education organization has housed AmeriCorps members to help with teaching and to assist with an array of projects in the community.
“We became one of the statewide hubs for AmeriCorps, and part of that is because we have a great program,” Teton Science Schools Executive Director Wayne Turner told WyoFile. “This year we have 19 community partners in the valley.”
On Monday, ServeWyoming informed Teton Science Schools that its grant was “terminated” and that they should “pause the program,” Turner said. “Which we are doing.” 
Teton Science Schools has deployed three cohorts of AmeriCorps members, each about 15 people, annually. Historically, many of those service members have gone on to build careers in outdoor education. Some stick around Teton County and climb the ranks at Teton Science Schools.
“This is the beginning of their career,” Turner said. “Since we’ve been doing this in 2009, there’s been over 500 AmeriCorps volunteers who have come through Teton Science Schools.”

Other organizations across the state often depend on AmeriCorps VISTA members, who serve full time for one year and help with things like fundraising, grant writing, research and volunteer recruitment. This work, Harrington said, fills a costly void for organizations. 
VISTA members currently serving in Wyoming were told their positions have been terminated, effectively immediately, Harrington said.  
“It’s a slap in the face to people who’d decided to dedicate a year of life to serving and bettering their communities,” she said. “Now they’re being hung out to dry.” 
Still, Harrington said she’s cautiously optimistic Wyoming’s delegation will come through, particularly Barrasso who she said has shown repeated support for such programs. 
Plus, she said the Administrative Procedure Act allows for a seven-day objection period, and Harrington said she expects a challenge to be filed. 
“They’re not following the rules,” she said.

(Photos courtesy of the Doña Ana County Detention Center)Federal authorities arrested a former New Mexico magistrate judge and his wife on April 24 on criminal charges of evidence tampering related to the prosecution of an alleged gang member from Venezuela.
The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday announced it had charged former Doña Ana County Magistrate Jose Luis “Joel” Cano with one count of evidence tampering and his wife Nancy Cano with one count of conspiracy to tamper with evidence.
Prosecutors allege that Jose Cano told Homeland Security Investigations agents that he had destroyed a cell phone belonging to Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, a Venezuelan national prosecutors allege has ties to the Tren de Aragua gang.
HSI in February searched the Canos’ home and arrested Ortega-Lopez for illegal possession of guns and ammunition, according to the DOJ’s news release. The DOJ said agents seized three of Ortega-Lopez’s cell phones, but he told them about a fourth one, which prompted another search wherein Cano allegedly admitted to destroying it with a hammer.
“Judges are responsible for upholding our country’s laws. It is beyond egregious for a former judge and his wife to engage in evidence tampering on behalf of a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member accused of illegally possessing firearms,” U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison for the District of New Mexico said in a statement. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office is committed to dismantling this foreign terrorist organization by disrupting its criminal operations in New Mexico. That starts by prosecuting those who support gang members — including judges.”
The DOJ announced the charges against the Canos in the same news release in which they announced the arrest of a Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan for allegedly allowing a Mexican immigrant charged with domestic violence to temporarily avoid arrest by federal agents.
“The allegations against Judge Dugan and Judge Cano are serious: no one, least of all a judge, should obstruct law enforcement operations,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “Doing so imperils the safety of our law enforcement officers and undermines the rule of law. The Department of Justice will continue to follow the facts — no one is above the law.”
In the New Mexico case, immigration authorities arrested Ortega-Lopez in December 2023 in Texas for unlawfully entering the U.S., and released him in April 2024 because of overcrowding at the detention center where he was being held, according to court records.
An anonymous source in January tipped off the Homeland Security Investigations office in Las Cruces that Ortega-Lopez and two others were living in an apartment behind the Canos’ home, an HSI special agent wrote in an application for a search warrant.
The Judicial Standards Commission on March 5 petitioned the Supreme Court to suspend Cano for allegedly committing misconduct by allowing three members of the gang to live on his property in Las Cruces and to have access to firearms.
In a response, Jose Cano wrote to the Supreme Court justices that Ortega-Lopez told Nancy Cano that the trio “all had their legal papers to remain in the U.S. pending their Asylum Court hearings, which were already scheduled,” and that he had verified their court dates.
Jose Cano resigned as a magistrate judge on March 21, according to court records. The New Mexico Supreme Court on April 22 barred Cano from holding any judicial office or exercising any judicial authority. 
Both Canos are scheduled for preliminary and detention hearings Tuesday morning in federal court in Las Cruces.

According to a Politico report Friday, the Trump administration said in federal court it was reversing course and reinstating visas for many international students and alumni. A Justice Department attorney said, according to the report, that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is “developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations, and that the records for students “will remain active or shall be reactivated if not currently active, and ICE will not modify the record solely based on the [National Crime Information Center] finding that resulted in the recent SEVIS record termination.” The attorney also emphasized that ICE still has the authority to terminate a SEVIS record for other reasons.
The American Immigration Law Association estimates there were about 4,700 affected students across the country. 
UW-Madison said in a statement Monday that each of the 27 cancellations for its international students and alumni were reversed as of late afternoon Saturday, and that affected students and alumni will be able to continue their studies or post-graduation training at UW-Madison as a result.
Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin said in the statement that she was “relieved and grateful” for the development. 
“This situation was deeply troubling, upended lives and created both fear and harm,” Mnookin said. “I want to personally thank the many members of our community, along with local, state and federal officials, who worked to assist our students.”
Reported reversals started Thursday and continued through the weekend, according to UW-Madison, and similar to the cancellations, there was no explanation for the records being restored.
The institution said that it has notified the students of the most recent change to their records and that International Student Services and International Faculty and Staff Services are continuing to provide information, resources and support.
“We are pleased to see that all of our affected students and alumni have had their SEVIS records returned to active status, as it has been a difficult period for all involved,” UW- Madison International Division Dean Frances Vavrus said in a statement. “We will continue to follow this evolving situation closely throughout the summer and upcoming academic year.”
Universities of Wisconsin spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an email that there have been “a number of reversals at our universities” and that the situation remains “fluid.”
Reversals come after judges in cases across at least 23 states had issued emergency orders temporarily blocking the government’s action including in Wisconsin.
In one case, Krish Lal Isserdasani, a 21-year-old computer engineering senior from India, had his SEVIS record terminated less than a month before he was scheduled to graduate from UW-Madison. His case had noted that Isserdasani and his family have spent about $240,000 on his education at UW-Madison and he could lose $17,500 on the current semester’s tuition and would be responsible for four months of rent despite not being able to stay in the country. Isserdasani had also reported a significant psychological impact, including “difficulty in sleeping and fear that he will be placed in immediate detention and deportation.” U.S. District Judge William Conley had temporarily blocked his visa cancellation. 
In another case last week, Conley said that the government had wrongly cancelled Yue “Alison” Yang, a UW-Madison student from China, and granted her protection from deportation. 
Despite the step back by the Trump administration, the ACLU of Wisconsin is calling for injunctive relief from federal courts. The ACLU of Wisconsin filed an amicus curiae brief in two cases challenging the revocations, including Isserdasani’s case and a case recently brought by three anonymous international UW-Madison students, saying the issue isn’t “moot.”
Tim Muth, senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Wisconsin, said that “resorting to the courts is continuing to be an important check on actions that this administration is taking without regard to the human consequences on persons like the student in this case.”
In an amicus curiae brief, Muth wrote that the reversal offers “little protection” for plaintiffs and urged the Court to issue a ruling that “declaring such terminations, without due process and without compliance with applicable law and regulation, to be illegal.”
“It is clear that the recent pivot by the federal government should not moot these 100+ cases pending around the country since they are clearly able to be reversed immediately after dismissal of suits challenging them, and the present likelihood of irreparable injury to the Plaintiffs remains a going concern,” Muth wrote in the amicus curiae.
Muth told the Wisconsin Examiner that the reversals are a sign of the Trump administration’s “losing record” in these cases, but said it’s difficult to trust the Trump administration on immigration matters. 
“It’s not as if the Department of Homeland Security issued a press release or a formal statement announcing a change in policy,” Muth said. “What we had were a couple of attorneys in a couple of different cases saying the government is reactivating student status in SEVIS… Nothing official… has come out from the government. No statement of ‘Oh, we made a mistake on these 4,700 students, and we’re going to correct it. We’re so sorry.’” 
Muth said that during a hearing Monday in Isserdasani’s case Conley asked the government’s lawyer if she was authorized to say that a termination of Isserdasani SEVIS status wouldn’t happen again under the “new policy that supposedly they are developing.” 
“The government’s lawyer was unable to say that it wouldn’t happen again,” Muth said. “That is why the ACLU and… lawyers for international students around the country are saying there continues to be the need for courts to step in until there’s some legally binding correction made by the government.”
Muth said the law is “pretty clear” about when international students can lose their status. Those cases include when someone is no longer a full time student, when someone is engaging in employment that isn’t authorized by the law, lying to ICE or committing a crime of violence. He said things like traffic citations or an arrest for a charge that has been dismissed (as in the case of Isserdasani) are not authorized reasons for terminating somebody’s F1 visa status. 
“It is not something that can just be done unilaterally because the government has decided it wants to have fewer international students,” Muth said. 
The brief notes that students were provided with “vague boilerplate reasons” for their visa termination. In Isserdasani’s case, he received an email that said he was “otherwise failing to maintain status” and that he was “identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.” It states that the reasoning does not satisfy due process requirements because it doesn’t describe a student’s circumstances and students are not provided with the opportunity to defend themselves. 
In the brief, Muth also notes the recent case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident who was erroneously deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, saying that the visa cancellations for international students are part of a larger pattern of the Trump administration ignoring the due process rights — which includes being entitled to notice and the opportunity to be heard — of noncitizens. 
“The due process protections of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution are protections, not just for U.S. citizens, but they are protections for everyone residing in this country — that right not to be arbitrarily arrested, detained, kicked out of the country,” Muth said. 
Muth said he didn’t know what new policy the Trump administration could be developing.
“If they’re talking about coming up with a policy that would allow them to terminate SEVIS records in that situation, I think they would be violating the existing law set up by Congress,” Muth said. “People are entitled to what they didn’t get here, which is, if you’re going to terminate my status, tell me why, and give me a chance to object if what you are doing is contrary to law or contrary to what the facts are.”

(Photo by Getty Images)The Iowa Senate passed a bill setting new standards for pharmacy benefit managers that lawmakers said will help keep rural pharmacies in business and lower the cost of prescription drugs.
Senate File 383, passed 36-14, is the legislation passed through the committee process earlier this year limiting certain PBM business practices. Pharmacy benefit managers are companies that serve as the negotiator between drug manufacturers, pharmacies and health insurance companies for setting prescription drug costs.
The legislation would set new regulations for PBMs, including requiring pharmacies to be reimbursed for the national or state average acquisition cost of a drug — a higher reimbursement rate than many pharmacies are currently receiving, according to several workers and owners of current rural pharmacies.
Many components of the bill deal with PBM practices to pressure or force consumers to use certain pharmacies to fill a prescription. The bill specifically prohibits PBM strategies like setting different cost-sharing rates or implementing financial advantages or penalties for the use of certain pharmacies to fill a prescription. It also restricts other methods of PBMs limiting the use of certain pharmacies if that provider has agreed to participate in a person’s health benefit plan.

Earlier in the legislative session, pharmacists and supporters told lawmakers the bill would help Iowa pharmacies stay in business, linking the closure of many locally owned, rural pharmacies in recent years to PBM practices that favor mail-order prescription refills and certain pharmacy chains.
The bill was amended by the Senate Monday to define “retail pharmacies” and “pharmacy chains.” The Senate amendment also makes some changes to the language about how rebates received by a PBM on drugs are returned to a health benefit plan to reduce insurance premiums.
The bill’s floor manager Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, said the legislation was important to him because of his own experience having medicine for his father, which could only be filled by a mail-order pharmacy, get lost in the mail. He said ensuring rural pharmacies in Iowa stay in business is necessary to help keep Iowans healthy, saying local pharmacies can help address problems and adjust to the medical needs of people in their community in real time.
“We need to have a conversation about what rural health care looks like in Iowa,” Klimesh said. “And one of those main talking points about rural health care in Iowa is not only just a clinic you go to to get your check up, or the hospital you see, but the next step in that in that phase — which is the pharmacy, the pharmacy to fill your prescription.”
Many local pharmacies have closed in recent years, which Klimesh said was largely due to unfair business practices by PBMs. More than 150 Iowa pharmacies have closed in the past 10 years, and 31 closed in 2024, according to the Iowa Pharmacy Association. Klimesh said if the Legislature does not pass a bill regulating and PBM practices and improving transparency, “we are setting (Iowans) up for having no access to a pharmacy.”
“I lost four alone in my district, and once they close, they’re not going to reopen,” Klimesh said. “So this bill is a great step in the right direction to provide transparency.”
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said she supported a measure to restrict PBM business practices, but said Senate Republicans’ amended legislation would lead to consumer cost increases. She introduced an amendment that would require negotiated drug manufacture rebates exclusively go to reducing health care plan premiums. Her proposal also would require pharmacies with five or less organizations and pharmacies that are the only entity able to fill a prescription in their community receive a $10.68 dispensing fee for every prescription they fill.
Trone Garriott said she believed Klimesh’s amended bill would lead to significantly increased health insurance costs for Iowans, while her amendment would ensure Iowans do not lose access to health coverage because of efforts to regulate PBMs.
“(The amendment) does increase prices on consumers, it does increase prices on Iowa,” Trone Garriott said. “The amendment that I am presenting today has a much smaller increase. When we compare $160 increase to $6 increase, that’s a pretty big difference when it comes to folks who are working so hard to make ends meet. We have to take seriously that the PBMs have promised they’re going to pass the cost along to the consumers, and we want to shield the people of Iowa from increased costs, while protecting our small town and rural pharmacies.”
Klimesh called Trone Garriott’s amendment “PBM reform light.” He said the issues she brought up with rebates were already addressed in his amendment, stating a transparency provision in the bill “forces all rebates to flow back to the plan payer,” and said the Democratic senator’s amendment did not address issues with spread price manipulation, where PBMs charge payers like Medicaid more than a pharmacy is paid for a medication.
Trone Garriott’s amendment failed, while Klimesh’s amendment was adopted. The amended legislation heads to the House for further consideration. The House passed a companion version of the legislation through the committee process in March, but has not yet had floor debate on the measure.

Should the “governor’s mansion” be converted into a roller rink? What about a dorm for legislators with children?
Those were a couple of ideas legislators brought up in the Senate on Monday before the body voted 23-27 against Senate Joint Resolution 45, which called for a study to determine a use for the vacant executive residence.
Historically, the governors of Montana have resided in the “governor’s mansion,” a 12,000 square foot home at 2 N. Carson St. that’s part of the Capitol Complex.
But Gov. Greg Gianforte has his own residence in Helena, the official executive residence has been vacant for at least three years, and it’s in disrepair, according to reports to legislative committees.
In 2019 and 2021, the Montana Legislature appropriated a total $2.3 million for upgrades, but bids for upgrades came in higher, as much as $3.6 million instead, according to state officials.
In the meantime, resolution sponsor Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, said maintenance is costing taxpayers $100,000 a year, and it’s time for a plan.
Legislators have said interest in the property is high, at least among the citizens of Helena and some history lovers.
“We have, as you recall, $2.3 million sitting in an account that’s not being used to renovate, in some way, this building,” Dunwell said.
In a separate bill that didn’t pass earlier this session, Dunwell had suggested the residence be used as a rental for legislative staff, with priority for those with disabilities.
At the time, at least one member of the Senate State Administration Committee suggested a study might be in order instead.
On the floor Monday, Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, said it’s clear the building just needs to be torn down, and he shared one idea to save maintenance money.
“I’ll do the maintenance for $50,000 a year,” Hertz said.
Sen. Jacinda Morigeau, D-Arlee, reminded the Senate of another related plan.
In January 2024, the Governor’s Office said Gov. Greg Gianforte and Susan Gianforte bought the historic Hauser Mansion in Helena, and they plan to donate it to the state “following my service.”
But Morigeau said legislators can help the governor decide what to do with the Carson Street mansion, and she encouraged senators to vote yes on the study.
“I want to see it turned into – I don’t know – a roller rink?” Morigeau said.
Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, said he thought a dorm for legislators would be great, and he’d call dibs on a room.
Although the Senate opposed the study, Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, said the Capitol Complex Advisory Council already meets about the area, the group includes legislators, and the question doesn’t require an entire study.
“It’s not like the legislature does not have a voice in this. We do,” McKamey said.
However, in committee earlier this month, McKamey also noted the history contained in the house.
She mentioned some “two dozen hand needle-pointed chairs,” which she said need to be preserved. Dunwell said she had been advised the chairs were in storage.
In the hearing about the resolution, the Senate State Administration Committee heard the cost of getting the residence in shape — between $3.2 million and $3.6 million.
Director Misty Ann Giles had offered a piece of advice for anyone walking around in the unoccupied “governor’s mansion” owned by the state.
“If you do go over there, please don’t take off your shoes,” said Giles, head of the Department of Administration.
The carpet is from the 1950s, the plumbing is shot, the kitchen is “barely functional,” it needs $180,000 worth of asbestos abatement, and the committee learned more about the general “disarray” at the hearing.
In response, Sen. Bob Phalen, R-Lindsay, had a question of his own to state officials.
“So how much would you take for it?” Phalen asked.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Montana-Gov-Mansion-postcard-1024x632.jpg,,,2025-04-28 21:01:04.682043

This voting location is one of the most popular in the county. (Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Seattle voters will be asked in August if they want to continue paying for the city’s democracy voucher program — a first-of-its-kind public campaign-financing system that gives voters money to donate to political candidates.
Seattle voters created the program in 2015, along with a 10-year property tax levy to fund it. The voucher program aims to make election financing more diverse and equitable by giving voters four $25 coupons they can give to city of Seattle candidates during elections.
Ten years after it was created, city officials say the program has been a success. On Monday, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to send a property tax levy renewal to the August ballot that would fund the program for another decade.
If passed, the levy would cost the median homeowner about $13 a year and raise about $45 million over 10 years. The figure is about $15 million higher than the expiring levy to account for inflation and increased candidate participation in the program.
City Council members praised the program across the board, with several saying they’d seen the positive impact firsthand during their own runs for office.
“For me, this specifically meant that I didn’t need to take campaign donations that I felt might have implicit strings attached,” said Councilmember Dan Strauss. “This allowed me to be more independent, and it meant that I actively chose to knock on everyday Seattleites’ doors rather than spending time on the phone, calling political donors.”
Many Councilmembers said the program is especially important in light of threats to democracy at the national level and the growing influence of wealth in politics.
“Our democracy is at risk,” said Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck. “We must take every step here in Seattle to protect it, because in a healthy democracy, billionaires can’t buy elections.”
Most democracy vouchers go unused. A study by researchers at Stony Brook and Georgetown University found that participation among the voting-age population declined from 7.59% in the 2021 election to 4.72% in 2023.
City Council member Cathy Moore noted that there remains a need to educate people about the program, particularly in communities where English is not the primary language.
Candidates in the races for Seattle mayor, city attorney and three Council seats are eligible for democracy vouchers this year.

State Climatologist Justin Glisan said Iowa had “an unseasonably wet reporting period” with the average precipitation for the week above 2 inches and more than 5 inches in some areas of the state. 
The precipitation raised soil moisture conditions, making topsoil conditions 86% adequate or wetter. Subsoil conditions rated 67% adequate moisture.

Thirty-four percent of Iowa’s corn acres and 25% of soybean acres are in the ground, which is up from 18% and 11% respectively from last week. Northwest Iowa has the highest percentages of crops in the group. 
Temperatures for the reporting period of April 21 through April 27 averaged in the mid 50s, which is 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit higher than normal.

Iowa oat farmers are almost finished seeding as more than 80% of oat acres have been planted, though only 41% of anticipated oat acres have emerged, which is three days behind the year prior.
Pastures in Iowa rated 91% fair or better and according to the report, some cow calf pairs across the state were put on pasture.  
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the upcoming warm temperatures and potential break in rain events should “give farmers a window to get in the field.” The secretary also noted the Monday night forecast, which shows a potential for severe weather in the state. 
“This is a good reminder to Iowans to be vigilant, have safety plans in place and be ready to take shelter if needed,” Naig said in a statement.

State Sens. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue and Ben Hansen of Blair plan to host the series this Saturday in La Vista, Sunday in Omaha and Monday in Lincoln. Attendants will be able to hear updates on the status of medical cannabis legislation, namely Hansen’s Legislative Bill 677, and “share their thoughts.”

Sunday, May 4, from 1-3 p.m., at the University of Nebraska at Omaha Thompson Alumni Center (8800 Dodge St., Omaha).
Monday, May 5, from 5-7 p.m., at Southeast Community College (8800 O St., Lincoln).

In November, about 71% of Nebraskans legalized medical cannabis with a physician’s recommendation, and 67% of Nebraskans voted for a regulatory scheme.
“Since the legislature has failed to act at this point, I want to give the citizens an opportunity to have their voices heard by their elected representatives,” Cavanaugh told the Nebraska Examiner.
General Affairs Committee
Hansen’s LB 677 seeks to help the ballot measures build better guardrails, with help from supporters who put the measures on the ballot.
His bill would delay full implementation of the regulatory law to give the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission time to craft regulations that, without funding, officials have said is near impossible to get done by the voter-set July 1 deadline or begin licensing by Oct. 1.
LB 677 has stalled in the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee that Holdcroft chairs. Cavanaugh is the vice chair.
Holdcroft, who has said he would support a narrowed LB 677, said he is looking for “back and forth” at the public forums, such as whether to allow smoking or how many dispensaries should be permitted.
At an April 17 meeting of committee members, the committee considered a narrower committee amendment that sought to create a list of qualifying conditions, restrict who can recommend medical cannabis, exclude smoking as permissible for medical cannabis and prohibit sales of natural cannabis flower or bud.
None of the eight committee members tried to attach the amendment to LB 677. Advancing the bill as-is failed along ideological lines, 3-5.

Five days later, Hansen filed an amendment to add post-traumatic stress disorder as a qualifying condition and allow sales of flower and bud, the latter of which is a line in the sand for Hansen. Hansen also filed what is known as a “pull motion” that would advance LB 677, with at least 25 votes in the full 49-member legislative body and start the three-round debate.
The latest Hansen amendment would not allow smoking.
Holdcroft and Hansen continue to discuss whether a path forward in the committee exists. Speaker John Arch of La Vista, who sets the daily legislative agenda, declined to say if he would schedule the pull motion as those discussions continue.
‘Uphold the voice of the people’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, said her team is “very appreciative” of lawmakers’ efforts to give voters a chance to voice their feelings on the issue.
“While we find it disheartening that Nebraskans are being asked to ‘clarify their vote,’ we hope this final effort makes it clear: Nebraskans support medical cannabis. They knew what they were voting for,” Eggers said. “They now are demanding lawmakers to uphold the voice of the people.”
LB 677 faces a tight timeline and fiscal situation in the waning days of the 2025 legislative session. Debate on the state’s budget bills — with a major hole to still fill — is set to begin May 6. The final budget must pass by May 15.
Lawmakers are set to adjourn for the year on June 9.
Also co-hosting the public forums are State Sens. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, John Fredrickson of Omaha, Jane Raybould of Lincoln, Victor Rountree of Bellevue, Margo Juarez of Omaha, Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, Megan Hunt of Omaha, Myron Dorn of Adams, Merv Riepe of Ralston, Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, Tom Brandt of Plymouth, George Dungan of Lincoln and Danielle Conrad of Lincoln.

 | ScreenshotWith Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan opting against seeking a fourth term in pursuit of the governor’s seat, Detroit is in need of a new mayor. On Saturday  seven hopeful candidates met at Riverside Marina to introduce themselves and make their case for why they were the best qualified to lead the city. 
Former nonprofit CEO Saunteel Jenkins, attorney Todd Perkins, former police Chief James Craig, businessmen Joel Haashiim, City Councilmember Fred Durhal III, entrepreneur Jonathan Barlow and City Council President Mary Sheffield each took time to flex their qualifications while taking questions on how they would work to support the city’s residents and address its most pressing issues, alongside their plans to maintain vital programs when the state’s American Rescue Plan Act funding expires at the end of 2026. 
Triumph Church Pastor Rev. Solomon Kinloch, Jr. and two-time mayoral candidate Danetta Simpson have also filed to run in the Aug. 5 mayoral primary, though the two were not present at Saturday’s forum.
During the forum candidates were asked to name the city’s biggest problem and what they would do to address it, with candidates pointing to economic opportunity, housing, public safety and empowering residents through education and opportunities within Detroit neighborhoods as the issues at the top of their mind. 
Several candidates also called attention to the need for affordable childcare, following a question on how they would uplift women of color within the city.
“When we talk about some of the issues that our women face, particularly here in the city of Detroit, I will tell you, as a father who drops his son off at daycare, childcare is too expensive,” Durhal said. 
“Paying $2,000 a month to have childcare for your children is crazy. And so imagine if you are a single parent, mother or father, and you have to go to work, you have to take your child to daycare. You have to rush there. You gotta get there before six o’clock and they charge you a premium if you don’t. This is reality,” Durhal said. 
The candidates were also asked how they’d maintain programs, services and jobs created using more than $800 million in COVID-19 relief funds which are set to run out at the end of 2026.

Jenkins said the next mayor will need to dig into the numbers to make sure the city has enough revenues, alongside working with the state and the federal government — “whether they like it or not.”
Perkins called for a full scale audit of the city, as did Craig and Haashim. 
However, Perkins said he wasn’t afraid to take Lansing or the White House to court to ensure the city receives any funding it is due. 
“Whether it be the United States America versus or Perkins Law Group versus, I’ve been on one side of that ‘v’, and I’m not afraid of confrontation because out of confrontation and discord, we get understanding,” Perkins said.
Craig said he would leverage his ties to the White House, with Craig previously drawing praise from President Donald Trump for his leadership amid Black Lives Matter protests in Summer of 2020.
The city later agreed to a $1 million settlement after protestors filed federal lawsuits arguing the Detroit Police Department used unconstitutional and excessive force and prevented the protestors from exercising their First Amendment rights. 
“This is about the city of Detroit. It has nothing to do with the person sitting in the White House or James Craig. It has everything to do with the city of Detroit,” Craig said. 
Amid talk of forensic audits of the city’s budget, Durhal encouraged his fellow candidates to watch him chair the city’s Budget, Finance and Audit Standing Committee, where they will review audits from the auditor general. 
The council has already begun taking steps to convert jobs added through federal funding into permanent positions, Durhal said, but the next mayor will also need to be brave enough to tell people that they must remain fiscally prudent.
Sheffield noted that under her leadership the city had passed 12 balanced budgets, and that she would work with private and philanthropic support to see how the city could continue some of its grant programs.
“Our day one intention is to join a coalition with our local hospitals — because there’s a correlation between health and housing — to create a pot of money that can continue funding home repair grants here in the city of Detroit,” Sheffield said. 
She also said the city needed to diversify its revenues including working with  the federal government and bipartisan leadership in Lansing. 
Barlow touted his business connections and relationships with political leaders like Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens.
“No one behind me can tell you where they sit at on the yachts down in Mar a Lago or down in Miami. I’m the only one who’s taking a yacht from this marina all the way down to Miami. That’s because we play at a different level when we don’t get involved in petty popularity politics at the local level,” Barlow said, later arguing the city could better assess its assets.
Detroit residents will vote in the nonpartisan primary election on Aug. 5, and the candidates with the two highest vote totals will face off once more in the Nov. 4 general election.

(West Virginia Legislative Photography)Gov. Patrick Morrisey has signed dozens of Republican-backed bills into law, including measures officially eliminating the state’s Office of Equal Opportunity and rolling back work permit requirements for some teenagers. 
The bills were among 73 measures signed by Morrisey April 25 ahead of the governor’s bill signing deadline by the end of the day Wednesday.
In total, the governor has signed 161 bills, and on Monday, Morrisey said in a post on social media platform X that another 48 bills will be signed and shared in the coming days. 
“The final 40 bills are under close review, as we continue to research them and see whether there are adequate arguments to approve these bills to determine whether they should become law,” Morrisey wrote. 
“For the future, folks should know that if your bill costs taxpayers money and you haven’t provided an offset (a saver) for your proposed program, the odds of your initiative getting approved will be slim,” he continued. 

UPDATE: After many days of reviewing bills, we are near the end of the review process.

Office of Equal Opportunity officially eliminated 
Morrisey approved Senate Bill 837, sponsored by Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, that will formally eliminate the state’s Office of Equal Opportunity by repealing its mandate in state code. The office was tasked with complying with federal disability rights and investigated discrimination and harassment claims from public employees.
While vetting the bills, members of the House of Delegates learned that the OEO seemed to already be gone without lawmakers’ required approval. The office doesn’t have any employees or a website. 
Lawmakers opted to keep the office’s director position within the Division of Personnel, though the position is currently vacant. Rucker said the bill was an effort to streamline state government since the OEO’s work was already being done by the Division of Personnel. 
Morrisey also signed another measure sponsored by Rucker that will terminate the “Employee Suggestion Award Board” by terminating five sections of code, including a program that provides cash or honorary awards to state employees whose adopted suggestions result in substantial savings or improvement in state operations.
“We heard that this is not really helping the state. We were very hopeful when this got passed years ago that employees would be able to give us ideas that would really significantly find waste and we could reduce cost to the state. But that is not what has happened,” Rucker said during bill debate March 20 in the Senate. “Unfortunately, It has been years since there’s been a single suggestion.”
Rucker said they encouraged state agencies to still accept suggestions from employees regarding cost savings. 
New law rolls back teen work permit requirement  
The governor signed Senate Bill 427 that will roll back work permit requirements for 14- and 15-year olds in West Virginia. The bill is sponsored by Sen. Rupie Phillips, R-Logan. 
Current state law requires 14- and 15-year-olds who want to work to get a permit from their school superintendent; the new law, which goes into effect in July, no longer requires that permit. 
Employers seeking to hire the teenagers will still be required to obtain an age certificate verifying the child’s age from the state Division of Labor and the written consent of the child’s parent or guardian. 
The age certificate would include the child’s age, name and date of birth, as well as information about the job they’re seeking, among other things.
Controversial DEI bill not yet signed 
The governor still hasn’t signed off on a number of high-profile Republican-backed measures from this year’s legislative session, including a bill tightening the state’s already-strict ban on gender-affirming care for minors and a measure requiring school employees to alert parents when a child requests to be referred to by a different name or pronouns that are different from the student’s biological sex.
While Morrisey issued an executive order eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs in state government, he hasn’t yet signed a bill that would codify that order. The measure is facing a potential legal challenge after the Senate’s Democratic members said the bill was not legally passed on the final night of session because of a “series of procedural irregularities.”

Greg Gianforte signs House Bill 337 into law, giving Montanans a $756 million income tax cut over the next four years. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Surrounded by three dozen Republican lawmakers on the steps of the Montana capitol, Gov. Greg Gianforte on Monday signed into law a bill cutting income taxes — the third reduction over the five years of his administration. 
House Bill 337, sponsored by House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage, lowers Montana’s top tax rate by .5% over two years, expands the eligibility threshold for filers to pay the state’s lower tax rate, and doubles the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
“Once again this legislative session, we’re putting money back in Montanan’s pockets through permanent, long term tax reductions, and we couldn’t have done it without the legislators that are here with me today,” Gianforte said before affixing his signature to the new law. 
Calling it the “largest tax cut in Montana’s history,” Gianforte said decreasing the top tax rate was a step closer to his goal of having a single, flat rate in the state, which he said will make the state more friendly to businesses and individuals. 
“We still have the highest income tax rate in the region and one of the highest in the nation. It’s a drag on our economy, a wet blanket on job creation and a burden on Montana families,” Gianforte said. 
While the governor focused most of his remarks on the reduction of the top tax rate from 5.9% to 5.4% over the next biennium, Ler remarked that the bill’s “real power comes from how we’ve restructured the entire system.”
The threshold where Montana filers move between the state’s two income brackets is substantially raised under the new law — essentially tripling the income individuals and joint filers can earn before paying a higher rate. The law also doubles the state’s earned income credit, which targets the state’s lowest earners. 
“This is reform that reaches everyone,” Ler said. “We didn’t get here overnight. This bill is a result of careful policy work and a clear vision that is a shared belief that Montanans deserve a tax code that works for them, not against them.”

The three changes made to the state’s tax structure will reduce the revenue flowing to the state’s general fund by roughly $756 million by fiscal year 2029, according to a fiscal analysis of the legislation, which was a major sticking point for detractors. 
Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, said the bill was “well meaning, but it’s just too expensive,” during debate on the Senate floor. Fern brought his own income tax bill aimed at lower and middle class earners that carried a lower fiscal note but didn’t make it through the House.
The bill passed both chambers with all Democrats in opposition on their initial votes, and just two Democrats voting for the bill overall. 
“Government does not exist to give tax cuts to people who do not need them. Government exists to fund schools, fix roads, and provide public safety. Democrats do not support robbing people of essential services to pay for tax cuts for people who absolutely do not need them,” House Appropriations Committee Vice Chairperson Rep. Mary Caferro, D-Helena, said in a press release. “The public is not crying out for more tax cuts for people at the top.”
Gianforte proposed an even larger tax break in his budget last November, which would have cut the top tax rate by a full percentage point without adjusting the lower rate threshold. The new law emerged as a compromise between the governor’s plan and one championed by the conservative wing of the senate. 
“I’ve heard loud and clear from Montanans in every corner of our state, income tax relief is a top priority, and I’m incredibly proud of each person up here for helping deliver that needed relief,” Gianforte said. 
The Legislature wrapped up its 83rd day in Helena on Monday, and is expected to adjourn later this week after the final details are hammered out on a package of property tax relief proposals.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gov_income_signing-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-04-28 20:06:06.666158

(Photo via Getty Images)Iowa schools would have to show ultrasound videos and computer-generated graphics on fetal development in Iowa classrooms under legislation sent to the governor’s desk Monday.
Senate File 175, approved 33-16, would require human growth and development classes for Iowa students in grades 5-12 include ultrasound video and computer-generated rendering or animations depicting “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization.”
 This measure was modeled after laws in other states and similar bills brought up in previous sessions that referenced the “Meet Baby Olivia” video created by anti-abortion group Live Action, though the 2025 legislation does not mention the video by name.
The bill was amended by the House April 17 to ban materials on fetal development from being shown in classrooms if the entity that created it performs or “promotes” abortions, or if it contracts, affiliates, or makes referrals to organizations that perform or promote abortions.
Democrat in both chambers said this amendment would lead to inaccurate and biased material being shown in Iowa classrooms, as most of the medical organizations that work on issues related to pregnancy and fetal development perform or provide referrals for abortions when medically necessary. The measure only refers to “abortion” at large, and does not exclude entities that only perform medically necessary abortions, such as in cases when the pregnancy puts the life of the mother at risk.
The Mayo Clinic, a Minnesota-based health care provider, was brought up as an organization that would be excluded from school material under the bill despite being a leading professional source on fetal development.
Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, also argued that material from the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics would be excluded, as the UI hospital system performs abortions to save the life of the pregnant person. Wahls also said material developed by other UI entities like the proposed “center for intellectual freedom” would also be excluded, as it is “affiliated” with UIHC.
“I think it’s very clear that by being an affiliate of an entity that performs abortions — and that is something that happens at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics — research, human-based, age-appropriate curriculum that was being developed at the University of Iowa, is no longer going to be acceptable in Iowa classrooms,” Wahls said. “That is just very peculiar.”
Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, said he preferred the Senate version and felt the House amendment was “probably unnecessary given the parameters of the original bill” — arguing that entities performing abortions would already be excluded from creating school materials under the original legislation, as the material is required to depict “the humanity of the unborn child.”
“Entities that perform or promote abortions are liable to be biased against the humanity and inherent value of human life before birth, which is one of the central components of this bill,” Taylor said. “That is not to say that everything they produce is false, but in order to be unbiased, it doesn’t make sense to use prenatal development information from abortion advocates.”
He said opponents were ignoring the language in the bill requiring the information shown in school classrooms be medically accurate and research-based. However, he said this material could show a “biased” view if they perform abortions or support access to abortions, pointing to guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to use the term “embryo” instead of “baby” or “unborn child” when discussing early stages of gestation.
“Embryo is an accurate scientific term to refer to a specific point in the human development process, but it is important to not leave out that this is a stage of human development,” Taylor said. “Using material from abortion advocates may provide a tainted view of human life before birth, and that is unfair to young learning minds. Embryos, fetuses, babies, adolescents and adults are all human, and that fact should not be hidden — that every life, no matter how small, contains humanity and dignity from the very start.”

,DC,2025-04-28 23:34:06+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump orders list of ‘sanctuary cities’ to target for funding freeze,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-orders-list-sanctuary-cities-target-funding-freeze,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday evening signed executive orders targeting so-called sanctuary cities by threatening to revoke federal funding and providing legal services and national security assets to law enforcement.The signings fell on the eve of Trump’s first 100 days of his second term, during which his administration has enacted an immigration crackdown that has led to clashes with the judiciary branch and cities that do not coordinate with federal immigration authorities, often referred to as “sanctuary cities.""“Some State and local officials nevertheless continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws,” according to the executive order regarding sanctuary cities. “This is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government's obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States.”The order directs the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to publicly list local jurisdictions that limit cooperation with immigration officials, but do not stop immigration enforcement.Jurisdictions on the list will then be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget to “identify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as appropriate.”This is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The Justice Department recently filed a lawsuit against the city of Rochester, New York, over its immigration policies after local law enforcement did not assist federal immigration officials in an arrest. The Trump administration argued those ordinances in Rochester were impeding federal immigration enforcement.The president also signed an executive order in January that threatened to withhold federal funding from states and local governments that refused to aid in federal immigration enforcement activities. A federal judge in San Francisco last week blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from 16 so-called sanctuary cities.Republicans have also scrutinized those policies, including during a six-hour hearing of the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that included grilling mayors from Boston, Chicago and Denver, on their cities’ immigration policies. The executive order also aims to curb any federal benefits that may extend to people without permanent legal status.That executive order directed DOJ and DHS to “take appropriate action to stop the enforcement of State and local laws” that allow for students without proper legal authorization to receive in-state tuition, which would include those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.Last week, administration officials cheered the FBI arrest of a Wisconsin judge who they say helped an immigrant in the country without legal authorization escape detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The arrest followed the third appearance by ICE officers seeking to make arrests at the Milwaukee County Courthouse, a practice some experts believe hinders local law enforcement.Law enforcement resourcesA second executive order Trump signed Monday provides legal resources for law enforcement officials “who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law.”The order also directs coordination among the departments of Justice, Defense and Homeland Security to “increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement.” Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the executive order relating to law enforcement will “strengthen and unleash America’s law enforcement to pursue criminals and protect innocent citizens.”",,,,2025-04-28 20:06:06.666158

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A retired teacher is the governor’s choice to fill a long-vacant seat on the Oklahoma State Board of Education.
Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Monday he chose Becky Carson for the board position representing Congressional District 5 to a term expiring April 2, 2027. The seat has been empty for almost two years since former board member Trent Smith resigned.
Carson, of Edmond, was a special education teacher for 30 years, serving students in third through fifth grade with mild disabilities.
She also has owned multiple businesses, according to the governor’s announcement.
“I am honored to serve on the state Board of Education,” Carson said in a statement. “Throughout my career, I’ve always believed that every child deserves a chance to reach their full potential. I am committed, dependable and ready to help ensure every Oklahoma student has the opportunity to succeed.”
Her appointment to the board hinges on whether the state Senate confirms her.

She would be the third former educator among the sitting members, following state Superintendent Ryan Walters, who taught history at McAlester and Millwood high schools, and Mike Tinney, who taught history in the small Oklahoma town of Chattanooga before becoming an attorney.
“Her commitment to doing what’s best for students and her proven leadership will make her an outstanding addition to the state Board of Education,” Stitt said.
The governor tried to appoint former Trump administration official Alex Gray to the role last year, but Gray’s home senator responsible for carrying his nomination, Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City, declined to do so, calling him unqualified for the position. Without her support, his nomination never came up for a Senate confirmation vote and therefore failed.
It wasn’t immediately clear which of four possible senators would have to carry Carson’s nomination. Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond; Sen. Kristen Thompson, R-Edmond; Sen. Kelly Hines, R-Edmond, and Sen. Grant Green, R-Wellston, each have Edmond addresses within their districts.
Pugh said the Senate Education Committee, which he leads, and the full Senate have until the end of this year’s legislative session to consider Carson’s confirmation.
“We’ll meet with her privately so the committee has time to get to know her and ask some questions,” Pugh said.

Three other recent appointees to the board — Tinney, Chris Van Denhende and Ryan Deatherage — have taken office but also are waiting for Senate confirmation.
The senators representing Tinney and Deatherage’s home districts — Sen. Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, and Sen. Darcy Jech, R-Kingfisher, respectively — did not immediately return requests for comment on whether they intend to support the appointees’ confirmations.
Sen. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa, is the home senator for Van Denhende. She said her concerns with newly proposed academic standards for social studies have weighed heavily on her decision.
Van Denhende voted in favor of the social studies standards, but he later said he was unaware of controversial last-minute changes made to the final draft before he took the vote. Tinney and Deatherage also said they had no idea of the changes, which included language stating there were “discrepancies” in 2020 election results.
Van Denhende said during Thursday’s board meeting that if he knew then what he knows now, he would have voted against the standards. He told The Oklahoman he wants the Legislature to send the standards back to the board for another review.
“The process is not a good process,” Van Denhende said during Thursday’s meeting.
House and Senate Democrats filed resolutions on March 31 to reject the social studies standards and return them to the board. The Senate GOP caucus is now deliberating a similar resolution.
Goodwin said she and Van Denhende agree on the issue.
“We are in agreement that there was a failure in the standards process and the matter should be returned to the board,” Goodwin said. “Based on (his) recommendation that the matter be returned to the board, I would support his nomination.”

(LDEQ)The top financial officer for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has left the agency, marking the latest in a string of high-level departures under Secretary Aurelia Giacometto.
Theresa Delafosse, the lead administrator at LDEQ’s Financial Services Division, has transferred out of the agency after nine years on the job. The State Civil Service Commission confirmed her transfer but did not yet have any details about her new assignment. 
Delafosse could not be reached for comment Monday. 
A licensed attorney and certified public accountant, Delafosse was the highest ranking fiscal employee at LDEQ and the lone remaining executive in the agency’s Office of Management and Finance. 
Former Undersecretary Christian Griffiths was in charge of that office until he transferred from the agency in September after just a few months on the job. 
Delafosse previously worked at the state Department of Revenue and the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s Office. Her departure comes about a month after Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack published the results of a workplace culture survey that indicated pervasive low morale under Giacometto’s leadership with some employees reporting feeling pressured to violate the law or department policy. 
LDEQ employees slam Aurelia Giacometto’s leadership in workplace culture survey

Her exit also comes roughly two weeks after the abrupt resignation of long-time LDEQ ombudsman Roger Ward, who disseminated a scathing seven-page letter detailing what he called “the increasingly erratic and alarmingly vicious behavior” of Giacometto. Ward said he wrote the letter in lieu of providing an exit interview, a long-established LDEQ practice Giacometto ended recently. 
Ward’s missive reinforces a similar departing letter former LDEQ Undersecretary Chandra Pidgeon wrote in March 2024 after a few short weeks of being hired. Pigeon similarly complained about Giacometto’s “harassment of longtime employees” and other actions.
“I have worked for 23 years for the state of Louisiana, and I have never encountered a leader so destructive, calculating, and callous,” she wrote.
LDEQ’s communications division did not respond to a request for comment for this report Monday afternoon.
LDEQ executives and key employees that have left the agency under Giacometto’s tenure include, among others:

Chandra Pigeon, undersecretary
Stacey Holley, chief of staff
Justin Crossie, chief of staff
Meagan Molter, communications director
Christian Griffiths, undersecretary
Jordan Deshotels, undersecretary
Jared Champagne, training and development program manager

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch )The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted an emergency waiver permitting the nationwide sale of a fuel blend with higher amounts of ethanol through the summer months, which fuel and farm leaders say will help farmers, fuel producers and drivers at the pumps.
Midwestern states, including Iowa and South Dakota, already had waivers in place to allow for summer sales of fuel blended with 15% ethanol, also known as E15. EPA’s decision Monday waives the agency’s summer restrictions on the fuel for the rest of the country and follows guidance from the president’s executive order from January, declaring a national energy emergency.
The press release from EPA said the move will “provide families with relief” by providing more options at the pump with lower prices per gallon.
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, said Monday on social media that the decision “supports our producers, gives consumers more options at the pump, and bolsters our energy security.” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, also praised the move on social media, calling it “a positive step for South Dakota farmers and consumers.”

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig applauded the decision and said Iowa drivers saved more than $38 million by choosing E15 over E10, a lower blend of ethanol fuel, in 2024.
“Today’s E15 announcement by the Trump Administration is a win for consumers across the U.S. and farmers here in Iowa,” Naig said in a statement. “This decision is a big step toward making our country more energy dominant, independent, and secure.”
Iowa Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley both applauded the measure, noting it was an example of “promises made, promises kept” by the president and would be a “big” boost for corn farmers.
“It’s clear (President Trump) is making our farmers, producers, and all of rural America a priority, and I look forward to working alongside him to secure permanent, nationwide access to this cleaner, cheaper choice at the pump,” Ernst said in a statement.
According to National Corn Growers Association, year-round E15 sales throughout the country would lead to an increased demand of more than 2 billion bushels of corn annually, which is why the group has pushed for increased ethanol demand.
Brent Johnson, president of Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, applauded the EPA decision, but noted EPA has consistently issued similar waivers, and urged for a permanent change to the rule.
“Clearly, there is strong consumer demand for a lower-cost fuel option at the pump, and Iowa farmers stand by readily able to meet the growing demand for biofuels,” Johnson said in a statement.
Naig similarly noted the need for a permanent regulation allowing the sale of the fuel. He, along with Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and industry groups have all sent letters to congressional leaders urging the passage of such a law.
“We are tired of waiting,” Monte Shaw, executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement. “Consumers and retailers are tired of waiting. E15 could provide a market for 5 to 7 billion gallons of additional ethanol demand at a time when American farmers and rural communities are hurting.”
The EPA waiver is in place from May 1 through May 20, as the Clean Air Act only allows a 20-day waiver, but considering trends from the past several summers, industry leaders expect the waiver will be extended through the other summer months.

Melissa Schmidt, a Republican from Eldridge (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Missouri lawmakers are playing tax cut tennis, and on Monday the state House served its latest offering when it narrowed the differences with the state Senate in a bill that helps wealthy taxpayers and some who are at the bottom of the income scale.
The proposal is the smallest, in terms of revenue reductions, of several bills intended to cut taxes this year. It exempts long-term capital gains — profits on investments or property held for more than a year — from state income tax.
It also boosts the income limits and credit amounts for the refundable tax credit known as the circuit breaker, which helps defer the cost of property taxes for low-income seniors and people with disabilities.
Those provisions mirror the language in a bill that has already passed the Senate but has not received a final House vote. One key difference is that the Senate-passed version would adjust the circuit breaker credit amounts for inflation starting in 2027, while the bill approved Monday does not.
It also does not include the sales tax exemption for diapers and feminine hygiene products included in the Senate-passed bill.
House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins, a Republican from Bowling Green, said the latest plan was intended to send the Senate something it could accept.
“We feel like the Senate will be able to pass our language on this as is,” Perkins said.
The bill began as a proposal to allow the Department of Revenue to forgive interest and penalties when it has to prorate tax credits because claims exceed the annual allowance. For the past three years, people claiming Missouri’s food pantry tax credit found they didn’t get the full value when the state Department of Revenue reviewed their returns.
The bill passed by a 92-58 vote, with 11 Republicans voting against it along with all Democrats. The bill needs only a final Senate vote to send it to Gov. Mike Kehoe.
During debate, Democrats warned that big tax cuts now are a mistake because of uncertainty, both in future support from federal funding and the possibility of an economic recession due to tariff and other policy shifts under President Donald Trump.
“Wait for another year. Let’s see what happens with the U.S. economy before we cut another tax,” said state Rep. Steve Butz, a Democrat fromSt. Louis. “We need to go slow, because you can’t reverse this decision.”
The tax limitations in the Missouri Constitution would require a statewide vote if, in a year or two, lawmakers decided they had cut taxes too much.
The fiscal note for the bill, which gives the official estimate of whether it will increase or decrease state revenue, states that exempting capital gains would reduce revenue from the individual income tax by about $110 million annually, with another $180 million reduction with the corporate cut kicks in.
Outside observers question that estimate, with the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimating that the revenue reduction could be $600 million or more.
Since 2014, when lawmakers enacted a tax cut over the veto of then-Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, Missouri’s top income tax rate has fallen from 6% to 4.7%. Two future tax cuts, to a 4.5% rate, are already in state law and will take effect if general revenue growth hits targets.
The changes in the circuit breaker credit would reduce state revenue by about $75 million annually. 
People 65 and older and those with a qualifying disability are eligible for a credit against property taxes on their residence. Since 2008 the maximum credit for homeowners has been $1,100, while for people who rent their home the maximum credit is $750.
The legislation would increase the credit for homeowners to $1,550 and for renters to $1,055.
The proposal would also increase the maximum income for claiming the credit from $27,500 for single taxpayers who rent to $38,200 and for single taxpayers who own their home from $30,000 to $42,200. For married couples, the limit would be $41,000 for renters and $48,000 for homeowners.
Most of the debate Monday focused on whether the circuit breaker changes were enough to balance the benefits being provided to wealthy taxpayers.
“This is an amendment that our senior citizens need for us to do, as it truly helps those in the lowest income brackets,” said state Rep. Mark Matthiesen, a Republican from O’Fallon. “Also those with disabilities need our help.”
Democrats said the circuit breaker changes were designed to mask the problems that would be created by additional large income tax cuts.
“It’s the arsonist,” said Rep. Mark Boyko, a Democrat from Kirkwood, “telling us that they’ll give us 10 seconds to go rescue the grandfather clock.”

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)An out-of-state group that sued the commonwealth for records it claimed would show “non-U.S. citizens have been registering and voting in Pennsylvania for decades” lost an appeal in federal court.
The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Virginia-based Public Integrity Law Foundation has no standing to sue the Pennsylvania Department of State for voter registration records under a federal law intended to increase participation in elections.
“While a statute may authorize private suits to compel compliance with the law, private citizens are not deputized as private attorneys general empowered to enforce any and all violations of a statute without regard to their personal stake in the matter,” Circuit Judge Marjorie O. Rendell wrote in an opinion for the court.
A spokesperson said the Department of State is pleased with the decision. A PILF spokesperson said it is considering the court’s opinion and “will be moving forward from there.”
PILF sued the department in 2017 after then-Philadelphia Election Commissioner Al Schmidt said a glitch in Pennsylvania’s electronic driver’s licensing system could allow noncitizens to register to vote, citing 168 such instances in the city. Schmidt is now secretary of the commonwealth.
The Department of State confirmed that it was working to fix the problem but was not aware of the issue before Schmidt alerted them, the Associated Press reported at the time.
The lawsuit claimed the department was required to provide records under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), commonly known as the Motor Voter Law that, among other voting access provisions, required states to provide an opportunity to register to vote when applying for a driver’s license and other state services. 
A U.S. District Court judge ultimately ruled partly in favor of PILF and ordered the Department of State to pay attorney fees and costs to the organization. Both PILF and the department of state appealed.
The 3rd Circuit decision noted while the act provides for public inspection of records concerning programs to ensure the accuracy of voter rolls and remedial right to sue, a recent U.S. Supreme Court case raised the bar for a plaintiff in such a suit to show they have actually been harmed.
In support of its claim of injury and standing to sue under the NVRA, PILF argued that without the records, it could not analyze the department’s activities to maintain voter lists and was unable to carry out its mission of promoting what it calls election integrity and compliance with state and federal election laws.
The organization also claimed the denial hampered its production and dissemination of educational materials and that it had expended considerable time and money seeking the records. 
The 3rd Circuit said there is not a sufficient connection between the consequences PILF identified and Congress’ goals in enacting the NVRA. As an out-of-state public interest law firm that failed to show evidence of concrete harm caused by the secretary of the commonwealth’s refusal to provide the records it requested, PILF has no standing to sue, Rendell wrote.  
“PILF does not represent any Pennsylvania citizens who have been affected by the Secretary’s purported violation of the NVRA,” Rendell’s opinion says. “It has no direct ties to Pennsylvania voters and has not alleged how access to the records it seeks would ‘directly lead to action’ or that its ‘direct participation in the electoral process [has been] hindered.’”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7425-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-28 20:06:06.666158

(Courtesy of Alora Casper, Executive Director of United Utah Party)Two of Utah’s centrist parties have officially joined forces in hopes of growing a movement to break away from a two-party, “us-versus-them” system.
The United Utah Party and the Utah Forward Party held an unprecedented combined convention on Saturday at Salt Lake Community College in Taylorsville, where both parties voted nearly unanimously to approve a memorandum of understanding to formally merge under the umbrella of the national Forward Party.
An ‘unprecedented’ merger of 2 centrist parties: United Utah Party looks to join Forward Party

It’s the first time two political parties have ever joined together in the state of Utah. Party officials said they’re coordinating with the state’s top election officials in the lieutenant governor’s office to facilitate the merger, for which no legal process exists in state law. 
Still, the parties are charting their own path for the merger, for which the now-approved memorandum of understanding lays out a process that will take place over the next several months. 
The new party’s name, the MOU stipulates, “shall be the ‘Utah Forward Party,’ the ‘United Forward Party’ or such other name selected and approved by the National Forward Party.” 
On Saturday, both parties voted independently to approve the merger before combining in a joint session, where leaders gave speeches applauding the merger as a momentum-building move for Utah’s moderate and centrist movement.

Speakers included newly-elected Chair Michelle Quist — who last year ran as United Utah’s candidate for attorney general — and Sen. Dan Thatcher, a former Republican from West Valley, who recently announced he’d left the GOP to join the Utah Forward Party. 
“There are real problems that Utahns are facing, but our leaders aren’t listening because they’re too busy trying to win their partisan blood sport,” Quist said. “The two-party system has not served us well. … We cannot see beyond the us-versus-them mentality. So it’s time to move beyond that psyche and look to do what’s best for Utahns.” 
Former New Jersey governor and EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman — who co-founded and co-chairs the national Forward Party alongside businessman and onetime presidential candidate Andrew Yang — also spoke Saturday, encouraging Utahns to break the stranglehold of the two-party system, which she said is more focused on winning than representing Americans. 
“I honestly believe that we are within a hair of losing our democracy,” Whitman said. “There is, to me, an unconscionable lack of respect for the rule of law, the lack of respect for the Constitution. … It’s not about solving problems, it’s about staying in power.”

She pointed to states like Utah, where most districts are largely controlled by “one party,” the GOP, resulting in elections where “voters don’t have a choice. There’s one candidate, and that’s it. And that has never served the public.” 
“When all an incumbent has to do is worry about their base in the primaries, they don’t care about the rest of the people. To heck with it, and they don’t represent the rest of the people when they get in,” Whitman said.

Yang also issued a prepared statement in a news release issued by party leaders, pointing to Gallup polling that shows roughly 60% of Americans agree that the U.S. needs a third major party because the Republican and Democratic parties “do such a poor job” of representing Americans. 
“It’s no wonder why,” Yang said. “The existing parties have failed to address the biggest issues facing voters. People want job security and to plan for their retirement; they want their kids to be safe, they want to live in a nation of laws that protect them, they don’t want to be told they need to hate their neighbors if they disagree with them on some policy position. They want their representatives to pay attention to their lives and listen to their needs.”
Instead, Yang said, “the legacy parties are focused on maintaining power and the ‘us versus them’ fight that keeps their fundraising totals high.”
Yang said Utah is at the “forefront” of the Forward Party’s effort to build a “50-state movement.” So far, the Forward Party or an affiliate party is recognized in 13 states, Whitman said, compared to just five states two months ago. Plus, she said the party has 50 elected officeholders who have affiliated in some way with the Forward Party. Their goal, she said, is to be “on the ballot in all states” by the next presidential election, in 2028. 
“We are growing,” she said. “We’re growing fast. We’re growing big.”
Thatcher, when he took the podium, told the crowd of roughly 250 that came to Saturday’s convention that, “you’re not crazy.”

“You’re not imagining it. Things are really, really bad right now,” said the former Republican senator — who in recent years became no stranger to bucking the GOP party line before he unaffiliated last month. “The absolute contempt coming from the (Utah) Legislature this year just completely blew my mind.” 
Thatcher said for years he had been “concerned about the direction” the Republican party was heading, “but I always believed that the GOP would come back to its founding principles.” 
However, when lawmakers tried to amend the Utah Constitution to weaken voters’ ballot initiative powers and give the Legislature the ultimate and final say on all types of ballot initiatives with Amendment D — a ballot question the courts ultimately voided because its language written by GOP legislative leaders was misleading — Thatcher said that “completely made it clear that it’s not going to happen.”

“Because I believe the GOP has ceased to uphold the rule of law, because they are no longer grounded to the Constitution, and because they’re not even following their own platform, which was why I joined them in the first place, they are no longer entitled to my support,” Thatcher said. 
Instead, he said the Forward Party better “respects my principles of rights, of reason, and of respect.” 
“The Forward Party is different from anything I’ve ever seen before,” Thatcher said. “It is why I feel so at home in this place that feels clean. I feel safe in this room. I feel respected in this room. I feel like I can disagree with someone and not have any name-calling or our tables flipping.”
More than anything, Thatcher said he joined the Forward Party because he wants “to fight for people, for decency, for representation.” 
“It is so freeing to stop saying ‘we’ as I talk about the completely crazy things that the (Republican) party is doing to people,” he said. “But moreover, it feels so good to say ‘we’ as I talk about the crazy things the Forward Party is doing for people.

Despite his opinion that the House “watered down” the bill by changing the language and removing the 12-month timeframe for accommodations, Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, said he’d still like to see it passed.
The legislation would require universities to publicize their policies and accommodations for pregnant students and those who recently gave birth, Taylor said, ensuring instructors cannot decide for themselves whether to work with these students and provide support.
“For that reason, I think there continues to be merit to this bill,” Taylor said.
The Senate concurred with the House legislation and passed it with a unanimous vote.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — All three University of Nebraska-Lincoln students whose visas were revoked over the past two weeks have had them restored after the Trump administration backed off its initial efforts to cancel some visas held by international students.
UNL officials confirmed that the third student’s visa was restored Monday, following the restoration of the other two last week. 
Earlier this month, UNL announced that three international students had their visas revoked by the U.S. State Department. UNL has 1,654 international students, according to a university census.
The Justice Department announced the national reversal in federal court last week. The change came after the Trump administration began revoking visas and launching deportation proceedings against a number of students who had participated in demonstrations against Israel during campus protests last year over the war in Gaza, or who had faced criminal charges while a visiting student, including driving under the influence. 
It is unclear why the UNL students’ visas were revoked. The university hasn’t said.
A Justice Department lawyer, Joseph F. Carilli, said immigration officials have begun developing a new system for reviewing and terminating visas for international students. Until the process is complete, Carilli said, agencies would not make additional changes or pursue additional revocations, according to The New York Times.

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA 43-year-old Barre woman was charged Monday with involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of a 45-year-old Barre man last week. The Vermont State Police arrested Donna Robinson last week for allegedly shooting Franklin Driscoll at a home on 879 N. Main Street in Barre on Thursday around 5:25 p.m., the state police said in a press release. Robinson pleaded not guilty to the charges against her and is being held without bail at the Chittenden County Correctional Facility. Driscoll was admitted to Central Vermont Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the abdomen and died early Friday morning, the release said. The state police said the death appeared to be an “isolated event” between people who knew each other, so it did not pose a threat to the general Barre community. Initial witness interviews indicated that Robinson was taking the gun from Driscoll during an altercation with a different person when it went off accidentally, according to the state police affidavit. Robinson was arraigned in Washington County Superior Court Monday afternoon for involuntary manslaughter, along with charges of five counts of reckless endangerment, one count of simple assault and two counts of possession of a firearm while having a felony conviction. Robinson was convicted for selling heroin in 2017 and for a stolen-property-related crime in 2012. She appeared at the hearing virtually from the women’s prison in South Burlington.Justice Michael Harris denied the state’s request to also charge Robinson with burglary. At the arraignment, he said there was no evidence that Robinson had not received permission to be on the property, where at least six other people were apparently present at the time of the incident. Harris, defense attorney Michael Shane and prosecutor Talon Wendel discussed the nature of the evidence for each charge, which was primarily witness testimony from people at the house during the time of the shooting. Shane said the case was “thin” and that Robinson had every intention of fighting it, noting that key charges appeared to rely on the statement of a single witness. Wendel argued that the evidence was bolstered by statements from several other witnesses, who provided corroborating testimony although they had not personally seen the actual shooting. Harris said, “I think there’s going to be a lot more the state’s going to have to show as to how it occurred,” but that the evidence was “enough” at this point to justify having Robinson held without bail. He also cited the seriousness of the manslaughter offense, which could lead to a life sentence. Harris and the attorneys plan to schedule a weight-of-evidence hearing within the week. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Woman charged with manslaughter in shooting death of 45-year-old Barre man.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/washington-court-1-20230807.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 19:05:41.025639

On Monday, Democratic Reps. Corey Paris of Stamford, Eleni Kavros DeGraw of Avon, Gary Turco of Newington and Manny Sanchez of New Britain, held a press conference at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford, where they denounced the Trump administration’s plans and called for more state funding to help beleaguered borrowers.
“The fact that the federal government has made this decision is going to harm families across the nation and especially in Connecticut,” Kavros DeGraw said.
The Office of Federal Student Aid plans to resume collecting defaulted loans on May 5, ending a five-year pause that began during the COVID-19 pandemic and was extended several times since. Tax refunds and other federal benefits could be withheld from borrowers as soon as next month, and some could see their wages garnished by up to 15%. 
The lawmakers at Monday’s event said that could put people already facing financial hardship in an even more difficult situation, and they said the state needs to increase assistance to students seeking higher education. 
“It is time for us to wake up and realize that the time is now,” Turco said. “We are looking to continue our current student loan reimbursement program. We also want to look for more funding from the budget to provide relief,” he said.
In an emailed statement, Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, warned that more state support for student borrowers could mean breaking the state’s fiscal guardrails. “That means they want to raise your state taxes,” he said.
“Ever notice how we never see CT Democrats hold daily news conferences on cutting state government waste and actually lowering our cost of living?’ Harding added.
Federal officials say the move to collect defaulted student loans is intended to protect taxpayers and fix a system they say was confusing for borrowers. 
“American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,” Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement released by her office last week. “The Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear.” 
Students and teachers at Monday’s press conference expressed concern about the personal financial implications the policy could have. 
Christina Barmon, a sociology professor at Central Connecticut State University, said, “It is difficult to console students when I can’t afford to pay either. I am still paying off debts. Students are expected to pick up the slack.”
Syafira Azzahra, a senior at Central, shared her concerns about paying off loans once she graduates. “It is impossible for us to live within our means and simultaneously worry about our debt,” she said.
Last Wednesday, President Donald J. Trump issued a related executive order directing reforms to the higher education accreditation system. The order says accrediting bodies that grant student loans and Pell Grants are biased because of their focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. The order called for establishing new accreditors that are solely merit-based and don’t factor race or gender into decisions.

The murder trial against Seth Brunell ended in a surprise plea deal after a sheriff’s deputy had an unsanctioned conversation with the defendant. It was not the first mistake in the case.

Brunell is accused of killing Fern Feather in 2022. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIn April 2022, the stabbing death of Hinesburg transgender woman Fern Feather shocked and saddened the state of Vermont. In the days after the killing, as the investigation progressed, it emerged that Feather had had an altercation with another man a year prior — a man who, Vermont State Police said, was the son of then-suspect Seth Brunell.That connection could have added key context to the murder case. But, in fact, the man had no relation to Brunell, and state police retracted the claim a day later. The misstep was just one of several mistakes that occurred during one of Vermont’s highest-profile murder cases in the past few years. Earlier this month, after a particularly grave error, that case culminated with a surprise plea deal and a sheriff’s deputy on administrative leave. Brunell pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and will serve a decade of probation with no additional prison time — a far lighter sentence than a murder conviction would entail.  “It’s devastating. I can say that,” said Aliena Gerhard, the Lamoille County state’s attorney. “I was pretty angry.”Even before it reached a trial, the case was a tangled one. Last fall, the case became embroiled in a controversy over evidence, after it emerged in late September that prosecutors had failed to turn over a 3D rendering of the crime scene to Brunell’s defense attorney. The state had mistakenly given the defense a model from a separate case, an error that Gerhard apologized for. Jessica Burke, Brunell’s attorney, asked the court to throw out the case based on that mistake. Presiding Judge Mary Morrissey, however, allowed the trial to go forward, with a postponement to allow the defense to prepare. Still, she wrote, “the court neither minimizes nor excuses the failure of the State” to turn over the 3D model. Morrissey levied a stronger penalty against prosecutors over the handling of another piece of evidence: a 20-page letter, allegedly written by Brunell while he was in prison in 2023. That letter allegedly laid out a plan to have sex with his defense attorney, then accuse her of sexual assault, with the goal of getting his case dismissed, according to court filings. In a court filing at the time, Assistant Attorney General Sophie Stratton sought to admit the letter as evidence in the case. Stratton wrote that prosecutors had only recently learned about the document, even though Vermont State Police had been aware of it for months.But Morrissey ruled that the state had violated time limits for introducing evidence and that the letter could not be admitted. She wrote that “the late disclosure prevented Defendant from conducting depositions, gathering information on the chain of custody, or litigating whether this evidence was properly obtained.” Defense attorney Jessica Burke said last fall that the case was the most disorganized she had ever experienced. Gerhard, the Lamoille County state’s attorney, declined to comment on that letter. Burke declined to comment last week. READ MORE





 


Seth Brunell reaches plea deal in death of Fern Feather with no additional prison time

‘Beyond belief’ The trial finally began in mid-April, three years after the killing of Feather. In her opening statement, Burke, Brunell’s attorney, laid out the defense’s argument that Brunell had acted in self-defense. The case, she argued, was botched from the start. Law enforcement charged Brunell with murder even before they completed processing all the evidence, Burke said. She argued that law enforcement had failed to thoroughly collect evidence, and that officers had allowed Feather’s dogs to roam freely around the crime scene for roughly an hour after the killing, potentially contaminating the scene. But the jury never got a chance to make a decision on those arguments. On May 15, the second full day of the trial, the attorneys learned that Brunell had an unauthorized conversation with a Lamoille County Sheriff’s deputy one day earlier while being driven from the courtroom to Southern State Correctional Facility after jury selection.In testimony, it emerged that Vermont State Police Detective Sergeant Isaac Merriam had asked the sheriff’s department to use a body camera to create a recording during the drive.  “I wanted to make sure that that transport was recorded in case Mr. Brunell made statements about this case,” Merriam told the court. Lamoille County Sheriff’s Department Detective Kevin Lehoe testified that he had passed along Merriam’s request to Sheriff’s Deputy Christopher Turner, who had been assigned to the transport.Although he instructed Turner to record the trip on his body camera, Lehoe said, he had not told him to ask specific questions about the case. The recording was just intended to capture any “excited utterance” that Brunell might make, Lehoe told the court.  Had Lehoe explicitly warned Turner against asking questions? Burke, the defense attorney, asked.“I didn’t at the time, no, and I didn’t expect that I would have to,” Lehoe replied.  But, according to a transcript reviewed by VTDigger, at least one law enforcement officer in the car during the transport did, in fact, ask Brunell questions. Two sheriff’s deputies, Turner and a Rutland County deputy whose identity was not clear, were assigned to the transport. Although the transcript of the conversation is not exact, the document clearly shows that Brunell was questioned about Feather’s car, the knife used in the killing and his relationship with his attorney.Jared Carter, a constitutional law professor with Vermont Law and Graduate School, said that questioning a defendant outside of the presence of their lawyer is a clear violation of the constitutional right to an attorney.“Once a person has been read their Miranda rights, they have the right to an attorney,” Carter said. “And certainly, once that happens, law enforcement is not allowed to continue to question a suspect or a defendant or somebody who’s been arrested.”For the questioning to happen on the eve of a trial is “quite frankly, beyond belief,” he said.Turner, the sheriff’s deputy who conducted the transport of Brunell, was placed on administrative leave while an outside law enforcement agency conducts an investigation, Lamoille County Sheriff Roger Marcoux said earlier this month. READ MORE

‘Gross negligence’On the second night of the trial, Burke filed a motion for a mistrial. In court the next morning, describing the transcript from the body camera, both Burke and Gerhard described the incident as “egregious.”By the end of the next day, with the specter of a mistrial looming, the attorneys had hashed out a plea deal. Prosecutors said that day that they were concerned that, in the case of a mistrial, they would not be able to refile charges against Brunell and that he would ultimately walk completely free.But the 10 years of probation was a far cry from the possibility of the decades in prison Brunell faced if convicted of second-degree murder. And the sentence elicited anger and dismay from Feather’s family and friends. “The only reason you’re getting out now is because of the gross negligence of the Lamoille County Sheriff’s Department,” Lisa Barbeau, Feather’s mother, told Brunell in an emotional statement at the conclusion of the trial. “Because you are a murderer.”In his own remarks, Jean-Francois Barbeau, Feather’s father, condemned the “slap on the wrist” Brunell received.“This isn’t justice. It’s a pitiful parody of justice,” he said. “Fuck you all.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  How a high-profile Vermont murder case fell apart.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/seth-brunell-3-20250415.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 19:05:41.025639

(Photos courtesy of the Doña Ana County Detention Center)Federal authorities arrested a former New Mexico magistrate judge and his wife on April 24 on criminal charges of evidence tampering related to the prosecution of an alleged gang member from Venezuela.
The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday announced it had charged former Doña Ana County Magistrate Jose Luis “Joel” Cano with one count of evidence tampering and his wife Nancy Cano with one count of conspiracy to tamper with evidence.
Prosecutors allege that Jose Cano told Homeland Security Investigations agents that he had destroyed a cell phone belonging to Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, a Venezuelan national prosecutors allege has ties to the Tren de Aragua gang.
HSI in February searched the Canos’ home and arrested Ortega-Lopez for illegal possession of guns and ammunition, according to the DOJ’s news release. The DOJ said agents seized three of Ortega-Lopez’s cell phones, but he told them about a fourth one, which prompted another search wherein Cano allegedly admitted to destroying it with a hammer.
“Judges are responsible for upholding our country’s laws. It is beyond egregious for a former judge and his wife to engage in evidence tampering on behalf of a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member accused of illegally possessing firearms,” U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison for the District of New Mexico said in a statement. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office is committed to dismantling this foreign terrorist organization by disrupting its criminal operations in New Mexico. That starts by prosecuting those who support gang members — including judges.”
The DOJ announced the charges against the Canos in the same news release in which they announced the arrest of a Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan for allegedly allowing a Mexican immigrant charged with domestic violence to temporarily avoid arrest by federal agents.
“The allegations against Judge Dugan and Judge Cano are serious: no one, least of all a judge, should obstruct law enforcement operations,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “Doing so imperils the safety of our law enforcement officers and undermines the rule of law. The Department of Justice will continue to follow the facts — no one is above the law.”
In the New Mexico case, immigration authorities arrested Ortega-Lopez in December 2023 in Texas for unlawfully entering the U.S., and released him in April 2024 because of overcrowding at the detention center where he was being held, according to court records.
An anonymous source in January tipped off the Homeland Security Investigations office in Las Cruces that Ortega-Lopez and two others were living in an apartment behind the Canos’ home, an HSI special agent wrote in an application for a search warrant.
The Judicial Standards Commission on March 5 petitioned the Supreme Court to suspend Cano for allegedly committing misconduct by allowing three members of the gang to live on his property in Las Cruces and to have access to firearms.
In a response, Jose Cano wrote to the Supreme Court justices that Ortega-Lopez told Nancy Cano that the trio “all had their legal papers to remain in the U.S. pending their Asylum Court hearings, which were already scheduled,” and that he had verified their court dates.
Jose Cano resigned as a magistrate judge on March 21, according to court records. The New Mexico Supreme Court on April 22 barred Cano from holding any judicial office or exercising any judicial authority. 
Both Canos are scheduled for preliminary and detention hearings Tuesday morning in federal court in Las Cruces.

Republican leaders in the House and Senate continued Monday to make offers back and forth on spending levels and tax relief, but it wasn’t clear whether the Legislature will have to extend its regular 2025 session to get their work done or adjourn on Friday as planned and come back in a special session.
The new fiscal year opens on July 1.
In a media availability with reporters, Senate President Ben Albritton said his goal is for the Legislature to reach an agreement on overall spending and tax relief and extend into next week and “be able to get everything done.”
To that end, Senate Budget Committee Chair Ed Hooper said the Senate had made an offer to the House Monday afternoon and was waiting to hear back. Hooper did not disclose details of the offer, other than to say it was the seventh one he has made to the House.
The Senate had not heard back before Albritton and Hooper addressed reporters.
“You know what the priority of the speaker is, and we are trying to meet him at an affordable number,” Hooper said, adding, “We’re very close on the number.”
Dispute over taxes
The House on Friday voted, 78-29, to pass a $5 billion tax relief package, with most of the opposition involving changes to the collection of tourist development dollars.
Albritton supports tax relief but earlier this session floated a more modest $2.1 billion tax plan, centered around a permanent elimination of the sales tax on clothing and shoes costing $75 or less. Other parts of his plan include a permanent reduction in the business rent tax from 2% to 1%, a one-time credit for vehicle registration fees, and several sales tax holidays.
The difference between the House and Senate proposals for fiscal year 2025-26 is $4.4 billion. Albritton said people shouldn’t focus on the disparity between the chambers and instead focus on the fact that both the House and Senate support large tax cuts.
“We’re contemplating historic tax relief for Floridians. I don’t want that message to be lost. We’re just trying to figure out how it all comes together and everybody gets a piece of it to where they can feel comfortable that the thing they want to address gets addressed,” Albritton said, calling it “great news for Floridians.”
The legislative impasse on spending and tax relief has also slowed down the chambers’ deliberations on substantive policy issues, a reflection that how the chambers negotiate differences on substantive policies can be tied to the budget.
‘Nothingburgers’
Meanwhile, with less than one week left to go just 54 bills have made it through the legislative process, clearing both the House and Senate. Gov. DeSantis has signed 10 of them into law.
The House had passed 230 bills as of April 28, of which 49 have also been passed by the Senate.
The Senate had passed 156 bills, of which five have been passed by the House.
“Very little has passed and everything that has passed is nothingburgers,” one longtime lobbyist told the Florida Phoenix.
One high-profile bill that hasn’t passed but Albritton is optimistic will wind up making it through this week is a condominium bill by Sen. Jennifer Bradley.
Albritton said Sen. Jennifer Bradley, chair of the Regulated Industries Committee, is having conversation with the House, “making great progress,” on the condo bill and he is “very optimistic” about it. That measure involves relief for condo owners burdened by high assessments to improve building safety.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas environmental regulators updated the state Pollution Control and Ecology Commission last week on efforts to help storm-stricken areas of the state recover from multiple rounds of severe weather.
The commission also gave final approval to state water quality standards that address surface water pollutants and are up for review.
Bailey Taylor, director of the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality, said the agency issued an emergency order to address a large spill of red dye diesel in Craighead County. The tanks storing the fuel were severely damaged after being struck by one of the many tornadoes that have touched down in the state over the last month and a half, Taylor said.
The emergency order, which was posted on DEQ’s website, said the fuel leaked into ditches that “flowed through a nearby residential area and near the Monette Manor nursing home,” with the potential to reach the St. Francis River. The order noted that heavy concentrations of the diesel were seen in the ditches by a government inspector who visited the site.
“Given the extent of the storm impact and damage, imminent heavy rainfall and the forecast for additional severe weather and heavy flooding in the area, it was apparent that immediate action was required to protect human health and safety as well as to mitigate further impact to waters of the state including the St. Francis River,” the emergency order read. 
Taylor said she ordered remediation contractors to the site, and authorized use of funds from the Remedial Action Trust Fund to address the spill if it was necessary to protect public health, safety or the environment on April 3.
Additionally, DEQ staff has been working with local and county officials to set up debris burn sites for trees and other plants, Taylor said, and has been doing additional outreach to areas not impacted by recent storms to plan where a burn site could be, should those communities be affected by storms in the future.
Taylor also updated commissioners on legislative activity, saying that 12 bills proposed by the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment had been signed into law, most of them bills aimed at cleaning up language in existing law.
Later, commissioners voted to give final approval to Rule 2, which governs the state’s water quality standards and is going through a federally-mandated triennial review. The rule will now go to the Arkansas Legislative Council’s rules committee, and then to the council itself, for review.
Rule 2 water quality standards apply to the concentrations of pollutants in surface waters themselves, such as lakes and rivers, rather than the concentrations of pollutants in discharges from permitted facilities. They are also separate from drinking water regulations, which rely on a different set of rules and laws at both the federal and state level, and are regulated by the Arkansas Department of Health rather than DEQ.
The changes proposed by DEQ to Rule 2 include the addition of five new regulated pollutants: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and phenol. Two of those — benzene and ethylbenzene — are known or suspected carcinogens, respectively. The other three are known to have other detrimental health effects in humans in sufficient concentrations.
In documentation included with the rulemaking, DEQ said the new water quality standards were necessary to protect human health.
In addition to the new standards, DEQ is also proposing updates to existing ammonia and chromium standards.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ALP_0026-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 19:05:41.025639

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A committee of lawmakers on Monday rejected a last-minute bill to make legislators and higher education officials mandatory reporters of child sexual abuse in light of new documents that show a University of North Dakota official may have known about sex crimes committed by former Sen. Ray Holmberg.
Holmberg, who served in the statehouse for more than four decades, was sentenced to 10 years in prison late last month after he pleaded guilty to traveling abroad with the intent to have sex with adolescent boys.
The records, which were released by the Attorney General’s Office on Friday and number over 90 pages, show Holmberg emailed UND entrepreneur Bruce Gjovig in February 2011 about the former senator’s preference for young men and boys. Gjovig founded the school’s Center for Innovation, retiring in 2017. Gjovig also held other prominent roles in the community and the Republican Party.

“What think of my twink?” Holmberg asked Gjovig in the email, using a slang term that refers to young, slim men.
Gjovig emailed back, “too young for me, but thanks.”
“No one is ever to young… remember Prague,” Holmberg replied.
Gjovig’s attorney, Cash Aaland, said in a statement that Gjovig believed the comments were exaggerated, “bawdry, locker room” talk.
“Although Mr. Gjovig knew Mr. Holmberg in a professional and personal capacity, Mr. Gjovig was unaware of the criminal nature of Mr. Holmberg’s sexual conduct,” Aaland said in the statement. “Mr. Gjovig condemns Holmberg’s activities in the strongest terms possible.”
Aaland said that Gjovig fully cooperated with law enforcement during the investigation into Holmberg, and that Gjovig is being painted as an accomplice without evidence.
“As a gay man and a Republican, Mr. Gjovig has been an easy mark for political and media attacks,” Aaland stated.

The records also show that Holmberg emailed former state Sen. Nick Hacker in August 2016 about a sexual encounter Holmberg had with someone in Taiwan. Hacker was a State Board of Higher Education member at the time.
Holmberg did not say in the email that the person in question was underage, or that it was commercial sex.
Hacker, who served in the Senate from 2005 to 2008, said that the email was unsolicited and that he did not reply.
“I don’t even recall getting that email,” he said.
Hacker said he met with the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation in 2022 and cooperated with the agency’s investigation of Holmberg, including giving investigators full access to his messages.
“Until I met with BCI in 2022, I was unaware that Mr. Holmberg was a predator of underage children,” Hacker said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor. “Individuals like him should be fully prosecuted under the law.”
Others employed by the University of North Dakota also received emails from Holmberg, records show.
Sen. Tim Mathern and other North Dakota Democratic lawmakers in a Monday morning press conference urged the Legislature to greenlight a delayed bill to make lawmakers and higher education employees mandatory reporters of child sex abuse.
“In the future, if this comes to your attention and mine, we will know that it’s our responsibility. I think each one of us needs guardrails to help us make good decisions,” Mathern told other senators in a Senate Delayed Bills Committee hearing that afternoon.
The committee voted 4-1 not to forward the proposal, arguing a mandatory reporting requirement is not necessary and that it is too late in the session to accept the bill. Mathern was the only no vote.
North Dakota Senate kills mandated reporter bill spurred by Holmberg case

Mathern’s peers on the Senate Delayed Bills Committee said they did not feel the bill would make a difference because they did not know of Holmberg’s crimes until he was charged. 
“If we would have known something, we would have said something,” said Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden.
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, and Sen. Scott Meyer, R-Grand Forks, suggested taking up the proposal next legislative session.
“Who knew or didn’t know, even in the last 90-page report, is just hearsay,” Myrdal said. 
The other member of the committee was Sen. Cole Conley, R-Jamestown.
The communications in the report were found on electronic devices seized by law enforcement belonging to Ray Holmberg and another subject, Nicholas Morgan-Derosier. Morgan-Derosier was an associate of Holmberg’s who was sentenced in May to 40 years in prison on child pornography charges.
Members of the committee also said that the higher education system may already have mandatory requirements in place. 
A spokesperson for the North Dakota University System said there is no blanket requirement for employees to report sexual abuse, though certain kinds of officeholders and staff have their own reporting mandates. For example, members of the higher education board and employees must report any suspected violations of laws or institutional policies to a designee within the University System.
Statehouse Democrats said during the press conference it is unacceptable that some officials knew or may have known about Holmberg’s conduct years before he was charged with a crime. They said that North Dakota law does not do enough to prevent officials from engaging in, or covering up, crimes against children. 
“It’s obvious that just trusting these people to do the right thing is not good enough,” Mathern said. “We owe it to Holmberg’s victims to do something about it.”
The Senate previously defeated a resolution sponsored by Rep. Nico Rios, R-Williston, and the North Dakota Young Republicans that would have called on the 2027 Legislature to make lawmakers mandatory reporters.
It’s not yet clear whether the University of North Dakota has investigated or plans to investigate Holmberg.  
“If a report is filed with the university, it would be investigated,” David Dodds, a university spokesperson, said in a statement to the Monitor. 
“We are aware and deeply troubled by recent media reports regarding previously sealed federal court documents that were unavailable to the University and were used in the criminal conviction of Ray Holmberg,” Dodds said. “We strongly condemn the actions of anyone who may have enabled Mr. Holmberg’s criminal behavior.”
The University System is drafting a child safety policy that would apply to minors participating in programs that take place on property regulated by the higher education board or are sponsored by the University System, spokesperson Billie Jo Lorius said in an email to the North Dakota Monitor. She said the policy has yet to be approved.
Rep. Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks, said during the press conference he hopes the state Legislature isn’t the only body that implements reforms in response to the Holmberg case.
“I think this is a time for all individuals and institutions to carefully reflect on where their failures were in this process,” Ista said.
Mathern also called on his colleagues to put more money in the North Dakota Ethics Commission’s budget for the 2025-2027 fiscal year. He is chair of the conference committee tasked with workshopping final amendments to the budget, Senate Bill 2004.
“This would be a step forward toward justice as we continue to process Holmberg’s vile crimes and uncover more information on what has become the most egregious scandal in our state’s history,” Mathern said.
The Senate initially set aside money for an additional full-time employee for the commission, which would have brought the board’s number of staff up to four. The House cut the funding and also added a new 180-day deadline for the commission to process ethics complaints.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)  While Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Senate Republicans said Monday they have reached a “budget compromise” on how to fund the state heading into the 2026 fiscal year, House Republicans are asking for more money in some areas.
Passing the state budget through a series of appropriations bills is one of Iowa Legislature’s largest jobs, and the final step before lawmakers can adjourn for the year. In Iowa, the goal is for state legislators to wrap up their work by the 110th day of session — this year on Friday, May 2. There’s a financial motivation for lawmakers to finish their work by or near this date, after which they will no longer receive payment for expenses other than mileage between their homes and the State Capitol.
As of Monday, four days before the May 2 deadline, only one budget bill, Senate File 628, has passed through the committee process. The Senate’s transportation budget bill was approved by the chamber last week, but has not yet been taken up in the House. But there was movement Monday to kick off public discussions on the rest of the budget as House Republicans released their spending targets for the upcoming fiscal year.
Also on Monday, Reynolds and Senate Republicans issued a news release stating they had reached a “budget compromise” that leaders said will continue the Republican trifecta’s work of lowering costs for Iowans.
“We cut taxes to ensure Iowans could keep more of their hard-earned money, and we must maintain spending discipline to ensure it stays that way,” Reynolds said in a statement Monday. “Iowa remains on a strong fiscally sustainable path, and we should continue our focus on putting taxpayers first.”
House Speaker Pat Grassley said in a news release the House Republicans budget also follows conservative fiscal beliefs while providing needed state financial support for services Iowans care about.
“Our caucus is committed to delivering a budget that follows responsible budget practices, while funding the priorities Iowans care most about,” Grassley said in a statement. “Iowans expect to see their tax dollars used wisely to fund important services like nursing homes, paraprofessional pay, support for human trafficking victims, and more of that sort, and that’s what this House Republican caucus is fighting to deliver.”
The House plan would give Iowa a state budget of $9.45 billion in FY 2026, an increase of $506 million, or 5.65%, from FY 2025. It’s a higher target than the $9.41 billion budget agreed upon between the Senate and Reynolds.
Comparing the two budget proposals, the differences are:

A roughly $1 million difference for the Administration and Regulations budget, the appropriations for the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals, and Licensing (DIAL), the departments of Administrative Services and Revenue, as well as other state agencies and offices including the Secretary of State’s Office. The Senate target is $73.5 million, and the House’s is $74.5 million.
The House also set a $1.7 million higher budget target in the Agriculture and Natural Resources budget than the Senate and governor are proposing. This funding, going to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, Department of Natural Resources and related outdoors and farming services, has a Senate GOP target of $45.6 million and House GOP target of $47.3 million.
For Economic Development appropriations, the House is asking for $450,000 more, a total of roughly $40.6 million, compared to the Senate and Reynolds’ $40.2 million target. This pot of funding goes to the Iowa Economic Development Authority, Iowa Finance Authority, Iowa Department of Workforce Development and related entities.
There’s a larger difference in the Education funding goals between the two chambers projections — House Republicans are asking for $15 million more in the education appropriations bill than what the Senate and governor’s plan provides. This funding is separate from State Supplemental Aid, the per-pupil funding going to Iowa’s K-12 schools. This money heads to the state Department of Education, public universities governed by the state Board of Regents, the Department for the Blind and other education-related services. The Senate’s budget goal is set at $1,026,386,031, and the House at $1,042,264,716.
Health and Human Services is the one of the two funding categories where the Senate and Reynolds’ plan has a higher funding target than the House’s plan. The Senate and governor are asking for nearly $500,000 more for the appropriations bill that goes to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Veteran Affairs. The Senate’s budget target is $2,468,992,645 and the House’s is $2,468,514,264.
For the Justice System and Judicial Branch, the House is asking for roughly $3 million more in funding, with the Senate goal set at $925.9 million and the House at $928.9 million. These funds will go to the state’s judicial system, as well as state law enforcement entities, the Iowa Department of Justice and Department of Corrections.
The chambers’ goals for standings appropriations — typically a grab bag of other state funding obligations that includes the state SSA funding — public K-12 school funding — is the other area where the Senate has a higher target set than the House. The Senate is asking for $4,836,758,719 in standings, while the House is asking for $4,851,312,672. A majority of this money has already been designated through SSA for K-12 funding, but there is still a $3 million difference between the two budget goals for the measure.

As of Monday afternoon, the House budget bills have not yet been released, and not all the specific items causing disagreements between the Senate and House Republicans’ on spending priorities are public. House Republicans said in a news release that budget subcommittees “will continue their work to finalize their individual budgets.”
However, Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, the House Appropriations chair, highlighted increased funding for community colleges and continued support for the paraeducator pay increase included in last year’s bill making changes to the state’s Area Education Agencies system as priorities for House Republicans.
“As Iowa House Republicans, we have built our reputation on passing responsible budgets that have allowed us to lower the tax burden while funding Iowans’ budget priorities,” Mohr said in a statement. “… We are prepared to deliver once again on the promises we make to our constituents.”
Democrats criticized Republicans’ spending goals, stating the GOP budgets provide more money to wealthy Iowans while cutting funding going to those in need. Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo, denounced Republicans’ budget for including a 44% increase for the state Education Savings Account program, providing state funds for private school tuition and associated costs that will have no income limits beginning in the 2025-2026 school year, and for providing “another $1 billion tax break to corporations that lay off workers.”
“Iowa Republicans have the wrong budget priorities, and plan to spend more than the state takes in forcing the state to borrow money for ongoing expenses,” Brown-Powers said in a statement. “As costs continue to rise for families, House Democrats will fight to lower costs for Iowans and pass a fiscally responsible budget.”
Senate Republicans said they plan to hold subcommittee and committee meetings on their budget bills this week.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch )The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted an emergency waiver permitting the nationwide sale of a fuel blend with higher amounts of ethanol through the summer months, which Iowa fuel and farm leaders say will help farmers, fuel producers and Iowans at the pumps. 
Midwestern states, including Iowa, already had waivers in place to allow for summer sales of fuel blended with 15% ethanol, also known as E15. EPA’s decision Monday waives the agency’s summer restrictions on the fuel for the rest of the country and follows guidance from the president’s executive order from January, declaring a national energy emergency. 
The press release from EPA said the move will “provide families with relief” by providing more options at the pump with lower prices per gallon. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig applauded the decision and said Iowa drivers saved more than $38 million by choosing E15 over E10, a lower blend of ethanol fuel, in 2024. 
“Today’s E15 announcement by the Trump Administration is a win for consumers across the U.S. and farmers here in Iowa,” Naig said in a statement. “This decision is a big step toward making our country more energy dominant, independent, and secure.” 
Iowa Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley both applauded the measure, noting it was an example of “promises made, promises kept” by the president and would be a “big” boost for corn farmers. 
“It’s clear (President Trump) is making our farmers, producers, and all of rural America a priority, and I look forward to working alongside him to secure permanent, nationwide access to this cleaner, cheaper choice at the pump,” Ernst said in a statement.
According to National Corn Growers Association, year-round E15 sales throughout the country would lead to an increased demand of more than 2 billion bushels of corn annually, which is why the group has pushed for increased ethanol demand. 
Brent Johnson, president of Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, applauded the EPA decision, but noted EPA has consistently issued similar waivers, and urged for a permanent change to the rule. 
“Clearly, there is strong consumer demand for a lower-cost fuel option at the pump, and Iowa farmers stand by readily able to meet the growing demand for biofuels,” Johnson said in a statement.
Naig similarly noted the need for a permanent regulation allowing the sale of the fuel. He, along with Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and industry groups have all sent letters to congressional leaders urging the passage of such a law. 
“We are tired of waiting,” Monte Shaw, executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement. “Consumers and retailers are tired of waiting. E15 could provide a market for 5 to 7 billion gallons of additional ethanol demand at a time when American farmers and rural communities are hurting.”
The EPA waiver is in place from May 1 through May 20, as the Clean Air Act only allows a 20-day waiver, but considering trends from the past several summers, industry leaders expect the waiver will be extended through the other summer months.

Glenn Youngkin's request that he drop out. (Photo courtesy of John Reid)The internal drama roiling Virginia Republicans deepened over the weekend as John Reid, the party’s embattled nominee for lieutenant governor, accused Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s political action committee of extortion — escalating an already explosive rift just months before November’s elections.
In a defiant video posted Sunday afternoon on X, formerly Twitter, Reid alleged that a representative of Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC told his team the organization would purchase damaging opposition research and “the lies and threats against me would suddenly stop” if he agreed to drop out of the race. 
The allegations come just 48 hours after it became public that Youngkin had personally asked Reid to withdraw over concerns about a social media account linked to explicit content.
Reid, a conservative radio host and the first openly gay statewide candidate from either party in Virginia, said he had hoped the controversy would settle, but instead the pressure had intensified.
“I had certainly hoped that we could put the bigotry and ugliness of last week behind us and unify our Republican ticket this year,” Reid said in the video. “But shockingly, once again representatives of my campaign have been told by the leader of Governor Youngkin’s political organization that the attacks on me will continue unless I drop out of the race for lieutenant governor.”
Spirit of Virginia is headed by political consultant Matt Moran, vice president of Creative Direct.
Under Virginia law, it is a crime to threaten a person’s reputation, safety, property, or immigration status in order to extort money, property, or any financial benefit. Specifically, the law classifies it as a Class 5 felony to use threats, accusations of criminal conduct, or the misuse of immigration documents as leverage for financial or personal gain.
However, Eric Claville, a political and legal analyst at Norfolk State University, urged caution before drawing any legal conclusions from Reid’s allegations. 
“This is politics, and politics is all about perception, and with that being the case, I would not want to speak on the legality of it, because we don’t have all the evidence,” Claville said. “We can only speculate, and that’s what both sides are doing now.”
Claville noted that while Reid’s accusations may stir public outrage, proving criminal conduct would require far more than speculation. 
“When you take a look at what has transpired, it is all speculation and hearsay. Therefore, in the legal court, that would have to be tried out and also go through the legal process in order to make a determination,” he said. “However, in the court of public opinion, which is different from a legal proceeding, it basically comes down to the rules of what is reality and what is not, as it relates to the audience, or the public at large.”
For now, Claville said, Reid appears to have the stronger public narrative. 
“You have candidate Reid making a strong case on his end, and there really is not a strong rebuttal on the other end,” he said. “So at this point, that’s going to have to go through the legal proceedings and of course, the court of public opinion.”
Ultimately, Claville emphasized that the larger issue is mostly political. 
“At the end of the day, the question is, what is the impact upon the ticket – and that impact is massive, and they’re going to have to determine if this is a viable path forward to be competitive in the upcoming election,” he said. 
As of late Monday afternoon, Republican leadership remained notably silent. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears — the party’s nominee for governor and the headliner of the statewide GOP ticket — has yet to weigh in on the controversy. 
A spokeswoman for Earle-Sears’ campaign and a spokesman for Spirit of Virginia did not respond to multiple phone calls and text messages. Neither did Ken Nunnenkamp, the party’s executive director. Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, the newly elected chair of the Republican Party of Virginia, declined to comment Monday.
Adding to the signs of turmoil, an event scheduled for Wednesday at Atlas 42 in Henrico County featuring the statewide Republican ticket — with Youngkin billed as a special guest — has been canceled, according to a report by Virginia Scope.
Even as the controversy swirled, Reid was set to appear Monday evening at a rally hosted by the Loudoun County Republican Committee in Sterling. Loudoun GOP Chair Scott Pio told The Mercury that the event would go forward as planned and that Reid continued to have his support.
“The Republican Party has been removing staunch Republicans for the past three years from elected office all across the state because they’re unhappy with conservatism being pushed,” Pio said, voicing his frustration with efforts to boot Reid off the ticket.
In his video, Reid did not mince words about the pressure he said he faced. 
“This is extortion and it is illegal in Virginia, and I am more outraged now,” he said of the proposal his campaign received from Youngkin’s PAC. Reid added that he has engaged legal counsel to “pursue all options” and slammed what he called the arrogance of party insiders trying to oust him after he became the legal nominee.
“The insiders in Virginia politics made a big miscalculation if they thought that I would bow down to anyone or run away scared,” he said. “I’m a conservative Trump supporter and I’m gay, and everybody knows it because I’ve told you in person and in the media for decades.”
The latest twist follows days of escalating conflict that first broke into public view Friday when The Richmonder reported that Youngkin had privately urged Reid to withdraw after a Tumblr account — bearing the same username Reid uses elsewhere — surfaced featuring sexually explicit content. A spokesperson for Youngkin’s PAC said the governor learned of the account late Thursday and called Reid the next morning.
“The governor was made aware late Thursday of the disturbing online content. Friday morning, in a call with Mr. Reid, the Governor asked him to step down as the lieutenant governor nominee,” Spirit of Virginia said in a statement.
Reid denied the account was his, countering in an earlier video that “anyone on the internet can open accounts with the same or similar names as other people,” and saying he had never publicly performed or posted pornographic material.
Reid said while he expected “harassment and vulgar attacks” from “radical” Republicans and “angry leftists,” he did not expect Youngkin, whom he had long supported, to call for his resignation “without even showing me the supposed evidence or offering me a chance to respond.”
“I did not accept that and I deeply resent it,” he said.
Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said the turmoil surrounding Reid’s candidacy highlights deeper challenges for Virginia Republicans heading into a critical election cycle.
“The biggest challenge that you have as a first-time statewide candidate is getting your name out there in the public,” Farnsworth said. “That’s not going to be a problem for John Reid.” But, he cautioned, the downside is significant: “This controversy won’t help Reid or the Republican ticket.”
Farnsworth noted the predicament reflects broader tensions within the GOP. 
“It is a very difficult situation for Republicans to both keep the enthusiasm of evangelical Christian voters and reach out to an increasingly visible gay segment of the electorate in Virginia,” he said. While Republicans have long struggled with balancing those constituencies, Farnsworth said, “it is certainly a more intense one right now, particularly given the governor’s rebuffed efforts to avoid a bigger controversy.”
Ultimately, Farnsworth argued, the situation adds yet another complication to an already challenging election year for Virginia Republicans. 
“The Republican party did not need another problem this year,” he said.
Reid’s unexpected ascent to the ticket came after Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity dropped out for health reasons last week. Had Reid agreed to withdraw, the Republican Party of Virginia’s state central committee would have been tasked with picking a replacement, Peake previously confirmed.
The controversy also unfolds against the backdrop of a broader debate over LGBTQ rights, as the General Assembly advances a constitutional amendment to erase a now-defunct ban on same-sex marriage — an issue that has divided Republicans, with many in the House and Senate either voting no or abstaining.

Senate Bill 2160 would have moved the state’s insurance to a plan that offers benefits compliant with the federal Affordable Care Act.
Supporters of the bill said it would have given more flexibility to the state over health insurance plan options and would have provided better coverage of preventative care. Opponents said it could lead to employees paying health insurance premiums, which they don’t currently.
North Dakota House approves change to state health insurance plan

In Armstrong’s veto message to the Senate, he said the state’s health plans are one of the most valued benefits for state employees. He added it was one of the state’s “strongest and most useful recruitment and retention tools.”
“Senate Bill 2160 disposes of that tool and replaces it with a more expensive alternative,” Armstrong wrote.
The health plan switch was estimated to cost at least $25.8 million every two years, according to the governor’s office.
“The current health plan is better for state employees and employees of political subdivisions,” Armstrong wrote. He added, if the bill were to become law, state employees and employees of political subdivisions would have been put in separate health insurance pools, which would have raised the cost on both groups.
The vetoed bill will now go back to the Senate. It would take a two-thirds majority vote to override the governor’s veto.
The Senate passed the bill 44-2.

SB 1270 was one of a slew of bills that the Florida Senate chose to temporarily pass. That means the chamber puts the debate over a bill on hold for the time being. Senate leaders said they intend to vote on the health bill time permitting as the session enters it’s final scheduled week and the state budget for next fiscal year still subject to House-Senate negotiation.
Sen. Jay Collins is the bill sponsor.
The bill amends the existing “Florida Patient’s Bill of Rights” to permanently permanently enshrine policy changes regarding vaccinations that DeSantis put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The bill is problematic for Sen. Gayle Harrell, who worries that it opens physicians to increased medical malpractice lawsuits because it requires physicians to treat patients regardless of whether they reject their advice to be vaccinated. 
Another section of SB 1270 includes a fix to a 2024 law to allow the Florida Board of Medicine to approve an applicant’s licensure by endorsement in certain circumstances, a move that the board supports. That’s the route for any doctor who holds a medical license in one state to apply to practice in another.
The 2024 law law quashed the board’s ability approve by endorsement any physician applying for Florida licensure who:

 Has a complaint, an allegation, or an investigation pending before a licensing entity in another state or territory.
Has been convicted of, or pleaded no contest to, any felony or misdemeanor related to the practice of a healthcare profession, regardless of adjudication, 
Has had a healthcare provider license revoked or suspended by another state,
Has voluntarily surrendered any license in lieu of having disciplinary action taken against the license.
Has been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank, which includes medical malpractice settlements.

The National Practitioner Data Bank includes information on medical malpractice settlements.
SB 1270 allows the Board of Medicine to approve an applicant’s licensure by endorsement as long as the offense reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank “would not constitute a violation of any law or rule in this state.”

Phil Bryant to the FEMA Review Council, which Trump has tasked to “fix a terribly broken system” and shift disaster response and recovery from federal to state government.
The appointment comes as Mississippi awaits a response from the Trump administration on whether it will approve Gov. Tate Reeves’ request for a federal disaster declaration for deadly tornadoes in mid-March. The federal declaration, which Reeves requested April 1, would allow families and local governments devastated by the storms to receive federal assistance. Trump recently denied a similar request for Arkansas.
Trump has said states should shoulder more of the burden for disaster response and recovery, and he and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have threatened to shut down the Federal Emergency Management Agency altogether.
“I am proud to announce the formation of the FEMA Review Council, comprised of Top Experts in their fields, who are Highly Respected by their peers,” Trump wrote on social media. “… I know that the new Members will work hard to fix a terribly broken System, and return power to State Emergency Managers, who will help, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.”
Trump listed other members of the council, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia.
Bryant, a longtime political ally of Trump, on social media wrote he is, “Honored to receive this appointment …” and that “Unfortunately, we’ve earned a lot of experience with natural disasters and recovery in Mississippi. Let’s Make America Safe Again.”
Mississippi saw seven deaths and an estimated $18 million in destruction from multiple tornadoes on March 14-15, the same storm system that caused damage in Arkansas. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency reported that 233 homes were destroyed across 14 counties, and hundreds more were damaged.
During the initial aftermath, Reeves told reporters he believed there was a “high likelihood” the state’s damages from the March tornadoes would meet the threshold for FEMA’s Individual Assistance, which provides direct payments to disaster victims.
The Trump administration’s FEMA has denied federal assistance for flooding in West Virginia, tornadoes in Arkansas and a storm in Washington state, and refused North Carolina’s request for extending relief after Hurricane Helene.
After Hurricane Katrina’s devastation in 2005, Mississippi received nearly $25 billion in federal relief spending, which state leaders have credited with saving the state from ruin and allowing communities and families to rebuild.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/07041842/AP_17343600123362-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-28 18:07:23.906936

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — After a private meeting with state Superintendent Ryan Walters, Republican lawmakers made no promises that a leading state senator’s resolution would succeed in rejecting new academic standards proposed for social studies and science education.
Senate Education Committee chairperson Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, filed the resolution Thursday afternoon after half of the Oklahoma State Board of Education said they weren’t aware of changes made to the social studies standards before they approved them in February. Pugh declined to comment while exiting a closed-door Senate Republican Caucus meeting Monday.
Walters joined the caucus meeting midway through. Afterward, he declined to share details of what he discussed but said he had a “great conversation” and “appreciated the invite.”

Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said after the meeting the GOP majority is still discussing whether it will put Pugh’s resolution up for a vote by the full Senate. In previous weeks, he said there hadn’t been “a whole lot of movement to reject those standards” among the caucus.
Both the Senate and the House must agree on a resolution by Thursday to take any action on the standards. State law gives lawmakers 30 legislative days after receiving academic standards to consider them and vote. If the Legislature doesn’t pass a resolution, the standards will take effect as written. 
Academic standards dictate the topics that public schools must teach to students. They are reviewed and updated every six years.
Five House members signed on as co-authors of Pugh’s resolution on Monday, including the chamber’s No. 2 Republican leader, Speaker Pro Tem Anthony Moore, R-Clinton. 
The group of co-authors also includes Common Education Committee Chairperson Dick Lowe, R-Amber; the committee’s Vice Chairperson Danny Sterling, R-Tecumseh; Rep. Tammy West, R-Oklahoma City; and Rep. Mike Osburn, R-Edmond, who is listed as the principal House author.
Lowe said lawmakers are troubled by the review and approval process that took place with the state Board of Education, rather than about the contents of the standards. Many of the constituents living in their House districts are concerned, as well, he said.

“We see the process was probably not as transparent as we’d like to see in state government,” Lowe said.
Pugh’s resolution similarly notes that “questions exist regarding the transparency of the subject matter standard adoption process.”
Whether the House has the chance to vote on the resolution depends on the Senate passing it first. Lowe said it then would be “a leadership decision” whether the resolution would get a hearing in the House.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, will comment on the resolution if it passes the Senate and comes over to his chamber, his spokesperson said.
Gov. Kevin Stitt and one of his recent state Board of Education appointees, Ryan Deatherage, said they would like the Legislature to send the social studies standards back to the board for another vote. Stitt raised doubts about whether Walters’ administration handled the process with the proper integrity.
Walters denied the governor’s claims that the Oklahoma State Department of Education emailed board members a different version of the proposed standards from what they ultimately approved. 
The Education Department provided email records indicating board members received a copy of the final draft at 4 p.m. the day before they met the following morning of Feb. 27 to vote on the standards. The board voted 5-1 to approve the standards and send them to the Legislature for final review.
The only board member who voted against them, Deatherage, said he hadn’t had enough time to read through the lengthy document.

He and two other board members, Chris Van Denhende and Mike Tinney, said Thursday they weren’t aware at the time of the vote of changes made from the original draft of the standards, which were posted publicly in December.
Some of the changes include the addition of language stating there were “discrepancies” in 2020 election results, including “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”
Walters said he made the final decision to add the new language after his administration received public comment and input from focus groups. National conservative media personalities and Republican policy advocates made up the leading committee that reviewed the social studies standards.
Pugh’s resolution points out the short timeframe that the board had to review the updated version. It also noted that the governor and board members requested the standards be returned to the state Board of Education “for proper review and consideration.”

Given “the magnitude of the decision” and the $33 million cost to implement the new standards, the resolution proposes the Legislature reject them in full for both social studies and science.
House and Senate Democrats filed resolutions last month to reject the social studies standards. Last week, they again urged their Republican colleagues to take action before Walters’ proposal becomes mandatory teaching in all public schools.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, thought of how the new language would mix with the social studies homework her eighth grader brings home from public school.
“This week we talked about Brown v. Board of Education,” Kirt said during a news conference Wednesday. “We talked about Plessy v. Ferguson. We’re talking about very important concepts in history and social studies, and thinking about teachers having to try to present some of these (new) standards and my children trying to analyze them and understand the angle of them and to have critical thinking around them really deeply concerns me.”

(Photo by Felipe Cuevas/TelevisaUnivision)A majority of Florida Hispanic voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction and blame Donald Trump’s administration for that negative trajectory, according to a poll released on Monday.
The survey, titled the “First 100 Days Bipartisan Poll of the Hispanic Electorate,” was conducted by BSP Research for UnidosUS, Voces Unidas, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), and Climate Power en Acción. Pollsters conducted interviews in English and Spanish of 1,002 voters nationwide, and 158 in Florida.
The survey of those Florida Hispanic voters shows that 57% believe the country is going in the wrong direction, with 70% of those saying that President Trump and his administration are responsible.
The cost of living/inflation and jobs and the economy were the most important issues for voters surveyed in Florida, although they gave Republicans a one-point lead, 36%-35%, on which party is best equipped to address those issues. Another 18% said neither party, while 12% said both parties.
Regarding immigration, only 17% of Florida Hispanic voters support deporting all undocumented immigrants, no matter how long they have lived in the United States, while 56% support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have been here a long time.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced on Saturday that the agency and state law enforcement in Florida arrested nearly 800 people over four days in a “massive, multi-agency immigration enforcement crackdown,” a move celebrated by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Of the 158 Florida voters surveyed in the poll, 49% said they voted for Trump last fall and 47% for Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump defeated Harris, 56%-43%, in Florida, and Florida Hispanics went for Trump by that same breakdown, according to an exit survey of 500 voters in Florida conducted by the 2024 American Electorate Poll of Hispanic Voters.

State housing leaders are celebrating the opening of 65 new units but worry that federal cuts may be coming to the systems that support affordable housing.

Now, affordable housing providers are looking at a much more austere funding landscape: one where they fear deep federal cuts to housing programs are soon in store.“Federal resources will likely no longer be available in the future, and low-income people who rely on a very shaky safety net will soon see that net cut into pieces,” said Michael Monte, the CEO of the housing trust, at a ribbon-cutting event on Monday.Vermont’s housing sphere has seen the initial impacts of the Trump administration’s sweeping staffing and spending cuts, from clawbacks of grants for anti-discrimination work and the sudden terminations of voluntary corps workers building homes. Neighborworks, a congressionally-chartered nonprofit that helped fund the Colchester apartments, has recently come under the security of the Department of Government Efficiency. But housing leaders worry that deeper federal cuts to affordable housing funding and rental assistance programs could be coming – and they fear the state wouldn’t have enough capacity to backfill potential cuts. Nearly a third of the Colchester project’s $31.6 million price tag came from pandemic-era federal funds, said Nancy Owens, president of Evernorth, a co-developer of the project. Amid Vermont’s worsening levels of homelessness, she implored state leaders to find new funding sources for subsidized housing.Michael Monte, CEO of Champlain Housing Trust, speaks at a ribbon cutting event for an affordable housing project in Colchester on Monday, April 28th. Photo by Carly Berlin/VTDigger and Vermont Public“We need to secure more substantial permanent resources to fund housing – for the production of new homes in Vermont. If we don’t, really, the pace of this development will come to a standstill,” Owens said.The three buildings that house the 65 apartments have a long history. During the early 20th century, they served as barracks to one of the first Black U.S. Army regiments in peacetime after the Civil War – who were deployed to clear western lands of indigenous people. The entryways of the buildings have signs documenting that past. More recently, the buildings served as dorms and offices for nearby St. Michael’s College. Studio apartments will rent for $1,100, and one-bedrooms list for $1,250. Eighteen of the apartments have deeper subsidies from the Burlington Housing Authority, meaning rents will be capped at one third of the tenant’s income. (Median rent plus utilities in Chittenden County in 2023 was about $1,600).READ MORE

Only 125 of the 720 homes built in Vermont’s most populous county in 2023 were considered affordable, falling short of housing leaders’ goals. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Affordable apartments open in Colchester as housing leaders fear federal cuts.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CHT_Apts_042825-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 18:07:23.906936

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A coalition of labor groups has cleared a major hurdle in an effort to repeal a controversial bill passed earlier this year that prohibits public unions from collective bargaining. 
The Protect Utah Workers coalition, in its bid to repeal HB267, satisfied two of the requirements to qualify for a ballot referendum on Monday. According to data from the lieutenant governor’s office, the coalition gathered signatures from at least 8% of the state’s registered voters — including signatures representing 8% of voters in at least 15 of Utah’s 29 state Senate districts. 
Per the lieutenant governor’s office, county clerks around the state have verified 146,480 signatures, above the roughly 141,000 threshold required to qualify for a referendum. 
Labor coalition shatters threshold to qualify for referendum in effort to repeal union bill

And data analyzed by political consulting and public affairs firm Morgan & May shows that the 8% threshold has also been met in 15 Senate districts. 
If those numbers hold up, it’s likely HB267 will be put on hold until the general election in November 2026, where voters will decide whether the controversial law should take effect. 
“Today, Utahns made history,” the coalition said in a statement on Monday, noting there are still “tens of thousands more signatures awaiting verification.” On April 16, the coalition announced it submitted 320,000 signatures gathered in the 30-day window required under Utah law — if accurate, it would be the most successful referendum effort in state history. 
“The message is clear: Utahns still believe in checks and balances, accountability, and the power of the people to lead,” the coalition said on Monday. 
According to Morgan & May, the coalition met the threshold in the following Senate districts: 

Republican Sen. John Johnson’s District 3, which includes North Ogden, Huntsville and parts of Summit County like Wanship and Coalville. 
Republican Sen. Ann Millner’s District 5, which includes Ogden, South Ogden, Riverdale, Sunset and Clearfield. 
Republican Sen. Jerry Stevenson’s District 6 in parts of Layton and Kaysville. 
Republican Senate President Stuart Adams’ District 7, which includes Layton down to Centerville.   
Republican Sen. Todd Weiler’s District 8, which encompasses North Salt Lake, Woods Cross, Bountiful and parts of Salt Lake City. 
Democrat Sen. Jen Plumb’s District 9 in Salt Lake City
Democrat Sen. Luz Escamilla’s District 10 in Salt Lake and West Valley cities. 
Democrat Sen. Karen Kwan’s District 12 in Kearns, West Valley City and parts of Taylorsville. 
Democrat Sen. Nate Blouin’s District 13, which includes parts of Salt Lake City, Millcreek, South Salt Lake and Murray. 
Democrat Sen. Stephanie Pitcher’s District 14 in Salt Lake City, Millcreek, Holladay and Murray. 
Democrat Sen. Kathleen Reibe’s District 15, which includes parts of Sandy, West Jordan and Cottonwood Heights. 
Republican Sen. Wayne Harper’s District 16 in Taylorsville and West Jordan. 
Republican Sen. Lincoln Fillmore’s District 17 in South Jordan. 
Republican Sen. Dan McCay’s District 18 in Herriman, Riverton and Bluffdale. 
Republican Sen. Kirk Cullimore’s District 19 in Sandy and Draper. 

“Many of the qualified districts are represented by the very politicians who actively pushed (and sponsored) HB 267,” the coalition said. “Now, their own neighborhoods are standing up for public workers’ rights.”

County clerks still have until the first week of May to verify outstanding signatures — once a signature is verified, it’s made public, opening a 45-day window where the voter can choose to rescind their support for the referendum, if they choose.
When the county clerks are done, the lieutenant governor’s office will then review the process. Assuming the coalition has complied with state code and gathered enough valid signatures, ballot language will be crafted for the 2026 general election. The law will be put on hold until then. 
HB267 was one of the most controversial bills to come out of the 2025 legislative session, prohibiting public sector unions from collective bargaining. Once it takes effect on July 1, 2025, a public union, like a teachers union, will no longer be able to negotiate an employment contract with an employer, like a school district. 
Lawmakers say HB267 will protect taxpayer dollars while giving all public employees a voice, not just union members. The bill’s sponsors — Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, and Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy — said unions shouldn’t be negotiating terms of employment if they don’t represent a majority of the employees. 
But labor groups and members of the public opposed the bill, speaking out during committee meetings, protesting in the Capitol rotunda and urging the governor to veto. Despite concerns that it would erode their rights and eliminate leverage unions have when meeting with their employers, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed it on Valentines Day.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado House of Representatives will not vote to override Gov. Jared Polis’ veto of a bipartisan bill to regulate users who illegally sell drugs and firearms on social media platforms.
The chamber voted 51-13 on Monday afternoon to lay over the override vote until May 9, which is after the legislative session ends. That means the veto will stand and the bill will not become law.
“We have accepted the fact that the governor has exercised his authority to veto this bill, that the Senate has exercised their constitutional authority to override that veto, and that today, the votes are not here in this chamber to do the same. That is a statement of fact,” bill sponsor Rep. Andrew Boesenecker, a Fort Collins Democrat, said.
He said he would bring the bill back in the future.

Senate Bill 25-86 aimed to protect vulnerable young people from predatory social media users who try to sexually exploit them online or sell them drugs or guns. It would have required social media companies, such as X and Meta, to investigate and remove users they determine violate policies around those behaviors. It also would have required companies to hand over related materials to law enforcement within three days of a request.
The bill originally passed the Senate on a 29-6 vote and the House on a 46-18. Polis, a Democrat, vetoed the bill last week, but the Senate voted to override the veto, which requires a two-thirds majority from both chambers. The House would have needed 43 votes to override.
If successful, it would have been the first override against a Polis veto.
“This law imposes sweeping requirements that social media platforms, rather than law enforcement, enforce state law,” Polis wrote in his veto letter. “It mandates a private company to investigate and impose the government’s chosen penalty of permanently deplatforming a user even if the underlying complaint is malicious and unwarranted. In our judicial proceedings, people receive due process when they are suspected of breaking the law. This bill, however, conscripts social media platforms to be judge and jury when users may have broken the law or even a company’s own content rules.”
Polis said he looks forward to working with lawmakers to achieve the bill’s goals, but he said “the approach set forth in SB25-086 risks undermining efforts to protect the right of free speech and dissent, and empowers social media companies with police-like powers to make or break someone’s lives and livelihood in a time when free expression is absolutely critical.”
Groups from across the political spectrum, including the ACLU, Working Families Party and Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, urged Polis to veto the bill, primarily on First Amendment concerns.
Bill supporters saw it as a way to protect children who use social media. If a person sold drugs to young people near their school, they would be punished, they argue, and social media is the modern equivalent of that scenario.
Polis also vetoed a bill that would set a different timeline for open records request responses for non-journalists. Sponsors have floated trying to override that veto as well, but the Senate delayed a vote on it until later this week. The legislative session ends May 7.

Chris Murphy takes his ’emergency’ message on the road,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/28/chris-murphy-ct-emergency-message/,"As other Democrats grasp to respond to Trump, CT Sen. Chris Murphy is channeling his own frustration and anger into a blitz of appearances.","SAXAPAHAW, N.C. (AP) — Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy isn’t drawing arena-size crowds like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are as he tours the country talking to voters. But in a packed concert hall in rural North Carolina, people are starting to view the Democrat as worthy of the national spotlight.
Murphy and Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., have been staging events in Republican congressional districts in recent weeks, trolling GOP lawmakers such as Rep. Richard Hudson, who represents the area they visited Thursday. Hudson, the chairman of the House GOP campaign arm, has discouraged Republicans from holding town halls, so Murphy and Frost decided to hold one on his home turf in North Carolina.
“We are doing the job that these Republican congressmen and senators won’t do,” Murphy told the hyped-up crowd of mostly older voters at the event, while acknowledging that Democrats need to do more to soothe their anxiety and counter President Donald Trump. “I want to make sure that everywhere, in every corner of this country, people are willing to stand up and fight.”
As other Democrats grasp for a response to Trump’s election, unsure of how to confront him, Murphy is channeling his own frustration and anger into a sustained blitz of television appearances, fundraising appeals, Senate floor speeches and events like the one in North Carolina. He also is talking directly to voters on social media, including through lengthy live videos on Instagram where he sits in his kitchen with a cocktail and tries to explain what he sees as “the central story” of Trump’s presidency — “the billionaire takeover of our government made possible by the destruction of our democracy.”

It’s a methodical approach for Murphy, 51, a serious-minded legislator who has been most well known for his yearslong fight to stem gun violence in the aftermath of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 20 first-grade students and six educators.

While the kitchen talks on Instagram seem to come more naturally to Murphy than riling up a crowd, his message is clearly resonating with his party’s base of voters, many of whom are angry at Democrats in Washington for inaction. He raised around $8 million in the first quarter of the year, a significant sum that could rival the totals for Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, who have been drawing much larger crowds on a tour together.
“I mean, I’m not Bernie Sanders,” Murphy said in an interview after the event in Saxapahaw. “I’m not going to draw 70,000 people. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t still have an obligation to try to go out and support a national mobilization.”
Frustration with the Democratic Party’s leaders came to a boil last month, with most of the anger directed at Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York after he voted for a Republican bill to keep the government open just as the base was hoping to see more fight from their elected officials. Murphy was strongly against the bill, even if opposing it meant Democrats would trigger a government shutdown.
“When people see us engaged in risk-adverse behavior, then they are much less likely to show up for rallies to ultimately engage in the kind of civil disobedience we might need to save the democracy,” Murphy said.

His fundraising haul, and his barrage of media and events, raises questions about his future ambitions. But it is unclear where Murphy’s moment might lead. He insists that he is not thinking about a presidential bid or a future in Senate leadership after the No. 2 Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, announced this week that he will retire next year.
“It’s probably not a coincidence that my content is breaking through and more people are listening to me at a time when I’m not getting up every day thinking about my personal political future,” said Murphy, who was reelected to the Senate last year. “There’s not going to be an election in 2028 if we don’t win this fight right now.”
The answer isn’t a cop out, he says. “It seems kind of silly to think about anything other than the emergency that exists today,” he said. “That is legitimately what drives me.”
Ron Osborne, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Alamance County, where Thursday’s event was located, said he had not previously considered Murphy a major contender for the presidency in 2028. But “he’s doing the right things,” Osborne said.
“He is speaking out where others could do the same thing and have not,” Osborne said, and “that takes courage.”
Terry Greenlund, a 78-year-old Democrat who was also in the audience, said he thinks Murphy “has a way of talking with people.”
“I think it’s time for a new generation to move in with some new views and insight and energy,” Greenlund said, echoing many others in the room.

A spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee said Hudson would not comment on the event in his central North Carolina district. The spokesman, Will Kiley, said Murphy had “parachuted in” and his “extreme, far-left values couldn’t be more out of step with these communities.”
Murphy, 51 and the father of two teenagers, seems to be enjoying the attention. He joked at the event that he may not be as “cool” as Frost, who is the youngest member of Congress at 28. But Murphy is still decades younger than Schumer, Durbin and other Democratic colleagues who have controlled the party for years.
“I’m trying to be dad cool,” Murphy said.
Murphy, who did a similar event in Missouri on Friday, is not the only Democrat venturing into red states. In addition to Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 vice presidential nominee, and Rep. Ro Khanna of California have also recently traveled to talk to voters in Republican areas.
He said he does not want to “reinvent the wheel” with his fundraising haul, but he does not want to sit on it, either. Murphy said he plans to help organizations mobilize voters before the 2026 midterm elections and also put pressure on Republicans as they try to push tax and spending cuts through Congress.
“The only way that history tells us that you stop an elected leader from converting a country away from democracy is mass mobilization,” he said.
“Our party has made mistakes, and if we don’t learn from those mistakes,” Murphy said, “we’re cooked.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Almost 100 days into his second term, President Donald Trump has seen his approval in South Carolina dip slightly, according to a Winthrop Poll released Monday. Still, favor for Trump in the state outperformed his ratings on the national stage.
The poll, published on the eve of his 100th day in office, found that 49.8% of people who had an opinion approved of Trump’s work thus far, a more than three percentage point drop since March.
Scott Huffmon, a political science professor at Winthrop and the poll’s director, told the SC Daily Gazette that the rapid slicing of the federal government, a slew of executive orders and tariffs increased Trump’s polarization, especially as some start feeling the direct impact of those decisions.
“We’re seeing more people get used to Trump the president and not Trump the candidate,” he said.
Whether or not respondents looked favorably upon the president’s performance to date tracked heavily along party lines.
Among self-identified Republicans, who made up roughly a third of all respondents, Trump’s approval rating sits at 80% — largely unchanged since March. Meanwhile, disfavor among self-identified Democrats, who made up a quarter of all respondents, grew four points to 85%.
The remaining 42% of all respondents identified as independent or declined to name a political affiliation.
(Voters don’t register by party in South Carolina, and the poll was not limited to likely voters.)
Tariff-induced trade war could spell double trouble for SC auto industry

Similarly, the Winthrop poll found that 47% of South Carolinians believe the country is on “the wrong track.” Eighty-one percent of Democrats hold that sentiment. Inversely, Republicans think the opposite, with 69% of respondents saying it is trending in the right direction.
“People’s opinions on the direction the country is headed depend heavily on whether their side holds power,” Huffmon said. “This is true at both the national and state level.”
More popular in the Palmetto State
Despite increased skepticism, Trump, who received more than 58% of the vote in November in South Carolina, remains more popular in the Palmetto State than he does nationwide.
A survey from Pew Research Center released on April 23 found the president’s national approval rating to be at 40%. Gallup has Trump at 44%, according to its most recent poll.
“South Carolina approval for President Trump among those with an opinion is notably higher than his national support but struggles to break into a clear majority,” Huffmon said.
On average, Trump’s approval rating sits at 44% as of Monday, according to a New York Times aggregation of numerous polls around the country. On Feb. 17, the president had an average approval of 50%.
In a Truth Social post Monday morning, Trump said not to believe the numbers. He specifically criticized a trio of polls, saying they should be investigated for election fraud.
He mentioned a joint survey done by ABC, The Washington Post and Ipsos, which concluded Trump had a 39% approval rating. He also railed against a New York Times-Siena Poll where 42% of respondents approved of him, as well as a Fox News survey that placed his favorability at 44%.
“They are Negative Criminals who apologize to their subscribers and readers after I WIN ELECTIONS BIG, much bigger than their polls showed I would win,” Trump wrote.
Graham lags among GOP
The Winthrop Poll also took South Carolinians’ temperature on other GOP politicians — notably U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is seeking his fifth term in the Senate in 2026.
At 44%, Graham’s approval rating among partisan Republicans who expressed an opinion was noticeably lower than two other statewide officials included in the poll — U.S. Sen. Tim Scott and Gov. Henry McMaster.
McMaster and Scott, the co-chairs for Graham’s 2026 re-election campaign, had a 58% and 56% approval rating among Republicans.
Graham has $15.9 million cash on hand, according to the latest FEC filings and already secured Trump’s endorsement for next year’s election.
“Senator Graham has a large campaign war chest and is not underwater approval-wise with his party,” Huffmon said. “This is a decent foundation upon which one could build a strong re-election campaign.

It looks like a mobile home park. The state says it isn’t. The folks in this Williston neighborhood are frustrated they can’t access the help that classification would afford them.

Sitting in his living room, the 78-year-old explained how much his community of manufactured homes means to him — and how frustrated he is with the state. Along the curved roads of Williston Woods Homeowners Association, most residents like Cook are seniors who get by on a fixed income. They can’t afford to make home improvements, Cook said. And some renos, like bathtub railings, are especially important for seniors, he said. Usually someone who lives in a manufactured or mobile home park can apply for state money to help pay for home-improvement projects. But Cook’s community, as a homeowners association, isn’t a mobile home park under Vermont law — so the state won’t list it on the registry that opens up those funds.Cook is one of 47 residents in the neighborhood, a designated affordable housing community for seniors. As a member of the association, he can afford a multi-bedroom house adorned with matte white siding — and, uniquely, ownership of the land it sits on.That’s why the state says the residents don’t face the same challenges, or need the same support, as people in traditional mobile home parks. Cook and his neighbors disagree. “The issue is that we’re not on the state registry — and it’s causing us a lot of grief,” Cook said. A note outlining grievances from Williston Woods Homeowners Association over its exclusion from the state registry for mobile home parks. Photo by Catherine MorrisseyAssociation leaders have been pressuring the state for years to recognize their community. After talks this spring, Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, wrote to the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, which manages the registry. She asked them for an exception and never heard back. “They are the only mobile home community that’s come forward in the state where they own their homes, they own the land underneath them and they own the park collectively,” Ram Hinsdale said. The agency told Community News Service that state assistance is meant to help people more vulnerable than the residents. Officials don’t plan on recognizing the park under current laws but said they will continue to work with residents on other ways to help them. The state offers grants for making repairs, installing foundations, hauling away abandoned homes and more. The manufactured home program has paid over $6 million in awards, the agency says.READ MORE





 


Vermont is pouring millions into manufactured homes and mobile home parks

To fit the state’s definition, at least two mobile homes have to sit on a piece of land owned by one owner. Right next door to Williston Woods Homeowners Association lives Williston Woods Cooperative Housing Corporation, a manufactured home co-op that functions almost exactly the same as the homeowners association. But the co-op itself owns the whole park, while the association parcels land out for individual ownership. And the distinction earns the co-op a spot on the registry. Most of the homes in Cook’s community were built in the 1980s, he said, and manufactured homes need more weatherization and frequent maintenance than traditional homes. Many people in the community can’t afford the repairs, said Cook, and getting maintenance done is often harder for older folks. Joe Yandow, a 73-year-old who joined the community a few years ago, said his house needed major improvements when he moved in. An older woman with mobility issues owned the house before him, and she just couldn’t keep up with the repairs, Yandow said. Gary Nowak, a leader and resident of the association, in discussion in April 2025. Photo by Catherine MorrisseyHe said he had to renovate parts of the house and was denied funding at every step. Now he has a leak in the roof and needs the insulation in his attic replaced — but he’s not sure how to afford it.“The state’s going to have to step up,” Yandow said, speaking for himself and his neighbors.  Cook said recently a number of residents helped a woman walk up the stairs outside her home. She should be able to build a ramp or install a stairlift device without having to cover the cost, Cook said. Legislators tried to tackle the issue last year by proposing a bill to expand the definition of a manufactured home park. But officials at the Agency of Commerce and Community Development voiced concerns that a definition change would open the door for people who didn’t need the assistance. The bill was never passed. One of the main streets in Williston Woods Homeowners Association. Photo by Catherine MorrisseyThis February, Cook and another community leader, Gary Nowak, told a Senate committee about their frustrations. The men stayed in contact with their senator, Ram Hinsdale, and asked her again to take action. She wrote the agency requesting to make an exception on the registry for the homeowners association but got no reply, she said. The agency “legally cannot make an exception for Williston Woods as it does not meet the definition of a mobile home park,” said Scott Sharland, mobile home park coordinator for the agency’s housing department.The state has programs to assist those in manufactured homes because they “do not own their land, which makes them particularly vulnerable to increases in lot rents and the possibility of evictions, park sales or park closures,” Sharland said, speaking on behalf of the department.But residents at the homeowners association in Williston say they’re in need, too. “Just add us to the damn registry,” Yandow said. The agency wants to find “the best way to accommodate” the homeowners association, Sharland said, “without undermining the purpose of the mobile home park registry.” So far, it hasn’t.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Frustration stews at Williston senior community over state’s mobile home park rules.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Morrissey_Mobile_Home-6.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

Supreme Court hears state’s plea to unblock clergy abuse probe,Dana DiFilippo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/04/28/n-j-supreme-court-hears-states-plea-to-unblock-clergy-abuse-probe/,The New Jersey Supreme Court will decide if state grand juries can issue presentments on clergy abuse or if presentments don't apply to private entities.,"Attorney Lloyd D. Levenson, who represents the Diocese of Camden, listens to arguments before the New Jersey Supreme Court about clergy sex abuse on April 28, 2025, at the Richard J. Hughes Justice Complex in Trenton. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey Supreme Court heard arguments Monday in a long-fought case about whether a state grand jury can call out a private entity like the Catholic Church and recommend reforms for its public harms, like clergy sex abuse — or if such presentments are permissible only when they involve public entities and ongoing harms, as church attorneys contend.
The Catholic Diocese of Camden has been battling the state to prevent a presentment since 2019, when former Attorney General Gurbir Grewal vowed to investigate clergy sex abuse. He acted after a Pennsylvania grand jury returned a presentment against hundreds of priests who victimized more than 1,000 children over seven decades
Lower-court judges sided with the diocese and sealed the New Jersey case, so while the legal fight has continued for six years in secrecy, abuse victims were left wondering what happened to Grewal’s investigation. The Attorney General’s Office appealed to the Supreme Court for the final word, and the state’s top court agreed last month to consider the case and ordered some records unsealed.

Monday, Michael L. Zuckerman, the state’s deputy solicitor general, told the justices that trial and appellate judges erred by taking a “front-end, stop-the-presses approach” in preventing prosecutors from even taking the case to a grand jury and ruling on a presentment that does not yet exist.
“My frontline argument to you is that it is highly premature, inconsistent with the rule, for the trial court to have short-circuited this process before it could even start,” Zuckerman said. “And so for that reason, this court should simply reverse and remand for the process to go forward, possibly clarifying along the way that presentments can sometimes talk about non-governmental actors too.”
Any concerns about outing private individuals could be handled after a presentment is returned and before it is publicly disclosed, with a judge redacting or striking whatever they find concerning, Zuckerman added.
But attorney Lloyd D. Levenson, arguing for the Camden diocese, said clergy abuse was “long-ago conduct by private individuals that impacted only a fragment of the population.” Presentments must address “imminent” harms against a broad swath of the public perpetrated by public actors, such as government entities or public officials, so the lower courts were correct to thwart a presentment, Levenson added.
“If this court expands the scope of a grand jury presentment to include private individuals and private entities, conducting investigations in secret under the sole influence of a prosecutor with no opportunity to present a defense, the grand jury’s authority will be unlimited,” Levenson said. “Presentments were never intended to call attention to private conduct within private entities. We ask, respectfully, that this court affirm.”
He dismissed Zuckerman’s claim that barring a hypothetical presentment is premature.
“You’d have to be Rip Van Winkle to not realize what is going to come out of this,” he said. “I can tell you what’s going to come out of it: They’re going to say that from 1940 to the present, because that’s what the subpoena included, that there was problems in the Catholic Church with child sexual abuse.”
Abuse victims already have multiple avenues for justice — prosecutors can seek criminal indictments, and victims can sue for civil damages, Levenson said. He also cited a 2002 agreement between the state and New Jersey’s dioceses that required them to report all abuse allegations to public authorities. The state had five years to raise concerns about that agreement — but didn’t, proving that church has effectively “eradicated” the problem of sex abuse from its clerical ranks, he said.
Levenson also accused the state of “partisan” motives, questioning why prosecutors singled out the Catholic Church for investigation instead of other religious or private groups. He warned the justices that allowing the grand jury to weigh private entities’ conduct is “a slippery slope.”
“Where do you end this? Is the local rotary club, because it doesn’t admit women or minorities, subject to a presentment?” he said.
Several justices appeared unpersuaded by Levenson’s arguments.

“If the presentment does not exist, it’s hard to know if it’s based on partisan motives,” Justice Rachel Wainer Apter told him.
A presentment might not even have been returned had a grand jury heard the case, Justice Fabiana Pierre-Louis added.
“It’s really difficult to speculate as to what a presentment — if 12 grand jurors even vote on a presentment — will look like, and trying to determine how to assess something that has not yet come into existence,” Pierre-Louis said.
The justices also mused over what counts as “public affairs or conditions,” which presentments are meant to address. Court rules and precedents don’t specify that “every single member of the public” must be impacted for a harm to rise to the level of a public affair or condition, Wainer Apter said.
Chief Justice Stuart Rabner prodded Levenson about his complaint that Grewal announced his intention to secure a presentment in 2019, instead of just presenting the case to the grand jury without any public notice.
“Would we be here if the state had simply first started summoning victims to testify?” Rabner asked him.
State prosecutors have asked for an expedited review, with the Supreme Court expected to recess for the summer in June until October.
 Victims react
Several clergy abuse victims watched the arguments from the packed gallery. Outside the courtroom afterward, many were cautiously optimistic about how the court will rule.
“I am hopeful. That’s the best I could say,” said Toni Latario of Alpha.
Latario said she was 11 when she first met her abuser, a Catholic missionary. Now 66, she’s a retired sergeant from the Warren County Prosecutor’s Office, where she ran the special-victims unit. She went public with her childhood abuse as an adult because she was concerned her abuser might have preyed on other children too, she said.
Kathy Leddy-Callahan of Bergen County, who said she was abused as a child, objected to shielding the names of abusive priests and any church leaders who hushed up abuse. Anyone else credibly accused, charged, or convicted of abuse would be publicly named, she added.
“Absolutely, the name should be revealed. Without question. That notion of a heavenly umbrella that protects is absurd, and it also attracts people who do that,” Leddy-Callahan said.

Mark Crawford, the New Jersey state director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, condemned the Camden diocese’s secrecy.
“They’re out there standing on that podium saying: ‘We’ve done all this for victims, we’ve put the truth out there, there’s nothing hidden.’ Then why is it they have worked so hard to suppress this investigation?” Crawford said.
He also disputed Levenson’s claim that clergy abuse no longer is a problem.
“That’s just not true. It’s accepted science that children who are abused don’t generally come forward for decades, if ever. So how can you say in the present, ‘Oh, nothing’s going on?’” Crawford said. “The whole truth has not been told, and that’s why it takes society and a grand jury investigation to one, expose what they still have hidden, and two, to help those victims who were abused heal.”

The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services will participate in the SUN Bucks program again this summer, although Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration was at first reluctant to do so a year ago. The state agency is proactively telling families about the program, though it says nearly all participants are already signed up to receive the one-time benefit of $120.
“Most eligible children will be automatically enrolled and do not need to apply,” Sammy Guillory, DCFS assistant secretary for family support, said in a statement.
The summer benefits will be added to SNAP recipients’ EBT cards or the SUN Bucks card they were issued last summer. The money is available to use for 122 days after it is issued. It will be doled out starting in the second half of May for children already enrolled in the program. 
To be eligible, children must be born between Aug. 8, 2006, and July 1, 2028 and have received income-based food, financial or Medicaid support since July 1, 2024. The threshold for families to receive the assistance is a household income below 185% of the federal poverty level, which comes to $59,477 for a family of four.
Families who no longer have EBT or SUN Bucks cards should call 1-888-997-1117 or visit www.LifeInCheckEBT.com to request a replacement. Families who need to apply for SUN Bucks can do so online.
SUN Bucks evolved from a federal COVID pandemic food aid program that the Biden administration chose to keep in place in 2024. But when states were asked in late 2023 whether they would continue to participate the following summer, Louisiana Education Superintendent Cade Brumley opted out. His department determines eligibility for the program that DCFS administers.
Brumley explained at the time he thought it wasn’t fair to approve a program the incoming Landry administration would have to shoulder without any say-so.
Shortly after his appointment in early 2024, Landry’s DCFS secretary, David Matlock, also said his agency wouldn’t offer the Summer EBT program because “families deserve a pathway to self-sufficiency.” He insisted existing programs would cover food needs over the summer, although critics said many families lacked transportation to pick up the “grab-and-go” prepared meals Matlock was promoting.
The secretary later told state lawmakers his priority for any public resources would be addressing staff shortages within his department affecting child welfare.
The Landry administration ultimately caved under pressure from Republican lawmakers who noted for every $1 Louisiana spent to administer the summer food program, the state received $1.60 in federal funds. All told, the state stood to miss out on $70 million from Washington.
Louisiana was the second poorest state in the nation with a poverty rate of 18.9% in 2023, the most recent data available from the Census Bureau.  
Last year, nearly 670,000 Louisiana children received SUN Bucks benefits, and almost 100% were automatically enrolled, according to Guillory. Families who have changed their home address are encouraged to update their records with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and other assistance programs to avoid delays with receiving food assistance this summer.
In 2023, incorrect addresses prevented more than 124,000 children in Louisiana from receiving pandemic food assistance. Several states reported similar problems, but Louisiana was too slow to rectify the issue and lost $16 million in federal aid as a result.

A Tallahassee administrative judge on Monday recommended the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) deny a permit to drill for oil and gas in the Apalachicola River Basin in Northwest Florida.
Administrative Law Judge Lawrence P. Stevenson wrote that he might have ruled differently had Clearwater Land and Minerals LLC, the company intending to drill, presented a better plan for stormwater containment on the site, located in rural Calhoun County.
On April 26, 2024, the DEP issued the proposed permit to Clearwater, authorizing the company “to drill a directional exploratory well.” That permit was challenged in June 2024 by Apalachicola Riverkeeper, a nonprofit dedicated to the protection, restoration, and stewardship of the Apalachicola River and Apalachicola Bay.
The drilling site is within the 100-year floodplain of the Apalachicola River basin.
Riverkeeper has said that that if a spill were to occur at the site, it would have catastrophic consequences due to the proximity of the proposed well to the nearby streams, wetlands, and bodies of water, which would compound the difficulty of cleaning up the spill.
In testimony during an administrative hearing held in December, William K. Jones, described by the judge as an expert in the field of civil engineering and hydrology, was critical of the stormwater management design proposed by Clearwater. He described it as adequate for “a Dollar General in Blountstown,” but not to contain the toxic materials involved in the oil drilling process. (Blounstown is the Calhoun County seat).
“Mr. Jones’s detailed criticisms, set forth in the Findings of Fact above, established persuasively that the stormwater management plan originally proposed was inadequate,” Judge Stevenson wrote.
The judge also was critical of the DEP’s contention that, “because no commenting agency identified it as such, the proposed location by definition cannot be a ‘sensitive environment.'”
“First, DEP is abdicating its own duty to identify and protect sensitive environments by relying on what were, for the most part, very cursory reviews by the commenting agencies,” Judge Stevenson wrote.
“The more reasonable way to read the rule is that it allows commenting agencies to supplement DEP’s analysis, not replace it or absolve DEP from examining environmental issues. If DEP has previously found that an area contains a sensitive environment, it makes no sense that the rule would allow the Calhoun Board of County Commissioners to negate DEP’s finding.”
The order comes as the Florida Legislature was moving on a proposal (HB 1143) to ban oil exploration and drilling near the Apalachicola River. Last week, the Florida Senate took up and passed the House version with an amendment prohibiting drilling, exploration, or production of oil, gas, or other petroleum products in counties designated as “rural areas of opportunity” within 10 miles of a National Estuarine Research Reserve — meaning Gulf, Liberty, Franklin, and Calhoun counties.
Deepwater Horizon
In advocating for the bill, the co-sponsor of the measure in the House, North Florida Republican Jason Shoaf, noted the recent 15th anniversary of of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, an event that led to miles of oiled beaches in the Florida Panhandle.
“During the oil spill, just the threat of oil coming to our area completely crippled our economy and now we face another threat that is starting to really scare the entire community,” Shoaf said.
Because the bill was amended, it needs to go back to the House again for a final vote. The regular legislative session is scheduled to end this Friday, May 2. If the bill is passed, it would then go to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ desk.
Stevenson’s recommended order released on Monday now must go back to the Department of Environmental Protection for a final order.
Administrative judges in Florida are employed by the Division of Administrative Hearings (DOAH) within the Florida Department of Management Services. They serve as independent adjudicators, presiding over formal administrative hearings, where they act as both judge and jury to resolve disputes between state agencies and individuals or entities affected by agency decision.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Landmark College selects interim leader as new president.","Newly appointed president of Landmark College, Jim Dlugos. Photos courtesy of Landmark College.Jim Dlugos has been appointed the fifth president of the Putney-based Landmark College, the first college in the nation specifically designed to serve neurodiverse students, the college announced on Monday. Dlugos was named interim president of Landmark College in July, after a decades-long career in postsecondary education, including an 11-year role as president of St. Joseph’s College in Maine. Dlugos said he welcomed the opportunity to help Landmark College during a transition period and now in a permanent capacity because the mission of the college aligned with his individualized, learner-centered approach to education.Barbara Epifanio, the chair of Landmark College’s board of trustees, said in a written statement that the board realized during the search process that Dlugos had the “right vision and demeanor” for the position. “As we’ve gotten to know Jim as Interim President, and he’s gotten to know us, we came to realize there was an ideal fit for his experiences and the opportunities our institution presents,” Epifanio wrote. Landmark College, founded in 1985, offers six bachelor degree programs and five associate degree programs and serves approximately 500 students with dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism or executive function challenges.With Dlugos at the helm for most of the past year, the college moved forward on several initiatives, such as adding three majors in history, health sciences and media arts production next fall, he said. “At a time when most news from colleges and universities is about closing programs or shutting programs down, the fact that Landmark is adding programs is a really positive sign about our future,” Dlugos said. In January, Landmark College was named the primary recipient of a federal National Science Foundation grant geared toward bolstering educational and professional opportunities in science, technology, engineering and math in the southern Vermont region. Dlugos said the grant is moving forward, and the college is in the hiring and strategic planning phase of implementing projects made possible by the grant. READ MORE
“It’ll allow us to develop infrastructure for research, and research is the backbone of emerging businesses,” Dlugos said. “It’s really about economic development and strengthening the economy in southern Vermont, and so it’s going to end up with tremendous benefits for everyone who lives in southern Vermont.”Josh Moyse, associate professor of theater arts and the faculty senate chair, called Dlugos a “visionary and creative thinker” who engages in a holistic way with faculty to help steward the institution. The college was originally established as a certificate and tutoring program and began offering four-year degrees more than a decade ago, he said. “Our student profile has continued to evolve over these decades, and what that means is that we are often transitioning to new territory from within,” Moyse said. “Jim brings a wealth of experience in higher ed that is beyond Landmark and is able to see certain areas that we can simplify that may have become a little bit more cumbersome, which allows us to be more nimble as we move forward.”Grace Nelson, the president of the Student Government Association, said Dlugos has maintained an open dialogue with students and considered student perspectives during his stint as interim president and that she is grateful that Dlugos will remain the leader of Landmark College.“He’s done a lot of things that have improved some of my experiences with the school,” Nelson said. “With certain meetings, he’s changed some of the formats to make it more of an open conversation.”Nelson also pointed to weekly emails Dlugos sends out about national affairs and the potential impacts for Landmark to engage students, faculty and staff. “It’s more easily accessible for us and puts it in context,” she said.Last fall, the college acquired the defunct Windham College’s former gymnasium and field house building and is beginning renovations to transform the space into a “college community hub,” according to Dlugos.“Part of my hope for Landmark over the next number of years is that we become clear in our advocacy, developing neuro-inclusive communities, and part of that is having neuro-inclusive spaces,” Dlugos said. “The renovations really are going to be aimed at creating spaces that are going to be the best possible for people to learn differently, and the reality is we all learn differently.” Along with creating inclusive learning and gathering areas, Dlugos said one of his goals as president is to develop a strategic plan in the coming year to foster ongoing engagement with the school’s neighbors and the broader community.“We’re looking to really develop and strengthen our relationships with Putney and with the rest of Windham County,” Dlugos said. “I really want Landmark College to be seen as an anchor institution in Windham County, and so it’s important that we plan for the future, that we know what is important and on the mind of everyone in the area.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Landmark College selects interim leader as new president.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/landmark-college-composite.png?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith’s defense of the Three-Fifths Compromise — which he called “a great move” by the country’s founders toward ending slavery — has thrust the Republican official into the national spotlight and triggered sharp pushback from historians and civil rights groups.
The statement was made in a Thursday video posted to X in which Beckwith argued that the 18th century-era compromise limited the political power of pro-slavery states by not allowing them to count enslaved individuals as whole persons for congressional representation. 
The video, shared on the last day of Indiana’s 2025 legislative session, was a response to Statehouse debate around Senate Enrolled Act 289. The heart of that measure, authored by Republican Sen. Gary Byrne, limits diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools, state government and health profession licensing. The bill advanced to the governor on Thursday but has not been signed.
Beckwith took aim at Senate Democrats, specifically, for likening the bill to historical policies — like the Three-Fifths Compromise — that “dehumanized” marginalized groups. Sen. La Keisha Jackson, D-Indianapolis, who invoked the compromise and its history during her chamber testimony, called the Republican-backed legislation “a fight against racial equality.”
 Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith explains in his stance in defense of the Three-Fifths Compromise in a social media video posted Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Screenshot from a video posted to the lieutenant governor’s official X account)
“They were saying this is a bad bill because it actually just encourages discrimination, just like the Three-Fifths Compromise, going all the way back to the foundations of our nation,” Beckwith said. “I would like to share with you, the Three-Fifths Compromise is not a pro-discrimination compromise. It was not a pro-discrimination or a slave-driving compromise that the founders made. It was actually just the opposite. It was a compromise that the North made with the South.”
Beckwith’s official X account also doesn’t allow users to reply to the post.
Critics have since accused Beckwith of rewriting history and downplaying the horrors of slavery. 
In a joint statement issued by the Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis, the Indiana Chapter of the National Action Network and the Alliance of Baptists, the groups labeled Beckwith’s interpretation as “historical revisionism” and called for a formal retraction. They emphasized that the compromise was about consolidating control and political power while denying enslaved individuals their humanity and rights.
The groups further urged Gov. Mike Braun to publicly denounce the comments, but the Republican governor has yet to comment on the matter.
The pushback was highlighted in news stories by The Washington Post, Fox News, Newsweek and other major outlets.
Also on Monday, the Indiana Senate Democratic caucus released a statement denouncing Beckwith’s comments.
“No compromise that counted human beings as fractions can ever be anything but a stain on our nation’s conscience,” it said. “The Three-Fifths Compromise entrenched the enslavement of people, empowered oppression and delayed justice by generations.”










The argument that the Three-Fifths Compromise was actually passed with the intention of destroying or undermining slavery is just, frankly, laughable.


– Indiana University history professor Alex Lichtenstein


Neither Beckwith nor his office have released an official statement about his remarks on the Three-Fifths Compromise, but the lieutenant governor continued to defend his position in the days following the video’s posting.
Alex Lichtenstein, a history professor at Indiana University, described Beckwith’s retelling of history as “a confusion between intention and long-term consequences.”
“The intention of the compromise was, quite frankly, to sell out Black people. That is to lock them into slavery for longer term in the interest of creating the union,” Lichtenstein said. “The argument that the Three-Fifths Compromise was actually passed with the intention of destroying or undermining slavery is just, frankly, laughable.”
In 1787, during the Constitutional Convention, the nation’s founders included “multiple concessions” in the U.S. Constitution to Southern states, “designed to preserve and protect the institution of slavery,” Lichtenstein said.
The most significant was the Three-Fifths Compromise, which allowed Southern states to count three-fifths of their enslaved population for congressional representation — effectively giving them more political power and preventing the union from easily abolishing slavery.
The history professor described Beckwith’s comments and the ensuing debate as “a much broader assault in the country, but particularly in this state,” on universities like IU, and on faculty’s ability “to recognize and teach a complex American history story.”
“They’d much rather have a simple, straightforward story. ‘Oh yeah, the founders were perfect. They might have held slaves, but fundamentally, they were themselves opposed to slavery, and in their infinite wisdom, they built in these clauses that they knew could be used to defeat slavery in the long-term.’ Apparently they just didn’t really tell anyone, nor did they count on a civil war to have to make it happen,” he continued. “They want a particular form of history which makes them feel comfortable, but unfortunately for them, it’s wildly inaccurate.”
‘Rewriting’ the nation’s history
In the video posted on the lieutenant governor’s official X account, Beckwith admonished Senate Democrats for saying on the chamber floor that Byrne’s bill “embodies something to the effect of the Three-Fifths Compromise.”
His remarks continued into a history lesson, of sorts:
“At the time, there were basically 13 independent nations. They had not really created a constitution. They were sort of a European Union-esque nation, and they were saying to the pro-slave states, ‘Hey, if you want to count your slaves to have representation — more representation — in Congress, we’re not gonna let you do that,’ because they knew that that would codify things like slavery into our nation. 
And the North stood up to the South, and they said, ‘We’re going to count your property,’ because the South says, ‘Hey, this is our property, but we want to count them in the congressional representation. We want to count them in the census.’ At the time, 30,000 people would equal one member of Congress. And so they said, ‘We’re going to count our slaves. We’re going to get more members of Congress in the South.’ The North said, ‘You can’t do that.’ So when they came back to the South and they said, ‘Fine, if you want to count your property, your slaves, as whole people, we’re going to count our property. We’re going to count our tables, we’re going to count our chairs, we’re going to count all the stuff that we have in our house.’ And the South said, ‘Well, you can’t do that.’ And they said, ‘Well, you’re doing it with your property. We’re doing it with our property.’
Anti-DEI bill cracking down on ‘unlawful discrimination’ en route to governor’s desk

So what they did is they came up with a Three-Fifths Compromise. They said you will only get three-fifths of a vote when it comes to your slave. And what that did, it actually limited the number of pro-slave representatives in Congress by 40%. This was a great move by the North to make sure that slavery would be eradicated in our nation. They knew what they were doing, but now, here you have Senate Democrats in today’s American Republic who do not understand that.”
Beckwith’s take on the compromise’s history appear to echo interpretations by David Barton, an author and political activist revered in evangelical circles for promoting the idea that the United States was founded as a Christian nation. His interpretations of U.S. history have been met with significant criticism from many historians and scholars, however, who argue that Barton’s work contains inaccuracies and misrepresentations and proliferates the spread of “pseudo-history.”
Follow-up posts on Beckwith’s personal X account included a 2010 interview clip from Glenn Beck’s Fox News show, during which Barton described the Three-Fifths Compromise as a means to “cut the slavery representation in Congress in half.”
“When Frederick Douglass read that, he said, ‘The Three-Fifths Clause has nothing to do with worth. That has to do with representation. It makes it harder to get a pro-slavery representative in Congress. The Constitution’s an antislavery document,’ Barton said. “It was Frederick Douglass who points that out.”
Beckwith agreed with Barton, saying on X that “the great abolitionist, Fredrick Douglass, recognized the strategic value it gave our new nation in ultimately ending the evils of slavery and racial discrimination.”
He reiterated that “(w)ithout the 3/5ths Compromise there would be no United States” and “slavery would likely still be a normal part of the developed world.”
“It was a great step in the right direction which ultimately laid the foundation for the eradication of the evils of slavery and racial discrimination,” he said in on the social media site.
Intent vs. consequences
Lichtenstein said Douglass initially aligned with radical abolitionists who viewed the Constitution as “entirely pro-slavery.” In the 1840s, abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison, for example, “wanted to burn the Constitution and saw it as a “compact with the devil.”
But by the 1850s, Douglass shifted his stance. He began to see the Constitution as a potential tool to challenge slavery and recognized that the Three-Fifths Compromise “could be strategically used to undermine the institution of slavery,” turning a clause originally designed to protect slavery into a potential weapon against it.

Importantly, Lichtenstein emphasized, Douglass’s approach was “tactical” — not a wholesale endorsement of the original intent of the compromise.
Additionally, the abolitionist never denied the the Three-Fifths Compromise was initially passed to benefit Southern slave-holding states. Instead, Douglass strategically reinterpreted the clause to advance abolitionist goals.
“Frederick Douglass was the most woke person you can imagine in the 1850s,” Lichtenstein said. “These folks who heroicize Frederick Douglass either are being disingenuous or don’t know what they’re talking about.”
The professor made clear, as well, that there is “no disagreement” among historians and academics about the original intent of the Three-Fifths Compromise.
There were other pro-slavery provisions, too, like the Slave Trade Clause, which prohibited Congress from ending the slave trade until 1808.
“That meant there were 20 more years to bring in as many slaves from Africa as you like, which amounted to over one-third of the total slave imports to the colony (and later the United States) over the entire period of the slave trade,” Lichtenstein said.
Separately, the Fugitive Slave Clause required the return of escaped enslaved people to their owners.
“These were deal breakers for the South. They weren’t deal breakers for the North,” Lichtenstein noted.
Historians suggest that without these compromises, slavery might have been constitutionally abolished as early as the 1820s. The concessions were so effective at strengthening slavery that they ultimately emboldened the South to secede and go to war in 1861.
That framing of past events is “universally understood” among historians, Lichtenstein said, although there continues to be “vigorous discussion” about whether the Constitution could ultimately be considered an anti-slavery document, and about how abolitionists like Frederick Douglass strategically reinterpreted constitutional clauses.

Historians like Sean Wilentz contend that the Three-Fifths Compromise, while morally flawed, was a necessary limitation on slaveholder power and helped leave open a path toward slavery’s eventual abolition.
Other historians, including, Nicholas Guyatt, argue instead that the compromise strengthened slavery’s hold on national politics from the start and was not a tactical anti-slavery measure, but a structural embedding of racial injustice into the Constitution.
“What I find so ironic or peculiar about this is that the the extreme right-wing is always insistent on original intent of the Constitution. … But here, all of a sudden, when it comes to the three-fifths clause, they don’t seem to care about the original intent. For this, it’s the living document and how it was put to use later on,” Lichtenstein said. “You can’t have it both ways. If you believe in original intent, then you have to believe that the Three-Fifths Compromise was a concession to slavery in the Southern states.”
“We don’t glorify the founders because they had the magical crystal ball to realize that the Three-Fifths Compromise was going to be anti-slavery. No, they made a flawed compromise with the institution of slavery,” he added. “But we are fortunate enough that people came later on to recognize that that tool could be used for justice instead of injustice.”

(Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)A proposal to more than double the tax placed on sports gambling in Louisiana – and dedicate some of that revenue to Division I athletics programs – is moving forward in the state legislature.
The House Appropriations Committee voted Monday to advance House Bill 639 by Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, to increase the tax on sports gambling from 15% to 32.5%. The higher rate aligns with the tax the state places on video poker. 
The proposed increase in sports gambling taxes has support from conservative and progressive corners, both saying the revenue should be used to offset the “social ills” of gambling. The new rate would generate another $2 million for addiction programs.
But Riser’s bill goes further, altering the tax revenue split and putting 25% into a Supporting Programs, Opportunities, Resources and Teams (SPORT) fund that would benefit student-athletes at Louisiana’s public universities that compete at the NCAA Division I level. They include UL Lafayette, UL Monroe, Louisiana Tech, LSU, Grambling, McNeese, Nicholls, Northwestern, Southeastern, Southern and the University of New Orleans. 
The committee also tied Riser’s legislation to House Bill 594 by Rep. Chance Henry, R-Crowley, which creates a flat tax on insurance premiums. Riser’s bill can only take effect if Henry’s does. 
Rep. Jerome “Zee” Zeringue, R-Houma, was the only lawmaker on the committee to vote against Riser’s bill, saying he was concerned about the potential budget impact of Henry’s bill. Precise details of the bundled bills’ fiscal impact will be made clear in the next version of the fiscal note, which should be made publicly available before Riser’s bill is debated on the House floor.

Sports gambling companies opposed Riser’s bill, arguing that Louisiana’s 15% tax rate is already higher than the 14% national average. Lawmakers were skeptical of this concern, noting the companies are based out of state and have no physical infrastructure or employees in Louisiana, unlike the casinos here that pay the much higher tax rate of 32.5%.
Riser’s bill has wide support from college athletics department leaders, who packed the committee room at the State Capitol. 
“The need is so high,” Riser said in an interview with the Louisiana Illuminator and Tiger Rag. “When you start talking about the SEC, talking about any level of athletics right now, it’s changed so dramatically.” 
“Even like ULM … just to be competitive [in recruiting], it takes facilities, when you’re dealing with [athletes] they require you to have all those things,” Riser said. 
Riser’s bill was amended to equally split revenue in the SPORT fund among eligible institutions. 
The fund is expected to receive more than $31 million in dedicated funding annually, according to a fiscal note for the bill. Each school would receive approximately $2.8 million annually. 
That’s a small drop in the bucket for LSU, which has an athletics budget of over $200 million. But it would be a significant lifeline for schools such as Southern, Nicholls and ULM, which each spend less than $20 million a year on their sports program. 
Presently, the state’s split for sports gambling tax revenue calls for 25% to go toward early childhood education, 10% to local governments, 3% to gambling addiction programs, and the rest to other priorities and the state general fund. 
Under Riser’s bill, childhood education, local governments and addiction recovery would retain their existing share of tax proceeds. In addition to the 25% that would now go to college athletics, another 3% would be dedicated to the Louisiana Postsecondary Inclusive Education Fund to finance programs for students with disabilities. The rest goes into the state general fund for a variety of government needs.

Stirling is now taking on a new role and was officially sworn in as acting U.S. attorney. (File photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The state’s prisons director was officially sworn in as acting U.S. attorney Monday.
With Bryan Stirling tapped as the state’s lead federal prosecutor, his deputy director of operations, Joel Anderson, will take over leadership of the state’s 21 prisons, according to a news release from the governor’s office.
Stirling started working as head of the Department of Corrections in 2013. That job, which involved overseeing more than 3,700 employees and a prison system with more than 16,000 inmates, was “the privilege of a lifetime,” Stirling said in a statement.
SC prisons director to become interim U.S. attorney

“I look forward to continuing to serve the people of South Carolina and pledge to uphold the high standards set by those who came before me,” Stirling said.
Stirling’s appointment by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi means a formal nomination from President Donald Trump is likely. Stirling will then need confirmation by the U.S. Senate to officially become the state’s top federal prosecutor. Bondi’s appointment means Stirling will oversee 120 prosecutors and about 20 support staff on an interim basis as he awaits confirmation.
Trump’s administration removed Adair Ford Boroughs, the state’s U.S. attorney since 2022, in February. Boroughs’ assistant attorney Brooks Andrews has filled the role since.
As corrections director, Stirling cracked down on contraband coming into prisons, including a push to change federal law that would legalize signal blocking technology to make inmates’ illegal cellphones useless. He implemented personal development programs for inmates that led to the state having one of the lowest rates in the country of inmates re-offending and returning to prison. And he successfully pushed for higher employee salaries in an effort to recruit and retain correctional officers.
Stirling also guided the department through a 2018 prison riot that left seven inmates dead and the restarting of executions after 13 years, including the first conducted by firing squad in state history.
“Director Bryan Stirling is widely recognized as the best corrections director in the country, and his relentless spirit has turned SCDC into a model for other states to follow,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a news release.

Before becoming director of the state’s prison system, Stirling was then-Gov. Nikki Haley’s chief of staff. Prior to that, he was deputy attorney general during McMaster’s two terms as the state’s head prosecutor.
Stirling’s name was among those floated for the position during Trump’s first term, though Trump eventually nominated Columbia attorney Sherri Lydon instead. Two years later, after Lydon’s departure, Peter McCoy led the agency for eight months before stepping down after former President Joe Biden took office.
Anderson, who will act as interim head of the prison system, has overseen security, maintenance and food service for the corrections department since 2019.
Originally from Texas, the 66-year-old started working in prisons in 1978 as a correctional officer for the state of Texas. He rose through the ranks, becoming a major by the time he left in 1996, according to his agency bio.
Anderson came to South Carolina that year to lead the state’s inmate work programs and prison food service. After a brief stint working for Florida’s prison system, Anderson returned to the South Carolina Department of Corrections in 2004, where he worked as a prison warden and in several other leadership roles.
“It is my honor to leave the South Carolina Department of Corrections in the very capable hands of Joel Anderson,” Stirling said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_6871-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) State officials are curious about how Rhode Islanders are using artificial intelligence (AI).
The Rhode Island Artificial Intelligence Task Force and Gov. Dan McKee launched a new survey Friday asking Rhode Islanders how they feel about AI and how they’re using it. The survey is open through May 9 and takes about 10 minutes to complete, but can take longer depending on the length of one’s responses to write-in questions.
“We’re positioning Rhode Island as a national leader in AI, cybersecurity, and other emerging technologies,” McKee said in a statement. “Our goal is to harness the benefits of AI for our local economy while mitigating potential risks through thoughtful policy and planning. It’s important to hear from Rhode Islanders as we continue to shape the future of AI in RI.”
McKee assembled the AI Task Force in February 2024 to investigate how the Ocean State can responsibly use and build policy around the rapidly expanding and increasingly popular set of technologies colloquially referred to as AI. The rise of generative AI since 2022 has especially shaped widespread consumer and industry use of programs that can create text and images, analyze data, or perform an assortment of mundane tasks. The group includes representatives from multiple sectors including state government, tech, health care, education, business and other sectors.  
The committee is chaired by former U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, who also chairs the Institute of Cybersecurity and Emerging Technologies at Rhode Island College, another McKee-led project. Chris Parisi, the founder and CEO of Trailblaze Marketing in Providence, serves as the task force’s vice chair.
“The AI Task Force is hard at work to identify the most effective ways Rhode Island can harness the power of this emerging technology while minimizing the risks it brings,” Langevin said in a statement. “As we create our roadmap, we’re asking the public to offer their insights on if and how they’d like to see artificial intelligence implemented across the state, as well as to share any concerns about the future of this technology.”
The survey has five sections, from queries about respondents’ basic familiarity with AI to how people use AI in their job. Questions about on-the-job usage are tailored to the industry selected from a list, which includes government, finance, education, health care, manufacturing/trade/defense, and small businesses/nonprofits/start-ups.
Questions across the survey include “How has AI changed your job in the past 2 years?,” “What do you believe are the biggest opportunities AI brings to Rhode Island?” and “Do you believe AI should be regulated?”
A final section, “AI and the Future of Rhode Island,” invites respondents to muse on whether Rhode Island should or should not “position itself as a leader in AI.”
Respondents can include their email address to receive future updates and information about events, including those with potentially more opportunities for public feedback, from the AI task force.

Marti, R-Broken Arrow, whispers with Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, during a special legislative hearing probing the finances of the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services on Monday. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state’s mental health department should go back to budgeting basics and build out guidelines for the services it must provide, the head of a legislative fiscal oversight agency said Monday.
Regina Birchum, executive director of the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency, said the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services is treating its appropriations as “fungible,” or interchangeable, making it difficult for officials to make sense of how it is being spent.
Of the 195 accounts the Department of Mental Health budgeted for in fiscal year 2024, a LOFT analysis found that 115 were over budget, while 66 were under budget. In all, over $29.3 million was overbudgeted, while about $57.6 million was underbudgeted.
“I would say this is an agency that has a long-standing issue with proper accounting of funds,” Birchum said. “We’re not saying anything improper was done. We’re saying that funds are not properly accounted for in such a way that an outsider can determine what they were spent on, and it’s our hope that we can make some recommendations that will bring some clarity to them.”
Birchum made her comments under oath during the third day of testimony during a special hearing at the state Capitol where House lawmakers continue to probe reports of financial disarray at the mental health agency as well as why some provider contracts were abruptly cut or canceled. Lawmakers were frustrated at a lack of answers from mental health officials during the first two days of testimony. But at the conclusion of Monday’s hearing, some said LOFT helped shed some light on spending and budgeting practices.
Birchum said her agency has been investigating the mental health department at the Legislature’s request since early March. In particular, it has been probing the mental health department’s reported $43 million deficit and whether the agency’s $6.2 million supplement request will be enough to finish the fiscal year.
LOFT assists the Legislature in finding factual information about budgets to hold agencies accountable for properly spending funds. 
Birchum said the mental health officials initially believed they had a $63.7 million shortfall, but later found $19.6 million that could be used for Medicaid reimbursements and another $10.5 million in contract savings. That reduced the overall deficit to $33.6 million.
LOFT records indicate investigators were unsure where the remaining $27.4 million would come to reach the $6.2 million figure, but noted the mental health department continued to work on its budget review.
She said the agency’s $6.2 million supplemental request includes funding to bridge revenue shortfalls for two different facilities and $4.1 million to cover costs related to the recent mental health competency restoration settlement agreement. The later funding was already appropriated by lawmakers, she said.
Birchum said LOFT was also told that all initial cuts to providers have been restored.
Rep. T.J. Marti, R-Broken Arrow,  said after the hearing that lawmakers expect to have some firm budget numbers this week from the mental health department, but said putting caps on what providers can charge for some crisis services could help provide more budget certainty.
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, who chairs the special committee, said LOFT provided needed detail about the mental health department’s “poor accounting practices” that “lends to the inability to produce real numbers.”
Lawmakers only have 22 working days left in session. Lawson said the committee needs to quickly determine the current financial picture of the mental health department, if a $6.2 million supplement appropriation will be enough, and what sort of budget the agency needs moving forward.
“I feel much more confident that we could work together to put something together that we feel like has some fidelity to it, but it’s certainly concerning that we’re this far into session, and we don’t have the clarity that we need to do our job,” he said.
Lawson said there likely will be some legislation that emerges from the hearings. Some additional testimony may be conducted behind closed doors because it “may be of a protected nature” under non-disclosure agreements, he said.
If time allows, the committee may require the state’s mental health commissioner to testify again.

Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.
GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-time, minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.”

Using health programs to encourage work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women and disabled people.

Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The hunt for results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A day after telling lawmakers it wouldn’t hire a chief financial officer until it “gets through” its budget situation, a state agency said it is moving forward with filling the position permanently.
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ job posting Friday came a day after House lawmakers questioned the qualifications of Skip Leonard, the agency’s interim CFO. During an extensive grilling, he was unable to answer basic questions about the agency’s financial irregularities.
Leonard, a former city manager, said he has no experience overseeing finances for a state agency and is not a certified public accountant. Lawmakers said he was being paid $165 an hour to serve as interim or as much as $343,000 a year.
Leonard told lawmakers that the mental health department was waiting to hire a permanent CFO until it “gets through” its current budget situation. 
Lawmakers are trying to determine why the agency has a $43 million shortfall and why mental health officials believe a $6.2 million supplemental appropriation would be enough to fill the gap.
Leonard, who oversees the agency’s over $610 million budget, was unable to answer many of the questions, leading some lawmakers to focus instead on his own qualifications and pay rate. 
The agency said in a statement to Oklahoma Voice on Monday that it posted the position on Friday “as part of our ongoing operational readiness and succession planning.”
The agency did not provide a responsive statement as to what changed between Leonard’s testimony Thursday and Friday when the job was posted.
“The agency wants to ensure it is positioned for success in the future,” the agency’s statement said. “We remain committed to making staffing decisions only when they are fully aligned with both fiscal priorities and operational needs.”
Rep. T.J. Marti, R-Broken Arrow, who was among the legislators who questioned Leonard’s qualifications, said Monday that hadn’t heard that the agency had launched a search for a new CFO, but said it’s “great news.”
“I think they need to launch a search for a CFO, somebody that can dig deep into the numbers and that is trained for the position,” Marti said. “It sounded like they were going to name Skip the CFO, and I’m not so sure that that’s something that many of us in here would be on board with.”

Assistant coach Justin Parker will serve as interim head coach for the remainder of the season.
Mississippi State made the announcement in a press release Monday afternoon. 
“A change in leadership is what is best for the future of Mississippi State baseball,” State athletic director Zac Selmon said. “We have not consistently met the standard of success that our university, fans and student-athletes expect and deserve. I want to thank Coach Lemonis for his work and the time he gave to our program, including a national championship in 2021. We appreciate his efforts and wish him and his family all the best moving forward.”
A national search is underway to identify the program’s next head coach, Selmon said.
“In a team meeting moments ago, I expressed to our student-athletes the confidence we have in their abilities and the potential they have for the remainder of the season,” Selmon said. “I encouraged them to compete with pride, resilience, and intensity. With the hard work, preparation, and talent already within this group, we are committed to putting them in the best position to finish the season competing at the highest level.
“Mississippi State is the premier job in college baseball. The tradition, the facilities, the NIL offerings and the fan base are all second to none. Dudy Noble Field is the best environment in the sport, period.”
The current Bulldogs have a 25-19 record and are 7-14 in the SEC. Most recently, the Bulldogs lost two of three weekend games to Auburn, the nation’s 11th-ranked team. State has lost its last two SEC series and five of seven this season. The Bulldogs are currently No. 45 in the nation in ratings percentage index (RPI) and are in danger of not making the NCAA Tournament for the third time in four years.
Lemonis’ MSU teams won 232 games and lost 135 in his six-plus seasons. Hired by former MSU baseball coach and athletic director John Cohen from Indiana, Lemonis has an overall coaching record of 373-226-2.
“This program is built for success,” Selmon said. “Our history proves it, and our future demands it. We are one of only four programs in NCAA history to reach the College World Series in six consecutive decades. With 40 NCAA Tournament appearances, 12 trips to Omaha, 11 SEC regular season titles, and a national championship, our program has always been a national contender. That is the bar. We’re going to find a leader who will embrace that, elevate our program and compete for championships.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06184656/AP_21182116611315-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

The landfill is expected to reach capacity in 2028. (Photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)As the state’s largest landfill nears capacity amid concerns about the environmental impact of possible expansion, two legislators that represent its neighboring communities are seeking greater legislative oversight for the state-owned Juniper Ridge Landfill.
The Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee held a public hearing Monday for a series of bills related to waste management, including two that seek to address and increase oversight of future use of the landfill, which straddles Old Town and Alton. The facility is owned by the state through the Bureau of General Services, which has an operating contract with NEWSME Landfill Operations, a subsidiary of the waste management company Casella. 
When Rep. Jim Dill (D-Old Town) knocked on doors before last November’s election, one of the biggest complaints he heard from residents was the poor quality of the garbage bags they must purchase to dispose of their trash. That’s why LD 1782 would require the operator of a state-owned landfill to provide free disposal of household waste for the local residents. 
However, Dill explained that his bill also seeks to address what he described as the “crisis” of the landfill soon reaching capacity by imposing new fees on the operator and requiring state agencies to develop a solid waste management plan that addresses the issues associated with Juniper Ridge. 
The committee also heard bills seeking to increase recycling of construction materials, reduce the volume of solid waste and better manage waste from wastewater treatment plants. 
The Departments of Environmental Protection and Administrative and Financial Services opposed Dill’s proposal. Since the DEP is already required to submit a waste generation and disposal capacity report in January, the department argued the additional reporting requirements in the bill would be burdensome. 
Just over half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up in Juniper Ridge, which is expected to reach capacity in 2028. The state has signaled its support for expanding the facility despite objections from environmental advocates, the local community and the Penobscot Nation, whose reservation sits just five miles from the landfill.
The Bureau of General Services has not submitted an application to expand the landfill, but Deputy Commissioner Anya Trundy said during the hearing it intends to. However, the site expansion is separate from an extension of the current 30-year operator agreement that expires in 2034. 
Trundy said that building out the landfill to its maximum capacity should allow it to operate until 2040. That is why the expanded capacity would also necessitate extending the contract with Casella so that both line up with the 2040 timeline. 
The committee also heard a bill from Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot) that, if passed, would shape the process of extending that contract. While the executive branch has so far handled the negotiations, LD 1349 would require approval from two-thirds of the Legislature for contract or contract renewal to operate Juniper Ridge. 
Maine opens door for landfill expansion despite community objections

Though the Department of Administrative and Financial Services would normally advocate for contracts to go out to bid, Trundy said doing so could sever the indemnification clause in the existing contract. Rather than giving Casella a “sweetheart deal,” Trundy said continuing the agreement holds them accountable to that clause that would leave them responsible for financial and environmental liability down the road. 
Committee members also voiced concern that requiring two-thirds support from the Legislature would be insurmountable; however, environmental organizations who testified in support of the bill were open to changing that to a simple majority because they have concerns over Casella’s operation of the landfill and welcomed more opportunity for public input. 
Maulian Bryant, executive director for the Wabanaki Alliance, spoke in support of LD 1349 over similar dissatisfaction with the landfill’s management. She said changes to air and water quality that can be affected by the landfill isn’t communicated to neighbors who can often smell the facility from their front yards. 
However, the Maine State Chamber of Commerce opposed the bill, saying that it could politicize the contract process and deter companies from doing business with the state.  
Tipping put forward another proposal that was heard Monday seeking to address forever chemicals from landfill leachate entering groundwater and surface waters. 
The legislation would require entities discharging wastewater to annually report to the DEP the origin, volume and final disposition of solid waste leachate, sometimes referred to as “trash juice.” It would also prohibit discharging any wastewater containing leachate from a solid waste landfill unless the discharge satisfies department limits to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, and require third-party testing of leachate for PFAS.
Last session, the Legislature passed a bill that would have required Casella to treat PFAS in a way that ensures levels don’t exceed established drinking water standards, but the measure was vetoed by Gov. Janet Mills. The DEP later mandated that Casella install a department-approved system for treating landfill leachate for PFAS before expanding operations.

One person died at a Casper home Monday after police received a report of an armed burglar. Court files reviewed by WyoFile show she was listed as a legal resident of the house.
The post Woman killed when Casper police responded to burglary report lived at the home, court documents show appeared first on WyoFile .","A woman killed Monday morning during an encounter with police responding to a burglary report at a Casper residence is listed in court documents as living in the home.
Police have declined to say if the person killed was a criminal suspect or the resident of the house, but court records examined by WyoFile indicate the woman, 37-year-old Jody Cobia, legally resided at the home.
Casper police officers responded to the 1600 block of South McKinley Street, a residential neighborhood in the central part of the city, around 12:36 a.m. Monday. They were responding to a report of an armed burglar in the residence, according to a police statement. 
The officers “made contact with a subject armed with a firearm,” shots were fired and the woman was then taken to the hospital, where doctors declared her dead, the statement said. 
The statement is not explicit about whether officers shot Cobia. “During the encounter, shots were fired,” it reads.

A department official declined to provide WyoFile with additional information Monday morning, including whether the person who was shot lived at the home, citing the early stages of the investigation. 
Early Monday afternoon, the Natrona County Coroners’ Office identified the dead woman as Cobia. Court records reviewed by WyoFile indicate she had sole legal possession of the home as part of a protection order granted in August, though tax records put the home in her husband’s name.
According to the filings, Cobia was the mother of three children and was in the early stages of a divorce from her husband. Court records indicate Cobia petitioned a judge for, and received, a protection order from her husband in August. 
That protection order, reviewed by WyoFile, granted Cobia sole possession of the house, 1623 S. McKinley Street, until August of this year. Multiple court documents list the McKinley Street address as her residence.
Mid-morning Monday, a WyoFile journalist observed that the door of 1623 S. McKinley street remained slightly open, though there was no other evidence of an active crime scene investigation nearly 12 hours after the shooting. 
On Monday, Casper Police Capt. Jeremy Tremel declined to say whether the person shot was the home resident or a burglary suspect, or whether there was a burglary suspect on the scene. “All I can tell you right now is we responded to a report of a suspected burglary,” he said.
He did not immediately respond to a second request for comment after the coroner published its identification. 
Cobia’s husband, Aren Cobia, indicated he was a resident of the home in a divorce petition filed earlier this month. But the court record also indicates Jody Cobia was served with the divorce petition, in person, at the South McKinley Street address on April 15. 
Reached briefly by WyoFile, Aren Cobia asked for time to grieve Jody Cobia’s death and declined to otherwise comment. Aren Cobia told a reporter from another news outlet, Cowboy State Daily, that there was no burglar in the home and police had killed his wife. 
The Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation will investigate the shooting. After police shootings, it’s typical for DCI to conduct an investigation and then provide the findings of that review to an elected county attorney. The prosecutor then decides whether or not to charge officers with any crimes. Prosecutors, in some cases, refer that decision to an outside county attorney to bring an additional level of independence to the investigation.
The officers involved in the shooting are now on administrative leave, according to the department’s news release. 
Officials did not describe the person shot as a suspect in that news release, only as a “subject armed with a firearm.” Because of the ambiguity of the official statement, commenters on social media, as well as two Wyoming news outlets, described the deceased as a criminal suspect.
“Suspected burglar dead in Casper Police shooting,” was the headline on an initial Cowboy State Daily story that was online throughout the morning Monday. By the early afternoon, the news site had updated that headline to “One dead in officer-involved shooting during Casper burglary response,” and the site had issued a correction. 
“Suspect dead after Casper police respond to armed burglary,” Casper-news site Oil City News reported. 
On Facebook, a large number of commenters commended the officers who responded to the home and in several instances suggested a burglary suspect deserved to be killed. “Finally a story with a happy ending,” one commenter wrote. “Clearly he valued their stuff more than his life and got what he deserved,” wrote another.

  Sen. Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin Examiner, 2024 photo)
The letter, led by Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and two colleagues,  follows a funding halt in late January and early February; the closure of Head Start regional offices in April and the termination of those offices’ employees; and a subsequent report that the program has reduced payments in this first half of 2025 compared with a year ago.
“It is abundantly clear that these actions are part of a broader effort to ultimately eliminate the program altogether, as the Administration reportedly plans to do in its fiscal year 2026 budget proposal,” states the letter sent by Baldwin, Sens. Patty Murray (D-Washington) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), and 39 other Senate members.
Head Start has already been appropriated $12.3 billion for 2025 — the same amount as in 2024 — and has a formula for allocating funds, the senators wrote, leaving “no justifiable reason” for funding delays, while there has been no explanation from the administration.
Earlier in April it was reported the Trump administration’s 2026 budget proposal included no funding for Head Start. The senators’ letter notes that the Office of Management and Budget directed the Department of Health and Human Services to set aside funds from the 2025 budget “to close out the program” in budget documents leaked 10 days ago.
“If this explains any of the delay in awarding fiscal year 2025 funding, we want to be clear, no funds were provided in fiscal year 2025 to ‘close out the program,’ and it would be wholly unacceptable and likely illegal if the Department tries to carry out this directive,” the senators wrote.
The letter is directed at U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“You promised ‘radical transparency’ as Secretary, yet it is unclear how these actions will improve Head Start programs, and you and your staff refuse to respond to basic inquiries and requests for information,” the senators wrote.
The letter cites additional Trump administration actions involving the program over the last three months.
The federal Office of Head Start has told local programs that funding would not be approved for “training and technical assistance or other program expenditures that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives,” but the agency hasn’t provided any guidance “for what would be considered ‘DEI,’” the letter states.
Nevertheless, the senators add, that could conflict with requirements for the program under federal law, such as one that programs provide appropriate instruction for English learners.
Programs submitting documentation for payment of expenses that they have incurred and are authorized under their federal grants are now being asked to provide additional justification, which the letter states “creates an illusion of improving oversight but only serves to add unnecessary red tape. “
The five-page letter asks Kennedy to answer a series of questions, including whether HHS will reverse the regional office closures and reinstate fired Head Start personnel, when Head Start agencies will receive confirmation that they can access their additional grant installments for the year and whether the administration will distribute all of Head Start’s funds for the 2025 fiscal year “as required by the Head Start Act.”

Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, speaks about term limits during a committee hearing on Jan. 23, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A bill clarifying the state date for North Dakota’s term limits law failed in the House on a 61-28 vote Monday.
The bill was debated over multiple conference committee meetings in recent days. The Senate version contained a Jan. 1, 2023 start date for the term limits, while the House version advanced a Nov. 7, 2022 start date.
North Dakota voters in 2022 approved a ballot measure that limits lawmakers to serving up to eight years in each chamber.
Previously, Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, chief sponsor of House Bill 1300, said the bill was to provide clarity on the start date for term limits approved by the voters. 
Term limits bill reconsidered, headed to North Dakota conference committee

Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, said the House reconsidered its actions after previously voting against the bill and sent the measure to a conference committee to see if senators would agree to the House’s start date.
“It didn’t look like we kept our position, so I’d ask for a red vote,” Vetter said before voting against the bill. 
The failure of the bill in the House leaves Senate Resolution 4008, which passed both chambers of the Legislature, as the only term limit resolution passed by lawmakers during the 2025 session. If approved by the Secretary of State’s Office as a valid resolution it would go to the voters as a ballot measure during the 2026 general election.
The resolution would allow lawmakers to serve four terms, up to 16 years, in a single legislative chamber. It also clarifies that a partial term does not count against the limit.

Shri Thanedar speaks at his election night party in Detroit on Aug. 6, 2024 (Photo by Ken Coleman)Michigan Congressman Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) on Monday brought seven articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, saying the president has “repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit to serve,” and “represents a clear and present danger to our nation’s constitution and our democracy.”
In a statement from Thanedar’s office, he pointed to “sweeping abuse of power, flagrant violations of the Constitution and acts of tyranny that undermine American democracy and threaten the rule of law” as his reasons for introducing the charges.
“[Trump’s] unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service. We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act,” Thanedar said.
Each article alleges a separate violation of the Constitution, with Thanedar’s office offering the following breakdown of his resolution:

 Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice.
Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds.
Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations.
Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech.
Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution.
Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain.
Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.

“This is not about partisanship. It’s about protecting our democracy and ensuring that no one, not even a President, is above the law,” Thanedar said in a statement.
Thanedar’s effort is likely to face an uphill battle in the House, where Republicans hold a seven seat majority. The Senate, which conducts the trial should the resolution receive a majority of votes in the House, is also held by Republicans, with a two-thirds vote needed in order to convict the president.
Thanedar’s introduction of the articles comes the same day that his second primary opponent, state Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit), announced he would seek his 13th District seat in the 2026 primary.

McHENRY — John Gerend, a Vietnam War veteran from Lake Villa, Illinois, was exposed to Agent Orange while on duty. Suffering from diseases associated with exposure to the toxic chemical, he said he still considers himself fortunate.

“I've had some issues with it — diabetes, some heart issues and so on — but there are many more that have suffered a lot more than I have and need the care a lot more than I do,” said Gerend, 77. “It's very upsetting to think that the people who have served their country and have lost limbs or mental health might now lose the benefits, all the support, both for mental health and physical health, and the doctors and medications available.”

“I am mad about what’s going on. I’m angry,” he added.

A retired U.S. Army first lieutenant, Gerend was among the 200 people who gathered outside the McHenry Veterans Affairs clinic Sunday to protest the Trump administration’s plans to slash the agency’s workforce, sparking fears among veterans over the prospect of worsening care and growing unemployment.

Across Illinois, protests have been gaining strength since the proposed cuts were revealed. They range from veterans protesting last month at the Capitol in Springfield to demonstrations by nurses and staff at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago, who are concerned about the dangers to proper care and risk for veterans.

In an internal memo to senior agency leaders on March 4, VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek said the agency's initial goal was “to return to our 2019-end strength numbers of 399,957 employees.” VA Secretary Doug Collins later confirmed the department’s target is to fire roughly 80,000 employees later this year, but he insisted the agency would strive for more efficiency while not cutting benefits and care to the 9 million veterans it serves. According to the Pew Research Center, a quarter of the workers at the Department of Veterans Affairs are themselves veterans.

The move comes after the VA expanded during the Biden administration, fueled by the passing of legislation like the 2022 Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics, PACT, Act, expanding medical benefits for veterans who were exposed to toxins from burn pits of trash on military bases.

“I'm getting later in my years, so it's gonna affect some younger folks possibly more than me, so I'm more afraid for them than I am for myself,” said Gerend, who has used VA services for 12 years.

VA workers in distress

The VA attempted to lay off at least 2,400 probationary employees in February. According to the department,  those in “mission-critical” positions — including Veterans Crisis Line responders — were not affected. Yet, several crisis line staffers received a notice, according to union leaders.

Some of the department’s Illinois workers were axed, too, and U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth said the ensuing “chaos” had left the VA less efficient with longer wait times and more backlogs in service.

“I was almost finished with my two-year-long probationary period when I received an email saying I was terminated because of my performance effective that day, (Feb. 24),” said one Illinois-based VA employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “I had outstanding performance reviews, but the fact that they labeled it as a performance-based solution meant that I couldn't get unemployment (benefits).”

The employee was rehired in March after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the fired probationary employees at several departments, including the VA.

In April, however, the Supreme Court halted the federal judge's ruling, allowing the federal government to keep thousands of probationary federal employees it attempted to fire off the payroll while lower courts weigh whether the downsizing efforts are legal.

“Everybody is nervous and on edge,” the employee said. “Their jobs are not secure. Nobody's jobs are secure.”

With the threat of more cuts looming, some Illinois facilities have already started laying people off, causing health care workers more distress.

Heather Fallon, a VA nurse in the Chicago area, said one of her colleagues returned to the facility as a patient after learning that their job “was being eliminated.”

“The person had a conversation with family over dinner about how they are going to pay for their daughter’s college,” she recalled. “The patient ended up developing some pain related to the stress, coming to the emergency department and being admitted because of the health problems that were precipitated by the stress that that person was under.”

“That really affected our staff quite a lot,” Fallon added.

Some fear that the upcoming mass layoffs, especially in smaller towns across rural Illinois, are going to negatively impact populations at large.

“Danville is a small town. It consists of about 29,000 people, and if we lose 400 good-paying government jobs, that will devastate our economy here,” said Mickensy Ellis-White, a veteran of the Iraq War from Vermilion County and chair of the Vermilion County Democratic Party. “Where are those people going to go to get new jobs? That's going to negatively affect all of us.”

The level of care diminishes 

Even before the cuts were announced by the Trump administration, it had been difficult for health facilities within the VA system to maintain enough staff and resources, like beds, available. According to the 2024 VA Office of Inspector General report, 86% of all Veteran Health Administration medical facilities reported severe staffing shortages of medical officers, whereas 82% reported severe shortages of nurses.

The mass slashes to the department’s workforce will only worsen the preexisting lack of personnel, according to Fallon, who said she knows of several nurses who have already submitted job applications to other places in the private sector as the threat of the layoffs looms. “A friend of mine at the St. Louis VA had her care appointment canceled because they didn't have a provider, and that's a direct result of the cuts,” said Jessica Motsinger, a disabled U.S. Navy veteran living 12 miles east of St Louis in the Metro East. “It really is devastating, and if it hasn't really affected somebody, it will very shortly.”

This is not an isolated incident.

“We had a patient yesterday who needed services that we didn't have open beds at our facility. The solution was that they were going to send him to a different facility, more than an hour away, and he was very upset about that,” Fallon said. “He wasn't able to go home to get his belongings, and he didn't feel like his belongings were safe where they were, and his family wouldn't be able to visit him there, so he would be very isolated.”

According to the official data, 247,140 Illinoisians were enrolled in the VA health care system in fiscal year 2023, and the state’s veteran medical facilities provided services to 162,366 unique patients. Although the impacts of the layoffs are likely to extend throughout the state, the cuts would hit northeastern Illinois the hardest, the counties with the highest percentage of veteran population.

Many veterans are fearful of what is to come — but also angry.

“They think that, since we use the word ‘disabled,’ somehow we're receiving benefits that we're not entitled to,” Motsinger said. “But people don't get this just because we somehow scammed somebody or paid something, we've totally earned this. We raised our hand; we offered to sacrifice our lives.”

“I'm sorry America decided to have war for over 20 years. Now you have veterans, an entire generation that you owe us to care for us, not asking for anything other than what we've earned,” she said.

An ICE spokesperson acknowledged the structure on Monday, after South Florida U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Democrat, said she saw a “tent city” at the Krome North Service Processing Center during her visit Thursday. Wilson decided to visit the detention facility after hearing that people had to sleep on concrete floors.
“The new multi-use facility is a climate-controlled structure with beds, showers and bathrooms to house detainees,” ICE public affairs officer Nestor Yglesias wrote to the Florida Phoenix. “The facility complies with detention standards in accordance with ICE policy. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not provide population or capacity numbers due to operational tempo and security concerns.”
Yglesias described the structure as hard-sided but didn’t provide information about the number of beds or whether ICE had added other semi-permanent buildings in other detention centers in the state.

After her visit to Krome, Wilson told reporters that she had seen a “tent city” that she estimated could house 400 people and that officials told her had been built in 14 days. The ICE spokesperson declined to confirm how long it took to build the structure. Wilson also said she hadn’t seen overcrowding that immigrant rights groups, detainees, and attorneys have reported.
“This is not my first rodeo. I was down at Homestead when the children were there, and I’ve been to Krome before, and I’ve been to prisons all across Florida, especially female prisons,” Wilson said. “So, I know what they do. They take them on a field trip, so you won’t see who is actually in there, but they did admit that they are building a tent city.”
Juan Agudelo, field office director for ICE in Miami, said some detention centers experienced temporary overcrowding but that conditions Wilson saw in Krome were not staged.
“What Congresswoman Wilson saw today is what ICE does on a daily basis,” Agudelo said in a statement. “Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.”
A four-day large-scale operation in which federal authorities and local police claimed they had arrested nearly 800 people subject to deportation could lead to increased population numbers at Krome.

Arraj U.S. Courthouse in downtown Denver on May 30, 2023. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)President Donald Trump’s administration is asking a panel of appellate judges to overturn a lower court’s order temporarily blocking the deportation of detainees in Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act.
Trump has invoked the centuries-old law for just the fourth time in U.S. history in an attempt to expedite the removals of hundreds of people the administration claims are part of an “invasion” of the United States by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. It was used last month to send 137 detainees to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador before multiple federal courts, including one in Colorado, ordered a halt to such removals over due process concerns.
U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s temporary restraining order against Alien Enemies Act removals from Colorado is set to remain in effect until at least May 6, but Trump’s Department of Justice promptly appealed Sweeney’s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.

The government has asked the three-judge panel hearing the appeal — Judges Harris L. Hartz, Gregory Alan Phillips and Joel M. Carson — to rule on its motion to overturn Sweeney’s TRO by no later than Tuesday afternoon, arguing that the order’s “impositions interfere with the President’s core authority to protect the nation.”
The case, D.B.U. v. Trump, originated earlier this month as a petition for habeas corpus and proposed class action by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora. The plaintiffs, who are identified by their initials, D.B.U. and R.M.M., say they have been falsely identified as Tren de Aragua members by the Trump administration and fear imminent deportation to the CECOT facility, criticized by human rights groups for its crowded and abusive conditions.
Sweeney’s order also provisionally certified the class that the two plaintiffs seek to represent, blocking the removal of “all noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to” Trump’s March 14 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act. ACLU attorneys estimate that could apply to more than 100 detainees held at the Aurora detention center.
About 90% of the deportees sent to CECOT last month had no criminal record, according to Bloomberg. At least one, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members for other deportees say that they were falsely identified as TdA members because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team. Trump has openly floated plans to send American citizens to CECOT next.
DOJ attorneys continued to argue in a Court of Appeals filing Sunday that the courts lack jurisdiction to hear the case because the “Petitioners have not been designated as alien enemies under the AEA.” At the same time, they rejected widespread due process concerns and defended the administration’s practice of providing as little as 12 hours’ notice to detainees to indicate they wish to contest their designation as alien enemies.
“The AEA permits the Executive enormous discretion to establish the conditions and processes the Executive will use to implement a Presidential Proclamation, and does not impose any particular notice time period,” the DOJ’s filing says.
Sweeney’s order requires ICE to provide at least 21 days’ notice, written in a language the detainee understands. But Trump’s DOJ argues that providing an English-language form that is “explained orally in another language, if necessary,” is sufficient.
In a response to the DOJ’s appeal, attorneys for D.B.U. and R.M.M. again accused the Trump administration of failing to comply with a Supreme Court opinion earlier this month requiring greater due process for AEA designees.
“The Supreme Court made unequivocally clear that individuals designated under the AEA are entitled to ‘due process’ and ‘notice and opportunity to be heard,’” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “In short, 12 hours would be unreasonable under any circumstances but it is especially unreasonable here given the nature of the class and the consequences of ending up in a Salvadoran prison for the rest of their lives.”

In November 2020, a federal grand jury indicted Chelsea Gless, then 31, of Princeton, Iowa, on multiple counts of mail fraud. Prosecutors alleged Gless, as part-owner and manager of Royal Metals Group, offered prospective clients an opportunity to purchase and sell precious metals, such as gold and silver, through the company for an agreed-upon fee.
Gless pleaded guilty to one count of felony mail fraud, punishable by up to 20 years of imprisonment, and six other charges were dropped. She was sentenced to three years in prison, plus three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $2,935,906 in restitution.
Gless was released from prison in November 2023, and in 2024 was awarded an associate’s degree in nursing from Scott Community College.
In October 2024, she applied for an Iowa registered nurse’s license and was denied on the basis of her felony conviction. She appealed that decision and requested a hearing. Board records indicate the hearing was scheduled for April 10 — but on that day, Gless and the board entered into consent agreement in which the board agreed to issue Gless a license to work in Iowa as a registered nurse, subject to monitoring and three years of probationary status.
As part of that agreement, board has barred Gless from working in any setting, such as a nursing home, “where patients are particularly vulnerable to exploitation,” and where she might have access to patients’ financial information.
In her criminal case, prosecutors alleged that between May 2014 and February 2018, Gless devised and carried out a scheme to defraud clients of Royal Metals Group, in part by using their money to make personal credit card payments.
When clients inquired as to the status of payments they were owed, or the delivery of precious metals they had purchased, Gless allegedly sent them falsified tracking numbers for deliveries, sent them unsigned checks or checks made out for the wrong amount, or sent them checks that later bounced due to insufficient funds, court records show.
At least 71 clients were defrauded a total of more than $2.9 million, prosecutors claimed. Assistant U.S. Attorney Rachel J. Scherle told the court Gless’ conduct was “financially and emotionally devastating” to the victims.
“Chelsea Gless was running the business, and she was in charge,” Scherle said. “Chelsea Gless had the power to stop the manipulation, but she continued to lie and lie over and over again until there were no more metals or money – leaving the victims high and dry.”
Court records indicate one of Gless’ victims lost their entire retirement savings of $260,326, telling prosecutors, “I am a very quiet, non-confrontational person. Just the thought of contacting the FBI was so stressful to me that my daughter had to step in and do the contact for me.”
Gless’ attorneys characterized her as a pawn in the business which was initiated by her husband, Richard Gless, who was 20 years older than Chelsea. Richard Gless died in 2012, before the alleged fraud occurred. Court records indicate that as of January 2025, Gless had paid $14,201 toward restitution, leaving $2,921,391 still owed.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BON-1024x459.jpg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

Ray Holmberg, left, served 45 years in the North Dakota Legislature. Wayne Stenehjem, right, served as attorney general for 22 years. The two Republicans were close associates who began their political careers at the same time. (Photos provided by Sherburne (Minn.) County Jail, Office of Attorney General)Newly released call logs show the late Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem communicated with former Sen. Ray Holmberg as the lawmaker was being investigated for sex crimes, including calls the day Stenehjem sat for a law enforcement interview.
Yet Stenehjem only told law enforcement about one phone conversation with Holmberg, according to Attorney General Drew Wrigley, who succeeded Stenehjem after his January 2022 death.
“That’s a pretty troubling log,” Wrigley said late Friday after his office made the call logs public. “The attorney general was asked about contacts with Ray Holmberg. He said that he had spoken to him once, and that was not accurate.”
There also is evidence that Stenehjem and the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation knew years earlier about a sexual assault allegation against Holmberg but no criminal charges resulted from that report.
Holmberg was sentenced late last month to 10 years in federal prison for traveling out of the country with the intent to pay for sex with underage boys. That conviction largely resulted from a federal investigation that began in 2021.
Holmberg sexually exploited others, including people in North Dakota, witnesses say in court

But a man who spoke at the March 26 sentencing hearing came forward to the FBI years earlier to report sexual exploitation by Holmberg.  
Handwritten notes in a former Grand Forks prosecutor’s file obtained by the North Dakota Monitor indicate Stenehjem knew in 2015 about that report.
David Jones, former Grand Forks County state’s attorney, wrote in an Aug. 31, 2015, note:  “A.G. office doesn’t want T.F. involved at all. (Wayne decision.)”
Jones said he used the initials T.F. as shorthand for a multi-jurisdictional law enforcement task force. The state BCI, within the attorney general’s office, is part of the task force.
Jones’ notes indicate that federal investigators were looking into reports of overseas trips. Jones said he did not talk to Stenehjem directly and does not know why he didn’t want the task force involved.
“If it’s a federal investigation, part of the thing is, we don’t want to step on their toes as they’re going forward with something,” Jones said. “So anything beyond that, it’d just be speculative on my part.”
Holmberg and Stenehjem were known to be friends, both beginning their time in public service in 1977 as Republican state legislators from Grand Forks. Stenehjem went on to become North Dakota’s longest-serving attorney general, and Holmberg spent 45 years in the Legislature, rising to the powerful role of Senate Appropriations chair.
Beth Stenehjem defended her husband in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor.
“It is nothing short of unfortunate that after the release of Wayne’s emails, text messages, and interview with the BCI, there remains misguided focus to find a connection between him and Mr. Holmberg’s criminal activity. As everything has shown, there is none,” she wrote. “This misguided effort is especially disappointing in the fact that Wayne is not here to defend himself against these baseless assumptions and accusations that are nothing but pure speculation.”
Call logs
Call logs show communications between Holmberg and Stenehjem in December 2021 and January 2022, including connections made on three dates. Holmberg called on Dec. 9, 2021, and they had a 43-second conversation. Holmberg left a 16-second voicemail on Dec. 19, 2021, which law enforcement did not recover, records show. Holmberg called Jan. 10, 2022, and they talked for 11 minutes, the logs show.
A report also shows that federal prosecutors asked law enforcement to compare what messaging apps Holmberg and Stenehjem had on their cellphones that could be used for communication. Both had WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook Messenger and others, documents show. 
The logs show 11 phone text messages between Holmberg and Stenehjem during December 2021, but not about the investigation. The texts primarily discussed state politics, including who was going to be appointed tax commissioner.
Stenehjem did not report the communications to law enforcement, Wrigley said. 
“You’re talking to a guy who is the subject of a very serious investigation,” Wrigley said. “That you’re talking to him at all is an outrage, and on top of it you’re not telling law enforcement that ‘he continues to call me, I talked to him, and he said the following things.’”
Former ND Sen. Ray Holmberg sentenced to 10 years in prison for sex crime

Stenehjem, who oversaw the BCI, had not recused himself from the Holmberg case, according to Wrigley.
On Nov. 17, 2021, after law enforcement seized Holmberg’s phone and electronic devices while executing a search warrant at his home, Holmberg asked for Stenehjem’s phone number, Dan Casetta, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, said during Holmberg’s sentencing hearing.
Stenehjem received two calls that day from a number identified in his contacts as “Holmberg Burner Phone,” records show. Both calls were rejected and Holmberg left one voicemail, records show.
Holmberg told Stenehjem in the voicemail that he was in “big trouble,” Casetta testified. Holmberg also tried calling Stenehjem at his office that day and left a message with an assistant. Stenehjem did share that voicemail with law enforcement at the time.
On Dec. 1, 2021, Stenehjem was interviewed by Homeland Security Investigations about the November voicemail, records show. 
That same day, call logs show five phone calls between Stenehjem and Holmberg, though the logs do not indicate they spoke. The documents show Stenehjem calling Holmberg once but the call was not answered. Holmberg initiated the other four calls, which were all rejected, documents show. Holmberg left a 14-second voicemail, which law enforcement did not recover, records show.
Holmberg also texted “Hi from Ray” on the day of the former attorney general’s interview with law enforcement, but the records do not indicate Stenehjem responded.
A report detailing the law enforcement interview with Stenehjem has not yet been made public. 
Wrigley said he learned from law enforcement that Stenehjem told investigators about one phone conversation he had with Holmberg. When asked what Holmberg said about the search warrant, Stenehjem said it never came up and the conversation had only been about politics, according to Wrigley.
When investigators later reviewed Stenehjem’s phone data, they discovered that the voicemails from Holmberg had been deleted, including the one from the day of the search warrant, Wrigley said.
“Nobody can understand why anybody, let alone an attorney general, would delete evidence that has been collected in the furtherance of a criminal investigation,” Wrigley said. “But that’s what happened.”
Beth Stenehjem said her late husband dedicated decades to North Dakota in a career of public service.
“I am saddened by the current attorney general’s persistent campaign to malign Wayne’s legacy,” she said in a statement. “I’m proud of him, all he accomplished, and the integrity that Wayne brought to the ND Office of Attorney General.”
Mark Friese, Holmberg’s attorney, did not immediately respond to questions related to the call logs. Earlier this month, he declined to comment when asked about Holmberg’s connection to Stenehjem.
2015 report
Ahead of Holmberg’s sentencing, federal prosecutors revealed for the first time in a sentencing memorandum that a victim had come forward years earlier to report sexual exploitation. The man, who gave a victim impact statement at court, said “for reasons unknown to me” nothing ever came of his report. 
Mike Ness, a retired BCI agent, said in a statement he received a report from the FBI in 2015 or 2016 that a victim wanted to talk about sexual acts involving Holmberg, but the man wanted a letter of immunity.
Ness said he sent the information to the director of the BCI, which at the time was Dallas Carlson. Ness, who worked in the BCI’s Grand Forks office, said he also put the FBI in touch with a local state’s attorney.
Carlson said he does not remember whether the BCI received a report about Holmberg. 
“I’ve been racking my brain, and I just do not remember,” said Carlson, who is now the U.S. marshal for North Dakota. “Protocol at the time in a situation like this, it would have been ran through the attorney general.”
He added that sensitive cases were referred to the attorney general.
“I don’t recall a letter, to be quite honest, I do not recall a letter. And if there was a letter, which I don’t recall, it would have gone to Wayne,” Carlson said, referring to the former attorney general.
Former North Dakota lawmaker pleads guilty to traveling for sex with children

Jones, who was Grand Forks County state’s attorney at the time, kept handwritten notes about the information he received. A note dated July 29, 2015, identifies Holmberg as a suspect and indicates sexual assault allegations from the early 1990s in Grand Forks. The note mentions Holmberg’s role as a state senator and retired school counselor. Jones’ notes also indicate concerns about the statute of limitations.
The document also mentions that the man told investigators Holmberg is “not dealing with local boys” and was now going overseas. The note indicated that Holmberg’s travel was being tracked by the FBI.
Another note in the file indicates the FBI found the man’s report to be credible. “High probability he’s telling the truth,” the note says.
Jones worked with an assistant attorney general on a letter of immunity for the man. The man, who spoke during the sentencing hearing, said he took money from Holmberg at times in exchange for his silence. The North Dakota Monitor does not identify victims of sex crimes.
Acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer Klemetsrud Puhl said she looked into the man’s report but did not determine that a federal offense occurred, so she was unable to pursue it. 
At the time, she had a conversation with a BCI agent who told her the case had been referred to South Dakota for investigation, Klemetsrud Puhl said.
When Wrigley became attorney general, he said he also was told that the 2015 report about Holmberg had been referred to South Dakota for investigation.
But a spokesperson for the agency in the neighboring state that would have handled the referral — the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation — told the North Dakota Monitor the agency has no record of such a request.
Jones said his role was primarily to assist with the letter of immunity and he didn’t receive any additional law enforcement reports about Holmberg.
“I assumed that they were going to do their investigation and move it along, which obviously they did,” Jones said.
Child sex tourism fuels demand for human trafficking, expert says

Ness said the BCI was not asked to investigate. He said he later learned from a county official that the statute of limitations had expired.
But one allegation the man told the FBI involved a sexual assault that occurred in Bismarck in 2012, according to the prosecutors’ sentencing memo. It’s unclear if this information was shared with local authorities. Jones’ notes only mention the 1990s allegations.
A spokesperson for the FBI said the agency doesn’t comment on how it handles complaints.
Burleigh County State’s Attorney Julie Lawyer said her office has no record of Holmberg as a suspect at any time. The Bismarck Police Department has no record of any investigations involving Holmberg, said Lt. Luke Gardiner.
Lori Cohen, an attorney who leads the organization known as PACT, or Protect All Children from Trafficking, said she’s seen a pattern in which predators are often given a pass, particularly if the predator is in a position of power.
“There is a tendency to protect the predator rather than the victim, and that then allows the predator to continue to harm other victims,” Cohen said. “I think this conviction sends a message that it has to stop, but we need to stop it earlier. We need to stop it before more children are harmed.”
Klemetsrud Puhl said without the man’s early report about Holmberg, “it would have been very difficult to proceed” with the investigation that ultimately led to his federal conviction.
“He’s the first one that came forward and it was him affirmatively reporting to law enforcement about what happened at a time when nobody suspected anything,” she said.

(Dean Hanson/Albuquerque Journal)As an advocate for children in foster care and a former foster parent myself, I was heartened to see lawmakers prioritize reforms to the state’s Children, Youth, and Families Department (CYFD) during the recent legislative session, and grateful to see several critical reforms signed into law. These new laws will help bring much needed transparency, accountability, and oversight to the troubled agency, so it can better serve New Mexico’s kids and their families. 
But I am deeply troubled that Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham line-item vetoed crucial funding for one of these important reforms: the Office of the Child Advocate, a new, independent office that will oversee child well-being in the state.
Earlier this year, the governor pleasantly surprised me by acknowledging the need for significant change at CYFD in her State of the State speech. For several years now, her administration has resisted calls from advocates like me, members of the public, and lawmakers for greater oversight of the agency. I felt like maybe our calls were finally being heard. 
Since then, however, her words and actions tell a different story. While the governor signed the legislation creating this office, House Bill 5, she wrote a poison pen message as she did so, accusing those who championed the bill of pursuing a “vendetta” against her and attempting to “intimidate” CYFD staff. She even told a reporter that she was concerned the bill’s supporters were using children and families “as some sort of political effort to harm or discredit another elected official.” 
The harms we should be worried about are not political. Too many children have already paid the price for CYFD’s mistakes and failures. Too many kids have been harmed or even killed on CYFD’s watch. Those of us who are pushing for change are doing it for one reason only: to better protect our kids. 
While I know that most of the agency’s frontline staff are hardworking individuals who are dedicating their careers to helping kids, the agency has long been plagued by a culture of secrecy and defensiveness. That culture has undermined CYFD’s ability to accomplish its mission and resulted in a loss of public trust that makes it harder to hire new caseworkers and recruit foster families. 
The Office of the Child Advocate will help restore that trust by giving kids a stronger voice within the system that is supposed to keep them safe. The Child Advocate will investigate and resolve complaints from children and families involved with CYFD and report on the agency’s progress and challenges to help us understand what else needs to change. 
Legislators allocated $1 million dollars in this year’s $10.8 billion dollar state budget to help the Office of the Child Advocate get off the ground. That’s a small price to pay to improve the well-being of the most vulnerable children in our state and help CYFD begin to earn back our trust. 
Thankfully, New Mexico’s Attorney General has indicated that the state’s Department of Justice can help make up for the vetoed funding. By vetoing this funding and taking efforts to reform CYFD personally, the governor has only proven the necessity of outside oversight.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CYFD-1024x522.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

Shri Thanedar, D-Michigan, speaks at his election night party in Detroit on Aug. 6, 2024. The congressman filed impeachment articles against President Donald Trump on Monday.  (Ken Coleman/MIchigan Advance)This story originally appeared on Michigan Advance.

U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Michigan, brought seven articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on Monday, saying the president has “repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit to serve,” and “represents a clear and present danger to our nation’s constitution and our democracy.”
In a statement from Thanedar’s office, he pointed to “sweeping abuse of power, flagrant violations of the Constitution and acts of tyranny that undermine American democracy and threaten the rule of law” as his reasons for introducing the charges.
“[Trump’s] unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service. We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act,” Thanedar said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Each article alleges a separate violation of the Constitution, with Thanedar’s office offering the following breakdown of his resolution:

Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice.
Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds.
Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations.
Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech.
Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution.
Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain.
Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.

“This is not about partisanship. It’s about protecting our democracy and ensuring that no one, not even a President, is above the law,” Thanedar said in a statement.
Thanedar’s effort is likely to face an uphill battle in the House, where Republicans hold a seven seat majority. The Senate, which conducts the trial should the resolution receive a majority of votes in the House, is also held by Republicans, with a two-thirds vote needed in order to convict the president.
Thanedar’s introduction of the articles comes the same day that his second primary opponent, state Rep. Donavan McKinney, D-Detroit, announced he would seek his 13th District seat in the 2026 primary.
This is a breaking story and will be updated.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds’ lawsuit against the Des Moines Register is both unusual and dangerous for open government in Iowa.
Reynolds announced last week that she was filing suit seeking to stop the Register “from demanding production of the documents protected by executive privilege.”
That’s strange and alarming. Typically, a government agency – including this governor’s office – has simply denied requests for records they believed could be kept confidential (or just didn’t want to release). Until now, it’s been up to the requester, in this case, the Register, to decide whether it’s worthwhile to go to the time and expense of challenging a denial in court.

That was how it worked when Iowa Capital Dispatch and other media representatives and advocates sued the governor and her staff for withholding public records, in some cases as long as 18 months. The case went to the Iowa Supreme Court, which reinforced that the governor’s office is subject to Iowa’s Open Meetings and Records law and that indefinitely withholding public records was a violation.
In this new case, Reynolds is forcing the issue and dragging the Register into court over four emails and claiming “executive privilege” for refusing to release them.
The dispute relates to public statements Reynolds made about Lutheran Family Services, a not-for-profit organization engaged in refugee assistance.
Reynolds had been asked at a U.S. House Oversight Committee meeting whether she agreed with a former adviser to President Donald Trump, Michael Flynn, who claimed Lutheran Family Services was connected to a “money-laundering operation.”
Reynolds refused to respond directly at the hearing but days later, she said she “absolutely” did not agree with Flynn’s statement, according to the Register, and praised Lutheran Family Services for its charitable works.
According to the governor’s lawsuit, the Register requested emails to and from several of Reynolds’ advisers that referenced Lutheran Family Services. Reynolds’ office says it turned over more than 800 pages of documents, while withholding four documents that it said contained “candid, private advice and counsel from her most senior advisors.”
Because the governor did not send nor receive any of the emails, the Register argued that any executive privilege would not apply. The governor’s office claimed the Register’s position means that the governor “may not communicate with, or privately correspond with, her most senior advisors without those communications being open public records. That is not — and cannot be — the law.”
It’s not the law. There is absolutely nothing in Iowa law that prevents the governor from picking up the telephone or calling a meeting of her closest advisers and getting all the advice she might possibly want. But Iowa law does state that written communications among executive branch employees are public records. The governor’s office staff – and everyone working in the executive branch – should know this. There are over 60 exceptions in the law, none of which includes “executive privilege.”
The Reynolds administration is the least transparent in 30 years

That the governor is going to court over these four emails suggests there’s more at stake here than one or more of her staff disagreeing with her about a potentially politically charged issue. Reynolds has already announced she’s not running for reelection, so it’s hard to imagine what kind of response would be so explosive as to be worth a preemptive lawsuit to keep it secret.
More likely, Reynolds is trying to carve out or solidify some sort of “executive privilege” for the governor’s office through court precedent. But again, she’s leaving office at the end of next year, so why is that a priority?
The governor’s office statement casts the action as an effort to preserve the constitutional powers of the office: “It is unfortunate that state resources must be used to defend against the Register’s aggressive threats, but it is in the broader public interest to preserve the powers reserved in our constitution for the effective operation of government.”
Let’s be clear.  There’s nothing in the constitution about the governor keeping embarrassing emails secret. It was 100% the governor’s choice to spend public resources to initiate this lawsuit. And it is entirely in the broader public interest to have access to government documents and meetings – including those that may be embarrassing to elected officials.
By going to court against the Register for seeking public records, Reynolds is threatening all media that they may get sued for doing their job. Not all Iowa media outlets have the resources to withstand a taxpayer-funded lawsuit. It’s a direct attack on press freedom and therefore on the First Amendment.
Whether the governor’s lawsuit is successful or not, the citizens of Iowa will be the losers.

Jeff Bridges speaks before Gov. Jared Polis signs the budget for the 2025-2026 fiscal year on April 28, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the state’s $43.9 billion budget for the upcoming fiscal year on Monday, culminating nearly a year’s worth of work to craft a spending plan that appropriately funds public education and Medicaid while cutting enough program spending to fill a billion-dollar gap.
“A lot of hours and time went into writing this document. This balanced, bipartisan budget holds strong reserves for an uncertain future. It makes smart investments to protect what matters most, including education, public safety and health care,” Polis said during a signing ceremony at the Governor’s Residence in Denver.
The budget includes about $16 billion in general fund spending, the portion of the budget over which the Legislature has the most control. The new fiscal year begins in July.

The tight budget conditions were partially a product of ballooning Medicaid costs within the state’s Department of Health Care Policy and Financing and slowing inflation, which impacts how much tax revenue the state is allowed to retain and spend under the state constitution. A cap set by the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights will increase by about 3.6% next year but will be outpaced by health care costs.
That means the six bipartisan members of the powerful Joint Budget Committee had to figure out what to cut in order to create the constitutionally-required balanced budget.
“This is one of the most complicated budgets we have ever put together,” JBC Chair Sen. Jeff Bridges, an Arapahoe County Democrat, said.
Over 60 companion bills ran alongside the primary budget bill, known colloquially as the “long bill,” to shift spending and change state law to balance everything. Polis signed those last week.
More difficulties in future years
The budget makes spending reductions in about a dozen state departments.
One move delays about $70 million this year and $56 million next year in planned transportation spending. Another eliminates about $7 million for the Revitalizing Main Street program and over $70 million in awarded, though not under contract, grants for small-scale infrastructure improvements.
The budget also cuts or reduces many recently enacted programs, such as a Kidney Disease Task Force, free phone calls for incarcerated people, and a bullying-prevention effort in the Department of Education.
There are also instances where the budget bumps funding, including $150 million more to public schools and $21.7 million to the Child Care Assistance Program. It includes a 2.5% across-the-board salary increase for state employees and a 1.6% increase in the state reimbursement for Medicaid providers.
The budget funds the state’s universal free school meal program, approved by voters in 2022, until the end of the year. After that, the program’s financial future could be left to voters again if the Legislature refers to the fall ballot a measure asking to keep additional tax money to pay for the unexpected demand.
Lawmakers expect the difficult budget circumstances to continue in the upcoming years. Some attribute that to the constitutional limit of how much tax revenue the state can keep, and others say it is a spending problem that leads to a structural issue.
“You don’t get out of a structural deficit in a one-year budget. This is a two-, three- and four-year cycle that we have to work on and make sure that we are doing our due diligence,” said Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Weld County Republican.
“We had over $351 million of one-time spending again this year. That’s not good,” she said.
This year’s budget constraints left little room for any new programs and legislation that included spending.
The House voted 44-21 and the Senate voted 22-11 to approve the budget. The JBC’s two Republican members joined Democrats to vote in favor.

The Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education “will not seek to extend” Cheng’s contract beyond June 30, 2026, when it’s slated to end, according to a press release. Starting this July 1, Cheng will “transition” into a new role as a strategic advisor to the board as part of a mutual agreement, the press release stated.
Officials did not announce a replacement to succeed Cheng as the head of CSCU, which includes four public universities and over a dozen community colleges.
In a statement included in the press release, Cheng said, “I am incredibly proud of the work we have done to eliminate barriers to higher education, and increase educational access, equity, and opportunity for students, particularly for first-generation and minoritized students.
“Together, we have opened new doors for students and changed the trajectory of their lives,” Cheng’s statement went on. “I remain deeply committed to this work and will continue to work with the Board of Regents and build on the success of the CSCU system.”
The decision came after some deliberation, according to Gov. Ned Lamont. Speaking to reporters outside of the state Capitol Monday, Lamont said discussions between Cheng and the Board of Regents had been going on for “a while” prior to Monday’s announcement. The governor is responsible for appointing nine of the board’s 15 members, including its chair.
“Look, he’s been a good friend, he’s accomplished a lot there at Connecticut State,” the governor said, pointing specifically to the schools’ consolidation into a single higher education system in 2023, two years after Cheng was hired.
“Applications are up, graduations are up, but we just thought it was time to make a change,” Lamont added. “We did that together and to see if we can continue to speed up the process there.”
Cheng’s tenure also coincided with a time when many colleges are struggling with stagnant or declining enrollment, along with persistent questions about how much money the state should provide to support higher education. 
Those troubles worsened last year when CT Insider reported that the chancellor had charged tens of thousands of dollars to his state credit card on travel and meals — including chauffeured rides to and from his home in New York, despite his contract providing stipends for a car and apartment in Hartford.
A report from the Comptroller Sean Scanlon’s office later confirmed that many of those expenses exceeded certain limits, were missing receipts or violated other rules such a prohibition on purchasing alcohol with public money.
“At a time where we’re trying to manage within our budget, obviously some of the spending was an issue,” Lamont said Monday. “But for me, much more important is the direction of Connecticut State, what it’s going to look like in 10 years. And we’ve made good progress over the last four years, we still have a way to go.”
Marty Guay, the chair of the Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education, thanked Cheng for his service on Monday in another statement included in the system’s press release.
“The future is bright for CSCU as we look to set a new direction for the system,” Guay said. 
“We have a real opportunity to make impactful investments in our system in the best interests of the students we serve and the state as a whole,” he added. “We will continue to create more opportunities and access for students, boost graduation rates, and strengthen our talent pipelines to ensure they are aligned with industry needs and meet workforce demands.”
Richard Balducci, a former House speaker and member of the Board of Regents, said the board had been dissatisfied with the pace of change under Cheng and it was evident for months that his contract would not be renewed when it expired in June 2026.
Issues over Cheng’s personal spending solidified the consensus that a change was necessary, Balducci said. “That kind of set it off,” he said. 
“I think the Board of Regents should use this as an opportunity to refocus on what’s  really important, which is student outcomes, what’s happening in the classrooms,” said Rep. Gregg Haddad, D-Mansfield, who serves as co-chair of the Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee.
Lamont said Monday that the board already has an interim replacement for Cheng ready to announce following graduation ceremonies next month. However, the governor said he couldn’t recall the name of the person.
Samantha Norton, a spokeswoman for the system, said that an interim chancellor has not been selected by the board, “but we hope to make an announcement in the coming weeks.”
Cheng’s current contract is set to expire on June 30, 2026. Norton said Monday that Cheng will continue to earn his base annual salary of $442,187 until then.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0307_SR_CampusSurveillanceHearing_042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Fallout from the 2025 legislative session remains all over the news, reminding me of my brief time interacting with the Utah Legislature. It marked the most frustrating chapter of my academic and professional careers.
For the past school year I was able to be at the state Capitol during the recent session. I started out excited to cultivate relationships, have meaningful conversations and address important questions. By the end, I felt like an object of pity — and I realized the Legislature has failed to confront two major air quality issues: the literal pollution in our skies, and the air of arrogance within the Capitol each session.
My first interaction with a legislator was quite embarrassing. I patiently waited outside the House of Representatives chamber to talk with my representative about affordable housing.
When the chamber doors opened, my legislator waved in my direction. As we made our way towards each other, I reached out my hand, ready to introduce myself as a constituent. He brushed right past me to speak with someone else. Respectfully, I waited my turn. But after thanking the lobbyist for contributing to his campaign, he brushed past me again and disappeared. I felt my respect for the process disappear with him.
I’ve also spent two semesters interning in Washington, D.C. There was a stark difference between my experience at our state Capitol and my time working in D.C. While in D.C., I was able to meet with members of Congress from all over the country; every office had full-time staff, and several interns, who were quick to welcome constituents into their space for conversations.
I expected an even better experience with our state Legislature. I had always heard that our Legislature is approachable, efficient and constituent-friendly. “The legislative website is amazing!” “It’s easy to contact your legislator!” “Utah politics is so different!” But from my first interaction to my last, I found myself thinking, “Really? Did that just happen?”
Utah has a part-time legislature that meets for only 45 days each year and lawmakers have almost no professional staff. Every year we are shocked at the amount of bills they introduce and pass. But we should be more shocked by what this number says about the quality of those bills.
During committee hearings, it was clear that legislators had not read the bills they were meant to be vetting, much less understand their impact. Later, when the consequences hit their districts, legislators can just say, “well, we didn’t mean for that to happen.” But their affected constituents don’t get off the hook so easily.
There is also a purposeful lack of access-to information, to lawmakers, and to opportunities to be involved in positive policy change. By contrast, in D.C., it was so easy for me to connect with real people, find out about town halls, and get news from each district. While D.C. has its issues, I could clearly feel the passion and professionalism.
Our Legislature exudes an arrogance I did not experience in D.C. They seem to think themselves different from their constituents: more important, more worthy of respect. What I saw, does not back that up.
Our leaders seem determined to govern by nostalgia, as Utah continues to grow and experience new challenges. They cling to a vision of the nuclear family, market self-regulation, and rugged frontier individualism. Those images of “the Utah Way” haven’t been a reality for most Utahns for decades! Following “the Utah Way” and “disagreeing better” are not valid excuses for our legislature’s lack of professionalism and lack of access. They don’t justify ignoring the things Utahns need right now, and in the future.
When it comes to governance and leadership, we deserve better than just a balanced budget and tax cuts. We need something better than “what we’ve always done.” If that includes pushing past constituents to meet with donors, passing bills without serious review, or restricting public access-we should be coming up with a new “Utah Way,” and fast.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020625_HB267_12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Republicans on the House fraud prevention committee grilled Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on Monday over a 2021 meeting with people ensnared in the massive Feeding Our Future scandal, which took place just a month before the FBI shut down the fraud.
In a recently unearthed audio recording, Ellison can be heard agreeing with the Feeding Our Future participants that state agencies, i.e., his clients, are discriminating against East African state contractors. The recording was made — without Ellison’s knowledge — during his meeting with the vendors in December 2021. One month later, the FBI executed multiple search warrants on Feeding Our Future and other nonprofits. Federal prosecutors say the nonprofit and groups it sponsored fraudulently received $250 million in federal funds to feed hungry children during the pandemic, but the fraudsters used the money on luxury cars, real estate, jewelry and travel.
Republican members of the House Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight and Policy Committee asked Ellison to testify about why he seemed to be siding with the Feeding Our Future participants over the state agencies that were trying to stop the fraud.
Ellison said at the time he believed he was meeting with constituents and didn’t know they were involved in Feeding Our Future. After the 2021 meeting, Ellison said he spoke with his staff, who informed him that they were bad actors. Ellison said he didn’t do anything the Feeding Our Future participants asked of him and refused their fundraising help in the meeting.
“The proof of the pudding is in the tasting. What did I do for these people? Nothing. I investigated after the conversation, and then what did we do? We cooperated (with the federal government) to help get these people found accountable, as they eventually were,” Ellison said Monday.
Republicans on the fraud committee prepared clips of the recording and played them for Ellison, and asked him to respond to some of the most embarrassing parts. They questioned why he didn’t know the Feeding Our Future participants he met with, especially because his office had been representing the Department of Education in its legal battle with Feeding Our Future for about a year prior to the 2021 meeting.
Ellison painted himself as a politician doing run-of-the-mill constituent service and said that he doesn’t know every detail of all the cases his office is working on. He argued Republicans were being unrealistic by expecting him to know who the people were because Feeding Our Future and the fraud were at the time unknown.
“It’s impossible for any individual to know everything about every file that every agency does. It’s simply not how large organizations work. I have highly competent managers working on this … They knew, even if I didn’t know every single detail,” Ellison said. “What I knew was that people in the community said, ‘We feel like we’re not being treated fairly.’”
Republicans on the committee questioned the veracity of Ellison’s explanations, particularly that he didn’t know with whom he was meeting.
“I’ve got to believe that you were aware, unless your office is poorly run, which I don’t believe. I think it’s well-run,” Rep. Patti Anderson, R-Dellwood, told Ellison.
Democrats on the committee argued the hearing was a political hit job. Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, praised Ellison for his work prosecuting Medicaid fraud and said the committee should be focused on working to protect public dollars, not on nearly four-year-old recordings.
“If the work of this committee is actually serious and not political, what we should be asking is, what are we learning to ensure that we are protecting public funds?” Greenman argued.
Ellison closed his remarks Monday by assuring the committee that his office is committed to combatting fraudulent activity.
“I hope we can work together to fight waste, fraud and abuse,” Ellison told the committee. “I’m not naive. I know that we live in a political world, but if we can leave politics aside and try to figure out how to protect the public dollar, you have a partner in me.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MG_8541-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-28 19:27:21+00:00,CT Mirror,Boosting direct care hours at nursing homes would cost $24M,Jenna Carlesso and Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/28/ct-nursing-homes-direct-care-bill/,A bill that would increase how much time nursing home staff must spend with residents would cost $24M as CT is facing financial challenges.,"Legislators intent on boosting direct care for nursing home residents have recommended raising the daily minimum staffing requirement from three to 3.6 hours, a change that would provide about 36 minutes of additional care per resident each day.
But a recent analysis by the state’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis shows the move would come with a hefty price tag: $24.2 million, half of which would be picked up by the state through Medicaid payments.
“It’s going to be very difficult to pass this year,” said Sen. Jan Hochadel, D-Meriden, co-chair of the Aging Committee. “Unfortunately … we cannot afford [it] at this time.”
Hochadel said she continues to advocate for the measure, which her committee voted to advance in March, but “We have a rocky road.”
“This is something we have wanted to do, to increase staffing to take care of our elderly, but in this fiscal climate we have to make some hard choices,” Aging Committee Co-Chair Jane Garibay, D-Windsor, added.
Legislators are grappling with unprecedented challenges to state finances.
More than $500 million in emergency federal pandemic grants that are being used to fund ongoing programs will be unavailable going forward. A series of budget caps that have generated huge surpluses since 2017 have gradually weakened health care and other core programs and must be scaled back, Democratic legislative leaders say.
State officials’ largest concern, though, involves large anticipated reductions in federal aid in the coming months.
Under the staffing bill, nursing homes would be required to provide a minimum of 3.6 hours of direct care for each resident every day. They currently must provide three hours, though some homes already staff at higher levels.
Direct care is defined as hands-on care from a registered nurse, nurse’s aide or licensed practical nurse that includes feeding, dressing and bathing.
The measure also would impose new penalties for violations. Facilities that fail to comply with the increased staffing requirements could face fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill also gives the state health commissioner the authority to suspend a nursing home’s license or certificate or issue citations for lapses.
Nursing home industry leaders oppose the plan.
Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, said the cost is a challenge, as is recruiting staff.
“We have a reimbursement system where costs drive the rates. If you mandate increased costs to the facilities, those have to be reimbursed under the Medicaid program,” he said. “While that’s a challenge in any environment when there’s staffing shortages, it’s especially challenging to come up with the dollars to do it in the current fiscal climate.”
Earlier this year, he testified on the bill: “Because of the ongoing staffing shortages in the sector, nursing homes will inevitably need to unsatisfactorily rely, in increasing frequency, on temporary nursing staffing agencies in an attempt to comply with these highly prescriptive standards.”
Mag Morelli, president of LeadingAge Connecticut, which represents nonprofit nursing homes and adult care providers, said she supports strong staffing but worries about the expense.
“Right now, everyone is very concerned about how much they’re spending and potential cuts to the Medicaid program from the federal side,” she said. “There’s a shortage of workforce, so as one sector needs to increase staffing, it raises the cost of all staffing. There is a limited amount of people to go around in the health care sector.”
House Speaker Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, said the lack of clarity around federal Medicaid funding makes it difficult to back numerous proposals, including nursing home staffing increases.
“One of the most disappointing things as a state right now, for me, is the uncertainty at the federal level is impacting a lot of our Medicaid decisions,” he said. “Whether it’s an Aging Committee bill or the Medicaid caucus priority bill, we do need to wait for more information from Washington.”
Congress is trying to achieve savings in Medicaid and other programs worth $880 billion over 10 years to help pay for President Donald Trump’s proposed federal tax cuts.
Connecticut expects to spend $11.6 billion this fiscal year on Medicaid. About $4.7 billion of that is the state’s cost, with the other $6.9 billion covered by federal reimbursement.
But state officials fear that if Congress hits all or most of its cost-cutting target, Connecticut will lose hundreds of millions of dollars in annual support at best, billions at worst.
Along with the federal funding uncertainty, lawmakers also are confronting expired labor contracts for nursing facilities’ staff.
More than 6,000 nursing home employees spread among more than 60 facilities statewide are working with expired contracts. And another 3,500 health care workers, most assisting clients with disabilities in group homes, are due for wage hikes.
Though no specific work stoppage date has been announced, SEIU District 1199 New England — the state’s largest health care workers union — has said it wants legislators to expand Medicaid funding to support raises before the regular General Assembly session ends June 4.
“We also have a nursing home contract issue going on, so we have to balance all of the different bills relative to the industry,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee.
“We’ve got to get our arms around the nursing home industry and direct care. We’ve had [several] nursing homes close in the last 12 months. As we continue to move through this process, we have to remember that we want to still have nursing homes, and we’re going to have to grapple with the needs the industry has.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024_0222_SR_NursingHomes_126-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-28 19:20:00+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: Landlords outweigh renters in CT General Assembly,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/28/podcast-ct-general-assembly-landlords/,CT Mirror's Ginny Monk discusses her story about the nearly one in five members of the state legislature who are landlords.,"There are more landlords than renters in Connecticut’s General Assembly. How does that affect policy?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Ginny Monk to discuss her article, “Nearly 1 in 5 CT lawmakers are landlords. Could that affect policy?” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Ginny’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Ginny. Why did you decide to investigate whether being a landlord affects Connecticut lawmakers as they craft state housing policy?
GM: So this is something that particularly tenants’ rights advocates have asked me about every legislative session for the past couple of years, and I think this year in particular, we heard a lot of discussion from legislators about their personal experiences as landlords. So I decided to dig into it by looking at their financial disclosure reports.
WSHU: And what did you find?
GM: Based on the reporting from the financial disclosure reports, about one in five Connecticut lawmakers are also landlords, and this varies a lot in scale. So some folks only rent out one additional property. One rents out nearly 60 properties. And there was also sort of a variety in how thoroughly people filled out the forms. So some people listed LLCs that own rental properties, but didn’t list the individual properties on their forms. So there’s still a good deal unknown, but I think we are able to quantify at least a bit how many lawmakers are also landlords.
WSHU: You didn’t take into consideration that many lawmakers are lawyers who have landlords as clients as well, right?
GM: Right, so, many, many lawmakers are also lawyers, like you said, who have landlords as clients. We also didn’t count the number of people involved in real estate, which has some obvious ties to the landlord industry.
WSHU: Now you’ve talked to some of the lawmakers. What did they say?
GM: So it was really a wide variety of responses on how much lawmakers thought that this influenced policy. Some, particularly Democrats, said, yes, absolutely. This is influencing policy. It’s making it difficult to pass bills that are favorable to tenants. It’s watering down these bills. And then some said, of course, landlords should be lawmakers. They have expertise in providing housing.
WSHU: Yeah, you mentioned Rob Sampson (R-Cheshire), the ranking Republican on the committee, and he feels that his experience comes to bear when he makes his decisions, and it’s important to have that experience.
GM: Yeah, and he’s one who often mentions during particularly public hearings and public debates, his own experience as a landlord with some good tenants and some not-so-good tenants, and he’s opposed to many of the bills that tenant rights advocates have championed.
WSHU: Now tell us about the bills tenants’ rights advocates have championed and where they stand this year.
GM: Yeah, so particularly this year, they’re working on a bill that would reform eviction law in Connecticut. It would expand some existing protections that right now are only available to seniors and to people with disabilities. Essentially, it would end no-fault evictions. So these are evictions that typically occur at the end of the lease, and the expansion would apply to larger apartments, so five or more units. This is something they’ve worked on for the past couple of years. It hasn’t passed. This year, it’s gotten through committee. So we’ll see where it lands as we go to the full House and Senate over the next few weeks.
WSHU: You talked with Larry Butler, the Democrat. How’s he looking at it this year?
GM: Yeah, so Larry Butler is a long-standing member. He’s not the current chair of the Housing Committee. He was on one end of the spectrum, saying, you know, I didn’t realize that so many lawmakers are landlords, because I hardly ever hear about it, whereas the current chairs sort of said, you know, I hear about this more frequently.
WSHU: And right now, how does it look as far as passage of the tenants’ rights bills this year?
GM: Yeah, so it’s hard to say at this point. There seems to be a good amount of support, particularly from freshmen lawmakers. There’s a lot of support from folks who have historically been interested in housing and landlord-tenant issues, but there’s still a way to go. It got a couple of no votes from Democrats on the Housing Committee, which isn’t terribly common, and Republicans have been really staunchly against this bill.
WSHU: If this passes, would it be a first for the nation? Is this the first of this kind of bill, or do we have similar bills in other states?
GM: There are similar bills in other states, and I think that’s one of the points that advocates are making to folks who say this would drastically change the landscape of the rental industry in Connecticut. They’re saying other states have done this and made it through, and Connecticut already offers these protections to select groups of renters.
WSHU: Those are the associations that have this provision.
GM: Yeah, there are certain Connecticut folks over 62 and people with disabilities as well as the people that are caring for them, who are not subject to no-fault eviction.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/assembly-24.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) The Iowa Board of Medicine has charged an emergency-medicine doctor from Des Moines with sexual misconduct.
Board records indicate Dr. Douglas Selover, 67, has been charged with unprofessional conduct, a charge that includes acts that violate the “standards and principles of medical ethics,” or are “contrary to honesty, justice or good morals, whether the same is committed in the course of the licensee’s practice or otherwise.” Selover is also charged with sexual misconduct, a charge the board says “includes sexual harassment.”
The board has not disclosed when, where or how the alleged violations took place. State records indicate Selover has practiced as an emergency-medicine physician at MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center.
A board hearing on the charges is scheduled for Dec. 12, 2025.
Board records show that in 1991, the board approved Selover’s residency in Iowa pursuant to a consent agreement in which he agreed to abstain from the use of nonprescribed drugs, inform his treating physician of his “previous history of chemical abuse,” and abstain from drinking alcohol. As part of that agreement, Selover also promised to attend regular support-group meetings and submit to periodic testing for drugs and alcohol.
In 1992, shortly after Selover was arrested on a charge of drunken driving, the board alleged that on several occasions Selover had violated the terms of his consent agreement by consuming alcohol. Later that year, the board resolved the case by suspending Selover’s license for 30 days, after which his license was to be placed on probationary status for five years. The arrest resulted in a conviction for second-offense drunken driving, according to court records.
In 1993, the board granted Selover a license to practice osteopathic medicine in Iowa subject to probation and many of the same conditions that were imposed on his residency in 1991. In 1996, the board terminated Selover’s probation and granted him a license free and clear of any restrictions.
In November 2003, Selover was arrested again on a charge of second-offense drunken driving. The charge was later reduced to reckless driving.
Selover is currently a defendant in two separate medical malpractice cases in which he is alleged to have failed to diagnose hydrocephalus in patients he saw seven days apart at MercyOne Medical Center of Des Moines. Both patients — one of whom was a 7-year-old boy, while the other was a 12-year-old girl — subsequently died.
Selover has denied any wrongdoing in the two cases, which are currently scheduled for trial in July and September of 2027.



Dubuque physician faces charges again
The Iowa Board of Medicine has charged a Dubuque physician with unprofessional conduct.
Board records indicate Dr. Barry J. Waack, 59, a doctor of osteopathy, is charged with unprofessional conduct, a charge that includes acts “contrary to honesty, justice or good morals, whether the same is committed in the course of the licensee’s practice or otherwise,” or acts that violate “the standards and principles of medical ethics or rules.”
The board has not disclosed when, where or how the alleged violations took place. According to the board, Waack is a family-medicine physician practicing in the Dubuque area.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Oct. 24, 2025.
In 2018, the board alleged Waack violated appropriate professional boundaries, engaged in improper prescribing, and failed to establish an appropriate physician-patient relationship. The board also alleged Waack failed to perform appropriate examinations and failed to maintain appropriate medical records.
In that case, Waack was accused of prescribing multiple medications — including antibiotics, a corticosteroid and an antidepressant — for a subordinate female coworker with whom he was having a sexual relationship, without ever establishing an appropriate physician-patient relationship.
He and the board later agreed to resolve the case with a warning and a $5,000 civil penalty. As part of the agreement, Waack also agreed to complete a board-approved course on professional boundaries, and his license was placed on probation.
In December 2021, the board restored Waack’s license to full privileges, free and clear of any restrictions.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DOCTOR.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Hundreds filed past the message “Rest in Peace Pope Francis” on the reader board outside St. Anthony Church in North Providence Monday on their way inside to honor the late Rhode Island Senate President Dominick Ruggerio.
Comparisons between the two titans of their worlds — Ruggerio, of state politics, and Francis of the Catholic Church — were unavoidable during the Mass in celebration of Ruggerio.
Both died on April 21. Ruggerio was 76, and Pope Francis was 88.
The Rev. Edward Cardente, who led Ruggerio’s funeral Mass, called it a “double whammy.”
“Just as Pope Francis was known throughout the world, so was Senate President Ruggerio known throughout the state of Rhode Island,” Cardente said.
Indeed, the crowd for Ruggerio’s Mass spilled out from the Mineral Spring Avenue church, filling a room in the rectory set up with projector screens and folding chairs. Cars lined the streets of the neighborhood around the church, as family, friends, elected officials, judges and union leaders from across the country gathered to pay their respects.
The attendee list included North Providence Mayor Charles Lombardi, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, Gov. Dan McKee, Rhode Island’s congressional delegation and former U.S. Commerce Secretary and former Gov. Gina Raimondo, who traveled from D.C. to attend the funeral.  
“Donny was special, a dear friend,” Raimondo said in comments after the Mass. “We argued a lot. We probably disagreed more than we agreed. But he was always so respectful, a true gentleman.”
The pair of LaSalle Academy alumni, though both Democrats, differed on hot-button social issues like guns and reproductive rights during their overlap on Smith Hill. Raimondo served as governor from 2015 to 2021.
Ruggerio, a former administrator for the Laborers’ International Union of North America representing construction workers, was first elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives in 1980. He served two terms before he successfully ran for the Senate, where he represented District 4, spanning northern Providence and North Providence, for the next four decades. He was elected Senate president by his colleagues in 2017. 
Ruggerio was known for more conservative stances on social issues, while championing worker protections and expanding legal gambling. But colleagues remembered Ruggerio’s willingness to listen to views other than his own, and to change his views as time progressed.

‘Indestructible’
Ruggerio’s son, Charles Ruggerio, said his dad’s once formidable demeanor toward his family eased in his later years, too. In a remembrance given during the Mass, Charles Ruggerio described his father as “indestructible” and “old-school.”
“What he struggled to express in words, he demonstrated in actions,” Charles Ruggerio said of his dad, recalling the countless sports games, graduations and other celebratory events his father attended for his children. 
But, as time went on, the elder Ruggerio’s hard facade softened, and his outward displays of affection towards his family, especially his grandchildren, were numerous.
“It was rare for him to end a phone call without saying ‘I love you,’” Charles Ruggerio said of his dad in his later years. 
The late Senate president was known as a mentor to his colleagues at the State House, eager to pass on the knowledge and expertise he’d developed as the most senior member of the Rhode Island General Assembly and the “dean” of the Senate.
Despite the public nature of his life in politics, Ruggerio kept his personal life, including his health, private even to his family. Charles Ruggerio recalled a family trip to Disneyland Paris five years ago; his father kept up with his grandchildren despite being 71 years old, and having cancer — a diagnosis Charles Ruggerio didn’t know about at the time.
“He had cancer at least three times that I was aware of,” Charles Ruggerio said.
When Ruggerio publicly revealed he was again battling cancer in April 2024, amid visible signs of decline, he refused to say what kind, or when he had been diagnosed. This year, as illness forced Ruggerio to miss a majority of the Senate’s floor sessions, his aides continued to tout his recovery and promised an imminent return to the chamber.
Concern over Ruggerio’s ability to lead the Senate given his health problems divided Democratic lawmakers, with nearly one-third backing Sen. Ryan Pearson for Senate president over Ruggerio in a November caucus. 
Ruggerio’s death has reopened the freshly healed wounds from the contentious leadership battle. Pearson is again vying for the president role while Ruggerio’s second-in-command, Senate Majority Leader Valarie Lawson, has teamed up with Sen. Frank Ciccone as a slate for president and majority leader, respectively.

Leadership elections Tuesday
The Senate, which has been on hiatus since Ruggerio’s death, is expected to elect its new president tomorrow afternoon, Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson said. A party caucus will be held prior to the full Senate session, which is tentatively scheduled for 4:30 p.m.
Lawson, Ciccone and Pearson all attended Ruggerio’s funeral, along with the rest of the chamber and members of the House of Representatives. Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat and friend of Ruggerio, said the “Prayer of the Faithful” during the Mass.
Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, declined to comment after the Mass.
Pearson, who had a falling out with Ruggerio last year, said he did not hesitate to attend Ruggerio’s funeral.
“Donny was my friend for over 15 years,” Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat, said after the Mass. “Of course, I am here.”
Asked about the comparisons with Pope Francis, Pearson said, “Donny would be loving that.”
Charles Ruggerio also acknowledged the associations between his father and the leader of the Catholic Church.
“He would say, ‘always the bridesmaid, never the bride,’” Charles Ruggerio joked.
“But we know that couldn’t be further from the truth after seeing the tremendous outpouring of love this past week.”
Ruggerio passed the Rhode Island State House one last time around 1 p.m., as his funeral procession drove east on Smith Street en route to St. Francis Cemetery in Pawtucket. 
A handful of state workers started gathering around 12:30 p.m. on the walkway outside the State House. The group swelled to a large crowd, including senators who arrived by bus following the funeral Mass, in time to watch the motorcade pass. 
A lifelong North Providence resident, Ruggerio is survived by his children, Charles and Amanda; his sister Lisa Aceto; and his grandchildren, Ava, Mia, Natalie, and Jameson.

With the addition of the omissions and other accounting adjustments, the base budget’s corrected total is $426,732 more than initially calculated, according to administrators and their updated spreadsheet.As a result, the town selectboard will have to cut nearly a half-million dollars from the new number just to level down to the 12% tax hike defeated last month, leaders have determined.“The budget news is really disappointing,” selectboard Chair Elizabeth McLoughlin said at the start of a special Thursday session on the topic.Five and a half hours later, the board asked Town Manager John Potter to return this week with a plan to cut $500,000 in expenses for the fiscal year that starts July 1. That would allow leaders to present a revised proposal at a special Town Meeting on May 27 that’s lower than the original, if only by about $75,000.“The numbers have been corrected and our task has gotten way more difficult,” selectboard Vice-Chair Oscar Heller said.Heller, newly elected to the board, headed the town’s advisory Finance Committee this winter when it issued a rare public resolution questioning why local leaders, facing double-digit-percentage increases in staffing, health insurance and trash disposal costs, weren’t studying decreases in the biggest single source of spending: personnel.READ MORE





 


In a first, Brattleboro Town Meeting rejects proposed municipal budget

“We recognize that the concept of staff cuts is painful,” the committee said in its statement, “but we believe that considering it is an essential part of the responsible management of the town.” The selectboard at the time — which lost three of its five members in March when the former chair didn’t run for reelection and two incumbents were defeated — chose not to reduce employees. On Thursday, continuing board member Peter Case, who has opposed layoffs, asked how the town would achieve $500,000 in savings.Replied Potter: “It’s going to come from positions.”And McLoughlin: “Nothing is off the table.”The selectboard is scheduled to receive and review proposed reductions at a special session this Thursday. Leaders so far have chosen not to fill two open administrative jobs: assistant town manager and finance director. But they are considering the addition of three firefighters after determining that station overtime is so high — currently upward of $700,000 or more annually — that hiring help would be less expensive.“I don’t see any way to reduce that number,” new Fire Chief Jay Symonds said of the overtime spurred by vacancies and contract requirements, “other than adding staff.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brattleboro rejected a $25M municipal budget as too high.

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Just two years after Minnesota became the first state to extend unemployment insurance to school bus drivers, cafeteria workers and teachers’ aids, Democratic legislators are considering eliminating the benefit after summer 2028 to reach a budget deal with Republicans.
The law continues to face stiff opposition from school districts, which say paying for unemployment benefits for hourly school workers takes critical funding away from the classroom while making it harder for them to find workers to fill part-time summer positions.
Advocates say the benefit provides a critical lifeline to workers, who make around $17 an hour, while helping school districts retain experienced staff year after year.
The Republican and DFL co-chairs of the House Education Finance Committee on Monday presented a budget agreement (HF1388) that provides additional funding for school districts to pay for unemployment benefits in the coming year but repeals the benefits in four years.
Democrats tried to amend the education budget bill to maintain unemployment benefits for hourly school workers, but the effort failed on a tie vote in the evenly divided committee. The budget was then laid over to be taken up by the House Ways and Means Committee.
House Education Finance Committee Co-Chair Rep. Cheryl Youkim, DFL-Hopkins, called agreeing to eliminate the benefits her “biggest disappointment” during Monday’s hearing and said she hopes they can find a way to retain it going forward.
Setting the repeal date so far in the future means Democrats could reverse course again and keep the benefits going if they win back control of government.
But some Democrats say they aren’t willing to vote for the deal and bank on a strong election in 2026, which means the issue could divide the DFL House and Senate caucuses and become a key sticking point in budget negotiations over the next three weeks.
The Legislature is set to adjourn May 19; they need to pass a budget by June 30 to keep the government open.
More than half a dozen House Democrats held a news conference on Friday with hourly school workers during which they blasted Republicans for demanding a repeal of the benefits long afforded other seasonal workers like those in construction.
“This is a line-in-the-sand moment for Democrats,” said Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, who authored the bill in the 2023 legislative session.
Kristen Scott, who’s worked as a special education paraprofessional for 20 years in the Elk River School District, said the unemployment benefits have helped her stay afloat during the summer months, when full-time work in schools is hard to come by.
“It also allows us to continue to come back each year to do the important job of helping all of our children thrive,” Scott said. “Cutting unemployment benefits will force many in my field to seek other full-time jobs, leaving our kids wondering who will be there to care for them year after year.”
School districts haven’t had to pay anything toward unemployment benefits because the Minnesota Legislature created a $135 million fund to cover the costs until 2027 or the funds ran out.
Benefits cost an estimated $45 million in 2023 and $57 million in 2024, according to the Minnesota Department of Education. That leaves about half of what’s expected to be needed to pay for the benefits this summer.
Gov. Tim Walz has proposed shoring up the fund with $30 million for this summer to help districts cover the cost, and a DFL-led Senate proposal would provide an additional $70 million the following year.
After that, school districts would have to factor in the cost of unemployment into their regular budgets.
Greenman said they passed the bill in 2023 with the expectation that school districts would eventually pick up the cost without state aid.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-67-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) WEST DES MOINES — Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig announced Monday the state agriculture department invested in 14 urban water quality projects, including one that backs up to the historic Jordan House where he spoke. 
The project in West Des Moines will add bioretention cells, or rain gardens, native plants and a stormwater wetland to the Legacy Woods Nature Sanctuary, as part of its plan to expand to include trails and recreation for the public. This will help to capture and clean stormwater runoff before it reaches Jordan Creek and Raccoon River. 
“Our investment, on the part of the department, is focused on water quality, but we know that projects like this also provide other values for the community, and we love those layered benefits of education and recreation and cultural preservation,” Naig said.

He said the cost-share grants announced are another way to adhere to the state’s Nutrient Reduction Strategy and said visible urban projects like the one at Legacy Woods can be inspiring to visitors. 
“I hope it’ll inspire folks who spend time here to consider what they might do on their own property, but also other cities can come and see how this can be incorporated into the landscape,” Naig said. 
Russ Trimble, mayor of West Des Moines, said he was proud of his city’s continued efforts to improve and preserve its natural resources. 
“Water quality improvements aren’t just the responsibility of rural Iowa farmers,” Trimble said. “It’s incumbent upon all of us to do our part to clean up and improve our water.” 
The grants cover up to 50% of each of the 14 projects and are funded, in part, through the state Water Quality Initiative. IDALS invested $250,000 into the wetland project in West Des Moines and overall invested nearly $2.7 million for all of the projects. 
Including the local matches, the urban water quality projects will leverage more than $5.7 million for projects located in: Algona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Cedar Rapids, Clear Lake, Clinton, Decorah, Des Moines, Dunlap, Durant, Evansdale, Mount Ayr, Oskaloosa and West Des Moines.
Projects range from adding permeable parking lots and pavers to infrastructure, landscaping with oxbows and rain gardens or using native species and wetlands to filter runoff water. 
Naig made the announcement during Iowa Soil and Water Conservation week, and said all Iowans have a role to play in soil and water conservation, regardless of where they live or what type of property they own.  
“There’s certainly more work to do, but we’re seeing progress towards achieving our Nutrient Reduction Strategy goals,” Naig said. “Projects like this make a difference.”

Shri Thanedar speaks at his election night party in Detroit on Aug. 6, 2024 | Ken ColemanMichigan Congressman Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) on Monday brought seven articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, saying the president has “repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit to serve,” and “represents a clear and present danger to our nation’s constitution and our democracy.”
In a statement from Thanedar’s office, he pointed to “sweeping abuse of power, flagrant violations of the Constitution and acts of tyranny that undermine American democracy and threaten the rule of law” as his reasons for introducing the charges. 
“[Trump’s] unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service. We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act,” Thanedar said. 
Each article alleges a separate violation of the Constitution, with Thanedar’s office offering the following breakdown of his resolution:

 Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice.
Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds.
Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations.
Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech.
Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution.
Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain.
Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.

“This is not about partisanship. It’s about protecting our democracy and ensuring that no one, not even a President, is above the law,” Thanedar said in a statement. 
Thanedar’s effort is likely to face an uphill battle in the House, where Republicans hold a seven seat majority. The Senate, which conducts the trial should the resolution receive a majority of votes in the House, is also held by Republicans, with a two-thirds vote needed in order to convict the president. 
Thanedar’s introduction of the articles comes the same day that his second primary opponent, state Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit), announced he would seek his 13th District seat in the 2026 primary.

Collectively, they form the financial linchpin to the state’s next budget and would generate the revenue needed to erase a chunk of a shortfall Ferguson has pegged at $16 billion over the next four fiscal years. The tax package is expected to net around $9.4 billion over that time.
Democrats drew up the bills. They used their majorities in the House and Senate to pass them over the opposition of Republicans and a few moderate Democrats.
It is not known if the first-term Democratic governor will sign them all. He rejected Democrats’ recent $12 billion package as unsustainable and too risky.
Before that, Ferguson stated his objections publicly to relying on a novel wealth tax that was an original cornerstone of Democratic lawmakers’ approaches. So it got set aside.
He shared his dislike privately of raising the cap on annual property tax growth. It disappeared. As did a payroll tax on large companies.
Below is a breakdown of five tax bills heading to the governor, which would help pay for spending in the two-year $77.8 billion state operating budget lawmakers approved. These measures do not cover the slate of tax and fee increases legislators are relying on for the separate transportation budget.
House Bill 2081 is the most far-reaching, affecting an estimated 191,000 taxpayers, per the latest fiscal analysis. It is projected to bring in the most money of the tax bills, nearly $2.1 billion for the next budget and $5.6 billion over four years. That covers roughly a third of the shortfall.
It permanently increases the state’s two primary business and occupation tax rates on gross proceeds — 0.471% and 0.484% — to 0.5%, starting Jan. 1, 2027. Another provision of House Bill 2081 boosts the tax rate for service businesses with annual taxable revenue exceeding $5 million from 1.75% to 2.1%. 
Financial institutions with annual net income of $1 billion or more would see the rate for an additional tax they pay rise from 1.2% to 1.5% starting Oct. 1. This will impact about 200 businesses, Democrats have said. 
About 400 corporations with more than $250 million in annual revenue would be subject to a 0.5% surcharge for three years starting Jan. 1, 2026. That extra would be levied on amounts above the $250 million threshold. Among those exempted from that surcharge is Boeing. 
There’s also a major change in a levy on technology companies that goes directly toward higher education, including student financial aid. The “advanced computing surcharge” applies to firms with global revenue above $25 billion — think Microsoft and Amazon. It would raise the tax rate from 1.22% to 7.5% and boost a cap on payments from $9 million to $75 million. 
Senate Bill 5814, the other major money-maker for the state, is counted on to raise $1.1 billion for the next budget and $2.7 billion over four years. It would do so by applying the retail sales tax to more services, such as temporary staffing, advertising, security and lobbying. The change would occur Oct. 1 and affect an estimated 35,000 firms, according to a Department of Revenue analysis.
It also contains a provision to begin taxing certain products with nicotine, like Zyn pouches. If it becomes law, this new tax takes effect Jan. 1, 2026.
And an estimated $1.1 billion will flow into coffers of local governments around the state since they receive a share of sales tax.
Senate Bill 5813 will add a layer to the capital gains tax. In addition to the existing 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets like stocks, bonds and business interests, the bill tacks on another 2.9% for gains exceeding $1 million. About 900 taxpayers would be impacted.
The bill also makes revisions in the state’s estate tax — a tax on the right to transfer property at the time of death. Rates would increase, but the value of property excluded from the tax would climb to $3 million, up from the current $2.1 million. Lawmakers assume this legislation will generate $321.6 million for the next budget, and slightly less in the one after that.
Senate Bill 5794 seeks to bring in revenue by getting rid of tax breaks that the Department of Revenue estimates are used by 15,000 taxpayers. These changes are counted on to bring in $148.5 million for the next budget, according to budget documents.
Among the many tax preferences targeted for elimination are ones exempting sales of precious metal bullion. Another change would make operators of self-service storage facilities begin to pay taxes on the renting or leasing of individual units.
House Bill 2077 would begin taxing the sale of electric vehicle credits between automakers. This has been dubbed the “Tesla tax” because the firm led by Elon Musk is the only automaker with credits to sell in Washington. This brand-new tax is projected to generate $54.5 million for the operating budget.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/money-closuep-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

Keith Jackson, a Democratic lawmaker from Kemper County, can remain in office despite a felony indictment by participating in a pre-trial intervention program, according to court documents. 
A grand jury last year indicted Jackson, a first-term House member, on charges of receiving stolen property – specifically, a 2006 Magnolia timber trailer worth about $15,000. The grand jury also indicted two other people, Fredwrick (sic) Young and William Tate, in connection with the criminal charges. 
Jackson did not respond to a request for comment, and his attorney, Christopher Collins, declined to comment. 
Cassie Colman, the district attorney in the 10th circuit district, told Mississippi Today that the state agreed to let Jackson participate in pretrial intervention because he had no prior criminal record. If Jackson completes the terms of the pre-trial agreement, then the criminal charges will be expunged from his record. 
Going to trial would likely be risky for the lawmaker because, if convicted of the offense, he could lose the right to hold elected office. 
Receiving stolen property is a disenfranchising crime in Mississippi, and if someone is convicted of a disenfranchising crime, they lose their right to vote. To run for office in Mississippi, someone must be a registered voter. 
But Coleman, who prosecuted the case against Jackson, said the legislator’s agreement to enter the program is neither a guilty plea nor a conviction. Instead, he will enroll in the intervention program for at least a year and pay around $3,350 in fees, according to court documents. 
If he fails to meet the terms of the agreement, the district attorney could remove him from the program and prosecute him for the original crime.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/28134326/jackson_45th.jpg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, in regard to comments by Michigan’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin.
Speaking Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press”, Sanders was asked about Slotkin’s suggestion in an interview with Politico that Democrats needed to fight back against the perception that they are “weak and woke” and stop using the term “oligarchy” when criticizing Trump and his allies, such as billionaire Elon Musk, and instead say they are opposed to “kings.”

“Well, jeez, we had 36,000 people out in Los Angeles, 34,000 people in Colorado. We had 30,000 people in Folsom, California, which is kind of a rural area,” Sanders said, referencing recent “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies he and fellow progressive, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), has hosted in opposition to Trump administration policies.
“I think the American people are not quite as dumb as Ms. Slotkin thinks they are,” Sanders said.
A request for comment was made to Slotkin’s office by the Michigan Advance, but has yet to be returned.
Slotkin, who won her Senate seat in 2024 by less than 20,000 votes out of more than 5 million cast, has made her political career out of winning tight races in districts and states that otherwise supported Trump.
Her rising star in the party was exemplified by Slotkin’s selection to give the Democratic response to Trump’s address to Congress in March.

However, in his “Meet the Press” interview, Sanders, who drew an estimated 10,000 supporters in early March to Lincoln High School in Warren, Michigan, said an acknowledgment was necessary about the nature of the forces championing policies that have deepened the nation’s economic inequality.   
“The very rich getting richer, working class people are struggling, 800,000 people sleeping out on the streets. If we don’t address that issue, the American people will continue to turn their backs on democracy because they’re looking around them and they’re saying, ‘Does anybody understand what I am going through?’ And unfortunately, right now, to a large degree, neither party does,” Sanders said.
Slotkin, posting on the social media platform X on Friday, said Democrats needed more than rhetoric if they hope to win against Republicans.
“After this 100 days of the Trump Administration, we owe the nation a plan: reclaiming our patriotism, a real economic plan for the Middle Class, and a fight for our democracy that recognizes the stakes,” Slotkin wrote.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AMR_0240-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

The portal[...],"South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden reads the title of a bill he signed in Sioux Falls on March 17, 2025. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)State employees in South Dakota will soon have a secure web portal to submit allegations of misbehavior by their coworkers.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order telling the state Bureau of Human Resources and Administration and the Bureau of Information and Telecommunications to create a “secure standard reporting mechanism” for employees. The portal will deliver reports of malfeasance to the state’s auditor and attorney general.
The order also requires supervisors and encourages employees to submit such reports, and directs the human resources department to conduct training in ethics and use of the portal.
The order is an outgrowth of Senate bills 62 and 63, which tightened the state’s internal controls after a series of 2024 scandals involving former state employees. 
Governor prevails in dispute over penalties for supervisors who stay silent on misdeeds

One such employee, Lonna Carroll, used her position at the Department of Social Services to illegally collect nearly $1.8 million over the course of 13 years. A jury found Carroll guilty of grand theft earlier this month.
Other former employees stood accused of forging vehicle registrations, falsifying food service inspections and using foster family food service vouchers for themselves.
Representatives for Rhoden and Attorney General Marty Jackley sparred during the 2025 legislative session over whether supervisors should face felony charges for failure to report state employee misdeeds. 
Rhoden’s office argued supervisors should face misdemeanor rather than felony charges, particularly if the unreported employee misbehavior isn’t felonious in nature. The kerfuffle over that provision in SB 62 forced multiple rounds of debate, one of which appeared to doom the bill before a revival effort the following day. In the end, lawmakers narrowly sided with Rhoden.
In a press release announcing the creation of the online reporting system, Rhoden wrote that the executive branch took “decisive action” to address the rash of corruption cases.
“Under my leadership, South Dakota will have a government that is accountable and responsible with taxpayer dollars, and this executive order is an important step forward,” he wrote.

“I take issue with what was said last week,” she told her Democratic colleagues at the beginning of the Senate’s business on Monday afternoon. “We may not hold the majority, but we have something just as powerful — a vision, rooted in fairness, in justice, in equality, and in care.”
Her caucus elected Berman on Thursday afternoon, shortly after Pizzo stunningly announced on the floor of the Senate that he was leaving the Florida Democratic Party and would instead become a non-party-affiliated (NPA) voter.
“I am very disappointed about the way things unfolded last week,” Berman acknowledged in a conference call with reporters earlier in the day. 
“I can’t believe with one week left in session we had this huge disruption. But I am moving on, and I think that’s what we in the Democratic Party need to do. I feel that our Democratic Caucus here in the Senate — ‘The Tenacious Ten’ — we are more unified than ever. We are ready to finish this session strong. We are ready to make sure our Democratic values get heard in the bills that we pass. We will be fighting bad bills. We will be making sure that we get appropriations that are impactful for our districts at home.”
She added that she considers herself a unifier.
“I want all my members to shine, and that is going to be my goal, to make sure that each member of our caucus has the opportunity to move forward and do the job that we were are all elected to do, to represent the people of our districts.”
Pizzo’s resignation was the latest in a series of devastating blows that the Florida Democratic Party has suffered in recent years. The party fell into superminority status in both the state House and Senate after the 2022 elections — in which its candidates for governor lost by 19 points and for U.S. Senate by 16 points.
A year earlier, the Republican Party for the first time took the lead in voter registrations in Florida, a lead that has since increased to more than 1.2 million voters. Then, after the Democrats failed to win back any new seats in the Legislature last fall, they saw their numbers in the Florida House dwindle by two more last December to just 33 in the 120-member body after Hillsborough County Rep. Susan Valdés, and then South Florida’s Hillary Cassel, announced that they were ditching the Democrats to go Republican.
Criticism
With Pizzo’s departure and the death of Orange County Sen. Geraldine Thompson before the session began in March, there are now just 10 Democrats in the 40-member Senate.
In announcing his resignation, Pizzo said that the “Florida Democratic Party is dead,” adding that “there are good people that can resuscitate it, but they don’t want it to be me.”
Pizzo added more criticism of his now-former party over the weekend.
“I’ve spent thousands of hours trying to resuscitate something that’s just not there, and we just got so consumed with taking the bait and the opportunity cost lost with going ahead and going down a rabbit hole of socially divisive issues that — there was no plan. If you go on whether it’s the state [web] site or a local site as it relates to party, there’s no policies. There’s no plan,” Pizzo said in an interview aired Sunday on WPLG television in Miami. “There’s just a lot of anger and a lot of hate — which I understand, because it’s been a generation of Republican control.”
Berman and House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell disputed that assessment.
“Unfortunately, we had to be reactive in past years because there were so many bad bills that came through and so much policy that you had to react to, but I think we clearly have an agenda,” Berman said. “Our agenda is to help the working people here in the state of Florida. To make sure that people can get access to health care. To support public education. To make sure that we have a clean environment for everyone to flourish.”
Driskell said that in fact what she calls the party’s “platform bills” have been focused on making life better for everyday Floridians, not on culture war issues.
“They focused on making housing more affordable,  expanding Medicaid so we can help health care be more affordable for all of us, protecting our drinking water and our natural resources. Focusing on commonsense gun solutions, gun reform. … We focus on protecting workers, we focus on investing in our kids in terms of public education, so those are the issues that we center on, but please understand that, as a party of opposition, where we have to stand up and fight for the Constitution and fight for the least among us, we will do it at every time.”
Hope Florida
Berman and Driskell later focused on developments in the saga revolving around Hope Florida, the welfare program started by First Lady Casey DeSantis, which has dominated the second half of the legislative session in terms of news coverage.
A House committee announced last week that it was ending its investigation into reports of $10 million going to the Hope Florida Foundation from a state Medicaid overpayment settlement. Much of that $10 million was later sent to a political committee run by James Uthmeier, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ former chief-of-staff (now state attorney general), that was working to combat last year’s referendum on recreational cannabis.
“I don’t think this issue will fade,” Berman said, “because when everybody goes home to their districts over the summer, they are going to hear about this issue and I really believe that … we need to continue to investigate this issue. It should not be allowed to go without a response, whether it’s a legal response or whether it’s a political response, but we should never allow this kind of graft to happen in our state of Florida.”
Boca Raton Democratic Rep. Kelly Skidmore said that Gov. DeSantis certainly hopes that the controversy over Hope Florida will fade.
“That is why he is going so hard after his own Republican colleagues, because he wants them to be afraid and not focused on this fraud that was perpetrated on taxpayers.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/0-1-1024x598.png,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

(Image via Maine Legislature live stream)A Republican lawmaker who had been censured by her legislative peers for posting personal information about a transgender student on her official social media account is taking her fight to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Rep. Laurel Libby of Auburn said she filed the petition Monday after the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied her motion for an expedited appeal to end the censure by the Maine House of Representatives.
“For over 60 days, my constituents have had no say in actions taken by their government, actions that directly impact their lives,” Libby said in a press release. “Every vote taken on the floor of the legislature is a vote my constituents cannot get back. The good people of our district have been silenced and disenfranchised.”
On Feb. 25, the House voted 75-70 to formally reprimand Libby, preventing her from speaking or voting until she apologizes for the post, which she has so far declined to do.
The post, which included the name, photograph and other details about a transgender student athlete, drew national attention. Days later, President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding to Maine over the state’s transgender policy, arguing it is in violation of federal anti-discrimination protections. Since then, the state has been subject to several funding cuts and probes, culminating in a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Libby is arguing that the censure is a violation of her First Amendment right. Additionally, Libby’s lawsuit against Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) and House Clerk Robert Hunt asserts that their sanction is a violation of her constituents’ right to free speech and that it disenfranchises the voters by depriving them of legislative representation.
On Friday, Justice Melissa DuBois of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine denied Libby’s request for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the censure, arguing that legislative immunity — which largely protects lawmakers from being sued for strictly legislative acts — shields Fecteau and Hunt from the claims in the case.
While acknowledging that the ability to suspend an elected representative’s privileges to speak or vote on the House floor “is a weighty sword to wield,” DuBois determined Fecteau’s actions “ultimately reflected the will of the majority of the House members” and that the sanction “is not of such extraordinary character as to obliterate the formidable shield the courts have provided to legislative acts.”
There have only been four censures in the Maine Legislature since 1820 and three of them — including the ongoing censure of Libby — have come in the past year and a half under Democratic majorities. The first censure was an independent from Auburn in 2001.
Libby appealed that ruling to the 1st Circuit Court, which on Monday denied her motion for an expedited ruling, according to Maine Public.
Seeking immediate intervention, Libby filed an emergency request with the U.S. Supreme Court and said while the broader case continues through the appeals process, she is “hopeful the court will act swiftly” to end the censure.

Free.,Trump border czar defends removal of U.S. citizen children,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-border-czar-defends-removal-us-citizen-children,,"WASHINGTON — White House border czar Tom Homan on Monday blamed the parents of U.S. citizen children the Trump administration sent to Honduras over the weekend.At a Monday morning press conference, Homan defended the government’s actions to remove three young children from two different families alongside their mothers who were in the country without legal authorization but participated in a program that allows otherwise law-abiding migrants to stay in their communities.“If you enter this country illegally, it’s a crime,” Homan said. “Knowing you’re in this country illegally, you put yourself in that position. You put your family in that position.”The children, all under the age of 10, were placed on deportation flights to Honduras on Friday after their mothers checked in with a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in New Orleans as part of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, which allows immigrants to stay in their communities while undergoing immigration court proceedings.An attorney for one of the children, Gracie Willis at the National Immigration Project, said the 4-year-old U.S. citizen with Stage 4 cancer was deported without access to his medication.Homan has argued the mothers requested to be deported with their children, but attorneys for the families argue they were “denied access to legal counsel, and swiftly deported without due process.”Due process concernsU.S. District Judge Terry Doughty, whom Trump appointed to a seat on the Louisiana federal bench in 2018, expressed concern that a 2-year-old U.S. citizen had been deported, despite her father’s wishes she remain in the U.S., according to court filings.Doughty scheduled a May 16 hearing because of his “strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.”“The government contends that this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her,” Doughty wrote in his order. “But the court doesn’t know that.”Willis, from the National Immigration Project, raised concerns about a lack of due process and how the deportations have separated families.“What we saw from ICE over the last several days is horrifying and baffling,” she said in a statement. “These mothers had no opportunity to speak with their co-parents to make the kinds of choices that parents are entitled to make for their children, the kinds of decisions that millions of parents make every day: ‘what is best for our child?’”Homan has argued the children were deported at the request of the mothers and that the Trump administration was “keeping families together.”“What we did is remove children with their mothers who requested their children depart with them,” he said. “When a parent says, ‘I want my 2-year-old baby to go with me,’ we made that happen. They weren't deported. We don't deport U.S. citizens. The parents made that decision, not the United States government.”Wisconsin judgeMonday’s remarks from Homan come the day before President Donald Trump will mark the 100th day of his second term. His early days in office have centered on carrying out his campaign promise of mass deportations of millions of people in the U.S. without permanent legal status.Trump will sign two executive orders on immigration late Monday: one relating to border security and another to require the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to publicly list so-called sanctuary cities that do not coordinate with federal immigration law enforcement.Homan also stood by the Trump administration’s decision to arrest a federal judge in Wisconsin on the grounds she obstructed immigration officials from detaining a man attending his court hearing. It marked an escalation between the Trump administration and the judiciary branch, raising concerns from Democrats.The arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan was highly publicized after she was handcuffed in public and FBI Director Kash Patel bragged about the arrest on social media.Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Fox News that the Trump administration was going to continue to go after judges who “think they’re above the law.”“When you cross that line to impediment or knowingly harboring, concealing an illegal alien from ICE, you will be prosecuted, judge or not,” Homan said.",,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

Sara Attleson is the new chair of the Democratic Party of New Mexico, according to voting results announced on Sunday.
Attleson, of Albuquerque, chairs the party’s Labor Caucus, as well as the Albuquerque Teachers Federation’s Committee on Political Education. She defeated Marisol Enriquez, Letitia Montoya and Joseph Weathers to lead the party. Former Chair Jessica Velasquez did not seek reelection.
Attleson said in a statement she wants to work with county-level Democratic parties “to make sure we have a presence in every community.”
“Democrats across the country have our work cut out for us,” she said in a statement. “But here in New Mexico, we have the energy to make sure that MAGA Republicans and Donald Trump are never able to get a foothold here.”
DPNM announced the results at the spring meeting of its governing body, the State Central Committee, at the Albuquerque Little Theater following voting by 466 SCC members via online absentee ballot from April 19-26. The new party officers’ terms end in 2027.
Party members elected Cameron Crawford as vice chair. Crawford, of Santa Fe, defeated incumbent Manny Crespin and Augustine Montoya to win the seat.
“In an era of unprecedented political turmoil, I will go to counties red and blue to rebuild community by showing up for everyone, regardless of who they vote for,” Crawford said in a statement. “Politics is about making people’s lives better, and I’m more than prepared to take that message far and wide.”
The party elected Brenda Hoskie as its treasurer. Hoskie, from Springstead, is an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation and chair of the McKinley County Democrats. She defeated Daniel Alfredo Garcia and Barbara Jordan to become secretary.
Members elected Julie Rochman as Secretary. Rochman, of Albuquerque, defeated Joseph Ortiz to become treasurer.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Fire Administration)The state of South Dakota will spend up to $250,000 to clear PFAS chemicals from local areas in the coming year.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS or “forever chemicals,” break down at an exceedingly slow rate in the natural environment. They’re found in products like nonstick cookware, water-resistant items like umbrellas or rain jackets, and cleaning products, among other items. 
Concerns about their prevalence in the environment and their impacts on human health have grown steadily in recent years, as they’ve been discovered in drinking water, fish and food packaging.
SD House defeats bill requiring ‘forever chemical’ labels on firefighting gear

PFAS are also found in a kind of firefighting foam that’s fallen out of favor, but fire departments around the U.S., including in South Dakota, still have some and need to dispose of it.
The South Dakota Board of Water and Natural Resources awarded a $250,000 Solid Waste Management grant to the state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR) last month to help communities collect and dispose of some PFAS sources. The citizen-led water resources board evaluates projects and signs off on funding through the solid waste program.
The grant will allow fire departments with PFAS foam, or schools whose science labs may still have chemicals, to summon the department’s contractor to collect and safely dispose of them at an out-of-state location. The state will also reach out directly to agencies, and has begun to contact fire departments, airports, and other public entities by phone to find out if they have PFAS for disposal.
The money comes from the Inspection, Compliance, and Remediation program, funded by a mix of fuel tank inspection fees and the sale of lottery tickets. Typically, cleanup grants through the program cover 80% of cleanup costs, with the entity requesting cleanup expected to cover the rest.
The South Dakota Legislature approved Senate Bill 33 this year to let DANR put $250,000 of program funds toward PFAS cleanups with no local match.
Andy Bruels with the DANR told the water resources board in March that a previous PFAS cleanup a few years ago cleaned up “a fair amount of material.” The contractor hauled it out of state for disposal, as typical landfills can’t adequately prevent the chemicals from continued seepage into the environment.
The legislation also allowed for the grants to be used in waste tire cleanup, but Bruels said the primary focus will be PFAS and that it’s unlikely much will be left for that secondary purpose.

(Photo courtesy of FEMA)Attorney General James Uthmeier settled a suit Monday accusing the former Federal Emergency Management Agency head and a FEMA supervisor of discrimination against supporters of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump during disaster relief efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton.
The suit came in November, after the supervisor advised relief workers in Florida to avoid houses displaying yard signs favoring Trump in Lake Placid, in Highlands County. Uthmeier agreed to drop the suit in exchange for an apologetic letter on behalf of the federal government, according to the notice of dismissal filed Monday.
“The United States and Ms. Criswell regret the actions giving rise to this case and agree with the State of Florida that those actions never should have occurred,” the letter states. “We are also hopeful that, in light of all we have provided, the State of Florida and its people can be confident that FEMA is striving to avoid a repeat of the events giving rise to this case and that the agency is committed to the fair, compassionate, and even-handed delivery of services.”
The letter from the U.S. Department of Justice also states that FEMA commits to providing political-discrimination training for employees.
Deanne Criswell, the former FEMA head, didn’t admit wrongdoing, and the letter directs responsibility to Marn’i Washington, the supervisor. As part of the settlement, Criswell and the state agreed to pay their own attorney fees, and Uthmeier also dropped the claims against Washington.
Former Attorney General Ashley Moody, whom Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed to the U.S. Senate, originally sought nominal and punitive damages from Criswell and Washington.
Criswell announced on Nov. 9 that the agency had fired Washington and called her behavior a clear violation of FEMA’s core values and principles. Moody’s complaint cited multiple interviews in which Washington said the message she sent to the relief workers, which the Daily Wire published, lacked context and that her supervisors knew about and encouraged her decision to avoid the homes of Trump supporters.
In a letter to the federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Washington wrote that she had received numerous death threats and that she didn’t have knowledge of the suit for months.
“The effort for scapegoating at my expense has methodically been implemented to the point that all of my inquiries and fair treatment throughout this process has been negated and intentionally delayed,” Washington wrote to U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks.
Uthmeier’s office did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.

(Photo provided by the Indiana Department of Correction)Clemency hearings for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie will take place in the coming weeks as the condemned man’s legal team fights to delay — or stop altogether — a pending May 20 execution.
Ritchie’s clemency petition, signed by the inmate on April 22, argued that he was “born with a severely damaged brain due to prenatal alcohol exposure.”

“His mother drank nearly every day during her pregnancy with Ben. She also smoked marijuana daily and took other drugs,” according to the filing. Lawyers additionally noted that a geneticist diagnosed Ritchie with Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS), “meaning his brain damage limits Ben’s functioning to that similar to a person with intellectual disability.”
Ritchie’s team further pointed a recent ruling handed down by the Indiana Supreme Court in which justices “unanimously agreed that Ben has brain damage caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol and other toxins.” But the court was split, 2-2, on whether Ritchie should be allowed to present evidence “of the effect of that damage on his behavior” on the night of his crime.
With clemency, the governor — in tandem with Indiana’s Parole Board — can elect to commute a death sentence to life imprisonment or grant a pardon for a criminal offense.
The parole board announced two upcoming clemency hearings for Ritchie to consider his petition: one on May 5 at the Indiana State Prison, located in Michigan City; and another on May 12 at the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis.
Both meetings are open to the public. The parole board will conduct a 10 a.m. interview with Ritchie at the state prison hearing. During the latter meeting, the board will hear testimony in favor of clemency from 9 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., and testimony opposed to clemency from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
The developments follow a ruling issued earlier this month by Indiana Supreme Court justices to set a May 20 execution date for Ritchie, who was convicted in 2002 for killing a law enforcement officer from Beech Grove.
What to expect
The Indiana Constitution gives the governor exclusive authority to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons for all offenses — including capital crimes — except for treason and impeachment. The parole board is tasked by state law with assisting in that process.
The five-member board, specifically, is responsible for conducting an investigation into the merits of a clemency petition. 
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Shortly after an execution date is set, the board sets a schedule for the filing of clemency petition; submission of supporting materials; an interview and psychiatric examination of the death row inmate; a public hearing; and a public announcement of the parole board’s recommendation.
Story continues below.

Members of the press and the general public are permitted to attend the inmate’s interview. 
The subsequent public hearing typically takes place two or three days prior to the execution date and is held in the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis.
Each side — the state and counsel for the death row inmate — is given 90 minutes to present their case for or against clemency. The parole board presides over the hearing, and frequently interjects with questions.
Once complete, board members individually submit their recommendations to the governor, who has final say over the matter.
Defense team seeks a stay
In a separate legal filing last week, Ritchie’s defense team petitioned the state supreme court for a new hearing to reconsider the inmate’s request for post-conviction relief.
They’re also seeking a stay to pause the execution altogether “to permit the full and fair consideration of the issues presented” in the rehearing request. Ritchie’s latest petition, attorneys emphasized, “has asserted unusually complex questions of fact and law that would be aided by oral argument or further briefing on the issues if the Court allows.”
The high court denied Ritchie any post-conviction relief in a decision issued April 15, following a series of exhausted appeals previously filed by the inmate and his legal team.



In 2004, former Indiana Gov. Joe Kernan commuted the death sentence of Darnell Williams to life imprisonment without parole on the basis that his co-defendant initially received a life sentence, making it “unjust” to execute only Williams.
Kernan, a Democrat, commuted another death sentence in 2005 of Michael Daniels, emphasizing doubts about Daniels’ personal responsibility for the crime and the quality of legal process leading to his death sentence.
The most recent was in 2009, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels commuted the death sentence for Arthur Baird, who killed his pregnant wife and her parents in 1985. Although the parole board denied his petition for clemency, Mitch Daniels granted Baird clemency one day before the scheduled execution, in part citing questions about Baird’s sanity.
The former Republican governor additionally noted that life without parole in murder cases was not an option at the time of Baird’s sentencing; it became an option in 1994.



Included in the post-conviction filings were claims that his trial and post-conviction counsel “provided ineffective assistance” by not investigating Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and by failing to “analyze the effect of Ritchie’s childhood exposure to excessive amounts of lead.”
Additionally, counsel emphasized that Ritchie was only 20 years old at the time of the crime, and “recent developments in the law” require the state supreme court to consider his age at sentencing. Ritchie’s team held, too, that the state “engaged in prosecutorial misconduct” throughout his jury trial.
Chief Justice Loretta Rush, who disagreed with the decision to deny further post-conviction relief proceedings, said in her opinion that she believed evidence submitted to the court suggested “a strong likelihood” that Ritchie suffered from FASD when he murdered William Toney, the police officer, in 2000.
Indiana Supreme Court sets May 20 execution date for death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie

Rush noted that Ritchie had recently been evaluated by two FASD experts, and she preferred to hold off on an execution date so the court has more time to “receive and consider” the experts’ evaluations.
But Justices Derek Molter and Geoffrey Slaughter said in their opinion that “what Ritchie’s experts turned up is irrelevant.” The issue before the court “is not whether Ritchie suffered from FASD in 2000 or whether he does so today,” they said. Rather, the justices must decide whether Ritchie’s trial lawyers “were constitutionally ineffective during sentencing for failing to investigate the possibility that Ritchie suffered from FASD then.”
The affirming justices maintained that Ritchie was unable to show a “reasonable possibility” of relief. 
Per court documents, the underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney, the Beech Grove police officer, later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at Toney, who did not survive the shooting.
The court set a Monday afternoon deadline for Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office to respond to the defense counsel’s motions.
The Republican attorney general requested an execution date for Ritchie last fall.
Executions were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until convicted killer Joseph Corcoran was put to death in December. The state paid $900,000 on execution drugs but won’t say how much was purchased. 
Ritchie and six other men remain on the state’s death row at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.

“As it relates to cannabis markets, Missouri is pretty famously the model to follow,” said Mackenzie Slade, CEO and owner of New York-based Cannabis Public Policy Consulting. “So I’m very interested in doing a super deep dive.”
In March, the state issued a request for proposals looking for a vendor to conduct a cannabis market and economic impact study. Currently, Missouri has issued nearly 400 cannabis licenses to operate full-scale cultivation and manufacturing facilities and dispensaries. The state will also eventually have 144 microbusiness licenses, which are limited in size and scope and meant to benefit disadvantaged business owners.

In 2024, Missouri sold$1.46 billion in total marijuana sales in the state’s second year of adult-use marijuana, outperforming states with a longer history of marijuana legalization like Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.
The results of the study will help the state determine “whether or when the state will be required to issue additional cannabis facility licenses and, if so, how many, where, and of what type,” according to a March press release from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
Missouri received three responses that fit the requirements of having at least five years of experience specializing in the economic impact of marijuana, or at least 10 years of experience conducting economic impact studies in general.
The responding agencies were Slade’s firm, St. Louis-based Capital Consulting Services and Oregon-based Whitney Economics. The firm that wins the bid will be awarded the $X million contract. 
Beau Whitney’s company, which conducts studies globally, gathers data monthly on the cannabis industry for each legal state on business licenses, supply capacity and revenues. 
“I have data that goes back multiple years,” he said, “and so I can say, ‘Here’s the progression of the state and its program,’” along with providing future projections 10 years out. 
Whitney calls Missouri a “success story.” In one of his recent reports that looked at investment potential nationwide, he found there’s still opportunities for growth, development and investment into the Missouri market. 
“And that’s unusual,” he said. “In Oregon where I’m based out of, I just gave an update to the Office of Economic Analysis and I basically said, there’s no investment opportunity in Oregon for any new businesses. Zero for the next 10 years.”
That’s because there’s too much supply, an over saturation of licenses and prices are so low that people can’t make any profit, he said. 
“My goal with Missouri is to give them the data that they need to avoid that scenario,” Whitney said.
Slade has seen the same in New York, where her firm has been based for about seven years. 
Her company administers a national survey on cannabis use, which essentially measures and quantifies demand behavior for consumers. One of the things that they use it for, she said, at a national level is to try to understand how states are performing based on their policies. 
“And Missouri continuously outperforms other states, relative to their date of sale,” she said. “…because they were able to stand up a market so quickly.”
Secrecy around ownership records raises questions about Missouri marijuana networks

That was in part because Missouri limited the number of licenses to get operational within just a few months. For the study, Slade proposed to use the state’s track and trace data to identify the efficiencies of the licenses. 
“That’s a prime example of where we would uncover some extremely important considerations for policy,” she said. “And I do believe that the intent of the study is to identify areas of policy that need to be updated.”
Tracey Jeffries’ company, Capital Consulting Services, has helped governments with economic feasibility studies for 15 years on a state and federal level, and she’s a certified Missouri minority-owned business enterprise as a Black woman owner. According to state policy, winners of any state contract must employ 10% minority-owned and 5% women-owned businesses. 
The advantage Jeffries believes she brings to the program is knowing her state and its economy, having led projects throughout Missouri. 
“DHSS has done a great job,” she said, “but it’s timely to have the feasibility study because this will benefit the regulators, the businesses, and most importantly to me, in my opinion, the community.”
State law says the cannabis regulators may “lift or ease any limit on the number of [cannabis] licensees or certificate holders in order to meet the demand for marijuana in the state and to ensure a competitive market while also preventing an over-concentration of marijuana facilities within the boundaries of any particular local government.” 
Experts generally agree that Missouri’s decision to only issue the minimum licenses allowed under its constitution has been the key to the industry’s boom. However, critics have long argued that the decision created a monopoly that’s kept out opportunities for people who were most impacted by the War on Drugs. While the microbusiness license program was included in the 2022 consutitional amendment to address inequities, the limitations on what these businesses can do make it difficult to turn a profit. 
If the department does issue additional licenses, at least half of those licenses must be awarded to owners of cannabis microbusiness facilities that have been operational for at least a year.
The study will also provide information regarding the overall economic stability of the regulated market, including strengths and risks, with a special emphasis on the market’s impact on economically distressed areas of the state. 
Jeremy Washington, spokesman for the Office of Administration, the agency that handles contracting for the state, said there isn’t a “published schedule for the completion of the evaluation process.” 
However, upon completion of the evaluation process, the MissouriBUYS Bid Board will be updated to reflect the changed status.  In addition, the entire procurement file will be published on the Division of Purchasing’s awarded bid and contract document site.

More than 3 million people with Medicare could be eligible for the difficult-to-find and expensive weight-loss drug under new guidance which can cover the medication for patients who are obese or those who have a history of heart disease and are at risk of a heart attack or stroke.  (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.




I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
States consider high costs, possible savings of covering weight-loss drugs for their workers

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Sean Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell, convinced the 2025 Legislature to reduce by two-thirds the amount of state income tax credits available to incentivize construction or rehabilitation of low-income housing statewide. Since 2022, Kansas has used the tax credit to make faster progress on addressing the state's housing shortage and advocates of the credit opposed the cutback touted by Tarwater. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Assistant city manager Braxton Copley pleaded with Kansas House members to reject a proposal to end the state’s participation in a tax incentive program shown to be successful in promoting construction or rehabilitation of low-income housing.
Copley, representing the city of Topeka, stood at a microphone in February at the Capitol to address Rep. Sean Tarwater, chairman of the House commerce committee and the sole public proponent of a bill eliminating Kansas’ low-income housing tax credit, or LIHTC, on July 1. Copley wasn’t alone in opposition to the bill. Nearly 40 organizations and individuals offered testimony denouncing details and timing of House Bill 2119.
“Simply put, government cannot afford to construct and manage a sufficient amount of housing to meet the needs,” Copley said. “Developers are unable and unwilling to construct low-income housing because the low rents will not allow them to achieve a market rate of return. The LIHTC program leverages tax credits to induce private developers to construct affordable housing by providing them a market rate of return.”
In exchange for state and federal tax credits, the affordability of the incentivized housing units was assured for terms of 15 years or 30 years with covenants placed on the real estate.
Copley said undercutting the state’s approach to LIHTC would exacerbate homelessness in communities throughout Kansas.
Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell, listened as a string of community activists, investors and bankers expanded on Copley’s thesis.
“I must say there are 39 opponents and I’m the only proponent, evidently,” Tarwater said. “This is not fair. You guys are going to need more people.”
Fast forward two months, and Tarwater pushed across the finish line on the final day of the 2025 legislative session the contents of House Bill 2289, which included a modified version of the much-maligned HB 2119. Instead of deleting LIHTC in July, the program would survive, on a shorter financial leash, until 2028.
“This is not exactly what we wanted when we set down this road,” Tarwater said. “We took a page out of Ronald Reagan’s book, and we’re going to take what we can get today and fight for the rest tomorrow.”
Tarwater objected to the ultimate cost of a program adding each year to tax credits that had to be honored by the state. Over a 10-year period, for example, the compounding effect of $25 million annual allocations of LIHTC tax credits could result in a state obligation of $250 million. The figure wouldn’t represent a direct expenditure by the state of Kansas, but would reflect the amount of future tax revenue foregone by the state as investors redeemed credits against their state tax liability.
Last week, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly signed the bundled bill rather than veto the measure and push the issue to the 2026 Legislature.
 
Financial haircut
The new Kansas law set a maximum on the amount of state housing tax credits issued this year at $25 million. In the final three years of LIHTC, only $8.8 million in annual credits would be available from the state for investors in affordable housing.
The law discontinued the state’s LIHTC match for investors receiving the 4% federal low-income housing credit, but retained the state match for developments qualifying for a 9% federal low-income housing credit.
Sen. Stephen Owens, R-Hesston, led negotiations on LIHTC legislation for the Senate. He viewed the final bill as a compromise that resulted in a diminished incentive, but provided a window of opportunity to convince lawmakers it should continue.
“This came to us from the House as a complete elimination of the low-income housing tax program,” he said. “Recognizing that there’s also some value to this program, the Senate’s position was to go back in and reduce it by about 70%.”
The program is managed by the Kansas Housing Resources Corporation, a self-supporting, nonprofit public corporation tasked with helping Kansans gain access to safe, affordable housing.
Emily Sharp, of the state Housing Resource Corporation, said substantial reduction in annual tax credit awards and deletion of the 4% program would diminish the state’s ability to fill wide gaps in housing. There will be a bigger scramble for the remaining credits, she said.
The 2028 sunset to the LIHTC should be concerning to communities struggling to meet housing demand, she said.
She said a 2021 state housing survey was conducted in collaboration with the governor’s Office of Rural Prosperity. The first Kansas assessment of its kind in 30 years showed an acute shortage. It was estimated the state needed to add at least 3,800 units annually, but was falling far below that level.
The National Low-Income Housing Coalition estimated Kansas had a deficit of 50,000 affordable housing units.
“We need more houses,” Sharp said. “Nationwide we’re seeing a shortage of housing. Kansas is no exception.”
 
Evolution of thought
In 2022, the Legislature and governor responded with passage of the affordable housing tax credit act that put in place a d0llar-for-dollar match by the state to the federal low-income housing credit.
The objective was to expand the volume of tax credits available to investors. The credits could be sold to generate revenue for construction of housing. The lower debt assumed by developers meant tenants could be offered below-market rental rates.
The state’s rate of housing development through state or federal investment tripled after implementation of the Kansas reform law three years ago. In 2021, state and federal government resources were associated with construction of 1,028 homes in Kansas. In contrast, 6,500 Kansas homes were funded in 2023 and 2024.
Ryan Vincent, executive director of the state Housing Resources Corporation, said the elimination of the state’s tax credit for housing — currently scheduled for 2028 — would mean that Kansas lagged further behind other states dangling lucrative incentives to attract housing investment.
“Eliminating the KAHTC would send a negative message to current and potential investors, signaling that housing development is a risky prospect in our state,” Vincent said. “Potential partners will avoid investing in an uncertain environment.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/P3051340-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-28 14:11:57.316531

A camping ban the city passed in September 2024 will be on the ballot for voters to decide during the next city election April 29. (Kristian Thacker for West Virginia Watch)Morgantown voters on Tuesday will decide the future of a law that would prohibit homeless people from camping on public property.
Early voting in the city’s election has been underway since April 16. 
Morgantown City Council passed the ordinance in September, joining dozens of cities around the country to prohibit public camping after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a similar camping ban in Grants Pass, Oregon, amid record levels of homelessness. 
Morgantown’s law, which has so far not gone into effect, would prohibit camping on any public property — including streets, parks and trails — and also prohibit storing personal property in public areas. Second and third violations of the law are punishable by fines of $200 and $300 and/or 30 days in jail, respectively. 
After the ordinance passed, Morgantown Coalition for Housing Action successfully petitioned to have it repealed or put it on the ballot during a city election. Council voted four to three for the latter in November. 
According to the city, the camping ban appears on the right side of the ballot under “Ballot issues.” Voting “yes” on “Article 1157 Prohibiting Camping on Public Property” would be a vote to repeal the ordinance. Voting “no” would be a vote in favor of keeping the ordinance in place. 
Voters will also decide their council members in wards two, four and six and a ballot issue to allow the city manager to live outside the city while in office.
Polls open at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday and close at 7:30 p.m.

Witnesses spotted the Otero Fire in the bosque east of Socorro and the Alamo Fire in a neighborhood in Grants on Sunday evening. The Grants Fire is fully contained at between 3 and 5 acres, said Forestry spokesperson George Ducker. Despite progress overnight in Socorro, where crews built a fire line across the northern edge of the 360-acre fire, the Otero Fire is 0% contained, Ducker said. 
The causes of both fires remains under investigation, Ducker said, though they occurred amid high winds and ongoing drought across the state. The National Interagency Fire Center earlier this month warned that most of the state would experience above-normal wildfire risk, and that the risk would spread to the western two-thirds of the state as May approaches. A new forecast is expected in the next few days. 
High winds around 7 p.m. pushed the Alamo Fire on the east side Grants into structures, burning eight structures and six outbuildings and prompting evacuations. Residents are being allowed to return this morning, Ducker said, and crews will focus on watching for hotspots and dealing with the burned structures, now that the fire is fully contained. 
In the Socorro-area fire, crews detected active wildfire burning on the south end of the perimeter. They plan today to hold and increase containment lines.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Hundreds of leaders at colleges and universities from across the United States recently signed  an open letter to the Trump Administration, rebuking “the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education.”
Only one New Mexico higher-education leader signed the letter — from a small college in Santa Fe.
In the first 100 days, the Trump administration has frozen billions of dollars in research grants and threatened further cuts if universities fail to comply with policies to reshape admissions, curriculum and speech on campus. Broadly, the Trump and Republicans have alleged higher education indoctrinates students with left-wing ideologies, and are using federal funds as leverage to require universities to change campus policies.
Last week, Harvard University sued the Trump administration over its freezing of $2.2 billion in grants after the school refused to comply with federal demands to limit activism on campus.
The letter from academics, released last week by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, pushes back against the Trump Administration, penning a defense of higher education.
“We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight,” the letter states. “However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses. We will always seek effective and fair financial practices, but we must reject the coercive use of public research funding.”
As of Monday morning, the letter had amassed 523 signatures from colleges, universities and scholarly societies.
Leaders from University of New Mexico and New Mexico State University, the state’s largest schools, did not sign on.When reached for comment, Cinnamon Blair, a spokesperson for UNM wrote: “What I can share is that UNM’s participation in any statements is an internal administrative decision, and will be reflected in the public record.”
New Mexico State University spokesperson Amanda Bradford confirmed the administration had not signed the letter, stating: “The university has no further comments on this topic at this time.”
As of press time, Thom Chesney, president of Southwestern College, a private graduate-level school tucked away on Santa Fe’s Southside, remains the only New Mexico school leader on the list.
Southwestern College offers a variety of graduate-level programs and certificates, including: master’s degrees in counseling, art therapy and consciousness in action; as well as a Ph.D in visionary practice and regenerative leadership.
In an interview with Source NM, Chesney said higher education is facing unprecedented threats at multiple levels. Chesney took the position at Southwestern College eight months ago, following three years as president at Clarke University in Iowa and nearly eight years as president of Brookhaven College in Texas, among other academic postings. He’s been in higher education for nearly 30 years and started his work in academia teaching English, American and British literature and the humanities.
“We’ve not seen this before,” Chesney said. “The federal government stepping in and making demands about how we admit, who we admit and what we teach — that flies directly in the face of independence, of building a curriculum.”
Chesney told Source NM that this was the right time for his college to speak out, and said other New Mexican institutions are trying to navigate a difficult position.
“I’m going to defend my colleagues, my peers from the public and private institutions in New Mexico, who haven’t signed the letter,” Chesney said. “They’re not on the sidelines, they’re not silent, in assent or giving in — we can’t assume any of that. They are absolutely, I believe, thinking through where their space is, at this time, for this type of response.”
Chesney said the letter he signed offers the chance to be part of “a collective, unified voice.”
“It fits in with not only the mission of my institution, but also the broader need to respond in a call to action for dialogue, for decorum to come together and recognize we have a shared space, to identify the successes, the flaws — all of that, rather than react reactionarily,” he said.
Chesney noted that all higher education institutions face threats, regardless of size and programs. Southwestern College’s enrollment is just over 320 students. While his institution does not receive federal research grants, some of the students rely on Title IV funds to attend college. The college also offers a counseling center at which its counseling and therapy students receive real-world experience and provide low-cost or no-cost services for 500 Santa Fe residents.
“If someone comes in and says ‘you can’t do that anymore,’ that’s a threat,” he said. “That threatens the wellness of Santa Fe’s Southside, Santa Fe in general and ultimately New Mexico, in my mind.”
Not only did Chesney sign the letter, he hopes his participation in a national dialogue creates an opportunity for students to become more engaged with faculty and administrators in addressing the future of higher education.
And he has a message for prospective students who are considering further training or schooling: “Don’t become cynical.”
“No one should give up on that dream or that aspiration to do the kind of learning that leads them into opportunities to serve and create and have jobs that are for the greater, common good,” Chesney said.

Laura Kelly, pictured here at a May 14, 2024, event in Topeka, signed 11 bills into law last week following the close of the 2025 legislative session. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly announced Friday she had signed into law 11 bills, meeting a deadline and cementing public education funding, tax incentives for major data centers and a new crime for possessing, creating or distributing AI-generated child pornography.
The bills were bipartisan, Kelly said, as she signed them before the end of the 10-day period she has to take action after the Legislature delivers them to her.
Crime and law enforcement
Senate Bill 186 crafted first-time, clear protections for those who are the subject of AI-generated imagery without their consent. It’s an effort to mitigate the harms caused by technology, “in both the digital realm and the physical world,” Kelly said in a news release.
“Given the rise of AI-enabled crime, enhancing public safety for our fellow Kansans is crucial,” Kelly said.
The law applies to the alteration of real photos or generating new material from scratch, said Rep. Brad Barrett, an Osage City Republican who sat on the House committee that heard and negotiated the original bill. 
“This legislation strengthens our child exploitation laws to protect kids from this evolving threat and also updates our breach of privacy law to shield adults from having their images maliciously altered to appear nude or sexually explicit when they have an expectation of privacy,” he said.
The law adds to the definition of sex crimes within the Kansas Criminal Code to include AI-generated material. It also modifies existing criminal bond-setting procedure to hike up bond rates for any defendant with prior convictions of sexually violent crimes. The minimum bond for those defendants is now $750,000, which Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes said addresses patterns of “predatory behavior.”
“This part of the bill ensures the safety of victims comes first,” Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said. “By requiring the consideration of similar prior acts when setting bond, we can alleviate some of the fear for victims.”
Senate Bill 156 increases the amount of money inmates can receive from the Kansas Department of Corrections for losses, personal injury or property damage.
Senate Bill 204 seals criminal and juvenile cases — meaning information is kept secret — until an arrest warrant is executed. It also creates a new appointment process for trustees of county law libraries.
Senate Bill 237 empowers law enforcement officers to investigate violations of the Scrap Metal Theft Reduction Act, which targets scrap metal dealers. It was initially proposed by the Wichita Police Department.
Industry and development
Kelly said a new law that incentivizes major data center projects in Kansas gives “the state another tool in the toolbox to bring jobs, infrastructure, and prosperity to Kansas communities through economic development.”
Senate Bill 98 creates a 20-year sales tax exemption for data centers investing at least $250 million within five years of opening. The exemption could include land acquisition, development and construction, equipment acquisition and permitting, design, engineering, labor for installing and maintaining data center equipment, and lease payments.
Businesses that receive the exemption must by law conserve, reuse, and replace water, pay for electricity from a public utility for 10 years and maintain at least 20 new jobs at the data center within two years of launching.
Kelly also signed into law House Bill 2289, which was championed by Stilwell Republican Rep. Sean Tarwater and enacts limits on housing tax credits. Over time, the law eventually will dismantle the state’s affordable housing tax credit program.
Taxes and government
House Bill 2125 reauthorized the 20-mill statewide school property tax levy to finance public schools through the 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 school years. The bill also sets strict deadlines on local taxing entities, enabling county clerks to use a taxing jurisdiction’s budget and tax levy from the previous year if it doesn’t submit budget information by Oct. 1.
House Bill 2231 shifts Kansas to a corporate income tax calculation method that aligns with the majority of states. Kelly said the law evens “the playing field for Kansas-based businesses, making the state more attractive for capital investment, and encouraging job creation.”
House Bill 2335 creates, beginning in January, a new license plate for members of hunting organization Hunter Nation.
House Bill 2007 cleans up statutes that were amended multiple times during the 2025 session.
House Bill 2275 enables a handful of Kansas counties to ask voters whether they favor a sales tax proposal to fund projects. It also creates a tax exemption for custom meat processing sales.
In Finney County, county commissioners want to impose a 0.5% sales tax to finance construction or remodeling projects in the county courthouse, jail, law enforcement center or other administrative building.
In Jackson County, commissioners want to ask voters if they would favor a 0.25% sales tax to support hospital services.
In Pawnee County, commissioners can ask voters if they want to pay an up to 1% sales tax for providing health care services and “furnish” and “equip” public safety operations.
In Seward County, voters will decide if they want to pay a 0.5% sales tax to fund road and bridge projects.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/P5140012-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax, a fixture in Northern Virginia politics for more than three decades, announced Monday he will not seek reelection after a resurgence of cancer, saying the sun is setting on his time in public service.
In a statement published on his social media accounts, Connolly thanked supporters for their “good wishes and compassion,” crediting their encouragement with giving him strength “in my fights — both against cancer and in our collective defense of democracy.” 
He revealed that although initial treatments had seemed successful, his cancer has returned. “I’ll do everything possible to continue to represent you and thank you for your grace,” he wrote.
Connolly, 75, said he will soon step down as ranking member of the House Oversight Committee and finish out the remainder of his term with “no rancor and a full heart.” He added, “With pride in what we’ve accomplished together over 30 years, my loving family and staff sustain me. My extended family — you all have been a joy to serve.”
The news struck a deeply emotional chord among colleagues and political leaders across Virginia and Washington, D.C.
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., reflected on Connolly’s announcement with admiration, saying, “No one has fought harder when it comes to Virginia’s federal workforce, transportation infrastructure, congressional oversight, and our commitment to critical alliances like NATO.” 
Kaine said he spoke with Connolly on Monday morning, telling him of his “profound admiration for his service and deep love for him and Smitty,” Connolly’s wife.
House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., Connolly’s counterpart on the committee, also expressed his support following the announcement.
“I’m saddened to hear that Ranking Member Connolly’s cancer has returned,” Comer said in a statement Monday. He praised Connolly as “a steadfast public servant who has spent his career serving Northern Virginians with honor and integrity.”
Comer added, “It’s an honor to serve the American people alongside him and I am rooting for him as he battles cancer once again. Our prayers are with Ranking Member Connolly and his family.”
Born in Boston, Connolly’s life reflected a unique mix of scholarship, global expertise, and local passion. He spent a decade with the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, managing oversight on international economics, narcotics policy and U.N. affairs, and publishing reports on U.S. policy in El Salvador, Central America, Israel and the Persian Gulf.
Later, Connolly moved into leadership roles in the private sector at SRI International and SAIC before fully turning to public service in Fairfax County. He was elected Providence District Supervisor in 1995, and in 2003, became chairman of the county’s Board of Supervisors, where he guided Fairfax’s rapid growth while promoting education, environmental stewardship and smart development.
Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, recalled first working with Connolly during those local government years. 
“The congressman was a visionary leader for Fairfax County who moved on to a national role defending federal workers and our democratic institutions,” Surovell said. “Northern Virginia is a better, stronger place because of Gerry Connolly’s tireless advocacy, and our democracy is healthier because of his unwavering dedication.”
Connolly carried that same blend of policy chops and political muscle to Washington after winning election to Congress in 2008. Representing Virginia’s 11th District — anchored in suburban Fairfax County — he quickly built a reputation for mastering the nuts and bolts of government reform.
He co-authored the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act with Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California, seeking to streamline how the government buys new technology and reduces waste. 
Connolly also worked to cut red tape through the Government Reports Elimination Act of 2014, which scrapped about 100 outdated or redundant federal reporting requirements. His commitment to oversight and efficiency earned him recognition as one of the most effective lawmakers in Congress by the Center for Effective Lawmaking.
“Throughout his career, Gerry Connolly has exemplified the very best of public service — fiercely intelligent, deeply principled, and relentlessly committed to the people of Northern Virginia and our nation,” U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Monday. Warner called Connolly “one of the toughest fighters I know” and said he was “keeping him in our hearts and prayers.”
Connolly’s record reflected a consistently progressive bent. He championed abortion rights, voting against the Stupak-Pitts Amendment and supporting federal funding for Planned Parenthood. He campaigned for LGBTQ rights long before marriage equality became the law of the land, backing efforts to repeal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and the Defense of Marriage Act.
He was also a strong advocate for environmental protections, helping to found the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, and supported investments in renewable energy technologies.
Connolly did not shy from political combat, especially during the Trump presidency. He voted to impeach Donald Trump and memorably blasted Republican proposals to rename Dulles Airport after Trump, quipping, “If Republicans want to name something after him, I suggest they find a federal prison.”
State Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, praised Connolly’s fighting spirit and intellect. 
“Congressman Connolly always brings unmatched intellect, wit, and passion to his work,” Bagby said. “Cancer stands no chance against his fighting Irish spirit.” Bagby credited Connolly with making the commonwealth stronger through decades of dedicated service.
In recent years, Connolly continued to dominate his electoral contests, defeating a primary challenger in 2024 with more than 86% of the vote and cruising to reelection against Republican Mike Van Meter. 
Even as health challenges loomed, he maintained an active role in legislative oversight and defending democratic institutions.
Connolly’s retirement marks the close of an era for Northern Virginia, where his leadership became synonymous with effective, passionate advocacy. His colleagues emphasized that his impact would long outlast his time in office.
Former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, also praised Connolly’s legacy and spirit, calling him a model public servant whose impact will be felt across Virginia for generations.
“For more than three decades, Congressman Connolly has stood up for Virginians — dedicating his career to public service and making our Commonwealth stronger,” Spanberger said Monday. “He has responded to the needs of his neighbors, strengthened the communities he represented, and worked to grow the Democratic Party in Fairfax and across Northern Virginia.”

The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.

“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.











I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Members of the North Carolina General Assembly took a post-Easter break last week as they prepared for what promises to be the busiest period of the 2025 session in May and June, but prior to that, Republican leaders in the state Senate unveiled and quickly approved their version of a new two-year state budget.
The proposal attracted sharp criticism from Democratic senators who blasted the tiny pay raises allotted to teachers and state employees, as well as the decision to double down on regressive corporate tax cuts at a time in which the state’s economists are warning of impending revenue shortfalls. And recently, NC Newsline caught up with one of those critics, State Senator Graig Meyer. He’s not only worried about the budget, he’s deeply concerned about what a host of other top state and national GOP priorities portend for our country’s future.

U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth endorsed Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton on Monday in the 2026 Democratic primary for Illinois’ open seat to replace longtime Sen. Dick Durbin.

Duckworth’s endorsement comes after Gov. JB Pritzker endorsed Stratton on Friday, one day after she entered the Senate contest. With no other Democratic candidates announcing campaigns for the 2026 primary by Monday morning, Stratton secured the endorsement of two of the state’s top Democrats before fielding any competition.

“Juliana has not only proven to be an experienced and effective Lieutenant Governor — she’s demonstrated time and again that she truly understands and cares for working people,” Duckworth said in a statement. “Their struggles are her struggles. Their wins are her wins.”

Duckworth, a Democrat from Hoffman Estates, will take over as the state’s senior senator in January 2027 after Durbin’s term ends, as he announced last week he plans to retire. An Army veteran who earned a Purple Heart while serving in Iraq, Duckworth was elected to the Senate in 2016.

“Her many years spent in public service, along with her experience as a mom to four daughters and a caregiver to her own mother, have given her the tenacity, grit and perspective to be a true advocate on behalf of working families,” Duckworth said of Stratton.

Durbin told reporters at his Springfield home last week that he will likely not make any endorsements in the primary.

Stratton secured Pritzker’s endorsement Friday. The two have spent the last six years leading Illinois following two successful elections.

Pritzker praised Stratton as a “champion for women’s rights, for job creation, for rural families, for farmers, for criminal justice, for early childhood education,” and credited the lieutenant governor as having played an integral role in his administration.

Asked Friday whether his endorsement tamps down a competitive race for Durbin’s seat, Pritzker said, “Anybody who wants to run should run. But I’m telling you this is the person whose best able to serve with integrity, with honor.”

Stratton, of Chicago, has quickly risen through the ranks of Illinois politics after first being elected as a state representative in 2016. She was elected lieutenant governor two years later as Pritzker’s running mate during the 2018 campaign.

It’s still unclear whether other Democrats will announce they are joining Stratton in the primary as whoever enters the race will go in knowing they won’t be endorsed by two of the state’s leading Democrats.

U.S. Reps. Lauren Underwood, of Naperville, Raja Krishnamoorthi, of Schaumburg, Robin Kelly, of Matteson, and state Treasurer Mike Frerichs, of Chicago, all have said they are considering entering the race.

Meet Jennifer and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
It feels like nowadays, you can’t talk about the professionalized world of fighting for entertainment without talking about Donald Trump.
Earlier this month, Trump and several Cabinet members sat cageside at the UFC match in Miami; Trump himself holds a spot in the WWE Hall of Fame, where his official bio page notes that he’s the first WWE Hall of Famer to hold the presidency. Ahead of last weekend’s annual WrestleMania, wrestling news sites were abuzz with rumors that the president might again be ringside. At the same time, one of professional wrestling’s biggest stars, Roman Reigns, made headlines for declaring himself as a Trump supporter. 
The former CEO of WWE, Vince McMahon, is a longtime friend of the president’s and financial supporter of his political endeavors; McMahon’s now-estranged wife, Linda, is also a former WWE CEO and a current member of Trump’s Cabinet. And the CEO of UFC, Dana White, introduced Trump before he spoke on the final night of last summer’s Republican National Convention — Hulk Hogan also spoke, ripping off his shirt to reveal Trump/Vance campaign merch — and attended Trump’s inauguration in January. 
The kinds of theatrics baked into the massive success of professional wrestling have been on display throughout Trump’s ascendency in American politics. On the campaign trail and now in the White House, a Trump event has a distinctive feel, a well-honed blend of spectacle, pageantry and hypermasculinity. It’s a style that feels lifted from the professional wrestling handbook, where aesthetics and narrative device choices are central to the delivery. In professional wrestling, this product is a form of entertainment that lets fans — predominantly young men — openly feel and freely celebrate masculinity. In the second Trump administration, the product is a barrage of new policy measures intent on crafting a very specific version of America where the feelings of men are prioritized and their power is irrefutable. 
Though not a part of the action in the ring, there’s another significant tie between professional fighting and the Trump administration: allegations of sexual misconduct that have stretched back for decades. Vince McMahon, the visionary showman who made professional wrestling into the cultural force it is today, built the persona of “Mr. McMahon” around being a womanizing, vindictive philanderer — and today faces real-life accusations of sex trafficking, which he has denied. Donald Trump, the visionary showman who reshaped American politics in the mold of reality television, built his industry-spanning brand in part around the idea of being the consummate ladies’ man — and won the presidency for the first time just weeks after the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked in which Trump boasted, “And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything….Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.”
Central to the concept of professional wrestling is the practice of kayfabe, or committing to the illusion that clearly staged events are real and true. It’s a narrative device that asks audiences to suspend their disbelief, not in a way of passive acceptance, but rather active participation in the creation of what is possible. 
“It really does matter how well you’re doing the performance, but then what also really matters is how much the audience is going to buy into it. If they’re emotionally connected, that’s where the buy-in comes in,” said CarrieLynn Reinhard, an associate professor of communication arts and sciences at Dominican University and an expert on narrative devices in professional wrestling. “When you look at what Trump does, he is very good at getting to people’s emotions and understanding their emotions and — I’m going to say — manipulating their emotions for his own goals, and in doing so, he focuses on a reality that he believes in or at least he performs to believe in.”
Reinhard pointed to Trump’s rollout of tariffs — which he touted as immediately bolstering the economy even as markets tumbled — as an example of this dynamic. “What’s interesting is that with that little bit of doubt, his followers, his fans, they have the ability to engage in that rationalization that allows them to say, ‘He’s got a plan.’” 
The gimmicks
Professional wrestling is immensely popular in America, one of the most enduring and dominant forms of pop culture of the past three decades. Just last year, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) merged with the WWE under one new parent company, TKO. UFC is now the fourth-most watched sports league in America, after MLB, the NFL and the NBA. 
And the people who made UFC and WWE what they are today are also inextricably intertwined with the creation and actions of the dual Trump presidencies. 
By the time Trump mounted his first campaign during the 2016 presidential race, the McMahons were already major Republican donors. Linda, the former CEO of WWE and the current secretary of education, contributed a total of $7.2 million to two pro-Trump super PACs that cycle — Rebuilding America Now and Future45 — and the couple together donated more than $10 million to outside groups funding Trump’s race for the presidency. The McMahons also supported Trump before he formally entered politics, donating $5 million to the Trump Foundation in 2007.
Linda McMahon’s ability and facility in playing a role — a skill honed during her time as not only a WWE executive but also an on-screen performer — is essential to understanding her nomination within this administration, according to Kelly Dittmar, an associate professor of political science and the director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. 
In naming her to his Cabinet, Trump “chose somebody who was willing to work herself out of a job. He had to find somebody that was willing to go and sit at a confirmation hearing and try to explain how she wanted to be the secretary of education, but also effectively get rid of the Department of Education, which is an incredibly hard position to be put in,” Dittmar said.
It feels not dissimilar to a part she had in what is considered by many fans to be one of the most infamous WWE storylines, playing comatose in a wheelchair for weeks before ultimately rising from her supposed catatonic state inside the ring to kick her philandering husband in the groin on live TV. 
This time, of course, the shock ending isn’t revenge for a titillating affair, but effectively shuttering a major federal agency. 
Dana White, the CEO of UFC, has also been a longtime fixture in Trumpworld. He spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, 2020 and 2024. When it was clear Trump had won a second term last November, White spoke at the victory celebration, saying, “I’m in the tough guy business, and this man is the toughest, most resilient human being that I’ve ever met in my life.” White has long credited Trump for supporting UFC from its start, hosting UFC matches at Trump properties, attending events cageside, and generally being a champion of the brand of macho entertainment that became explosively popular under White’s watch. 
The accusations
The Trump administration and WWE share another overlapping characteristic: The way leaders of both have faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct and sexual abuse, or of ignoring such misconduct. 
Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women and long surrounded himself with men who have been similarly accused during his time in the public eye, was found liable by a jury in 2023 of sexually abusing and defaming the advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. In his second term, he put forth multiple nominees accused of or linked to sexual misconduct allegations.    
White has offered more tacit support in other ways that underscore the misogyny and allegations of criminal sexual misconduct that proliferate in Trumpworld. In March, White welcomed Andrew and Tristan Tate ringside. The brothers — who face charges in Romania, including rape, human trafficking, trafficking of minors and sex with a minor — returned to the United States in February. They have denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges against them “garbage” and part of a “conspiracy.”  The Financial Times reported that the Trump administration asked Romanian officials to return the Tates’ passports to them and allow them to travel while the criminal case against them proceeded in court. Trump’s presidential envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, raised the Tates’ case with the Romanian foreign minister. Additionally, Paul Ingrassia, a former Tate attorney, is now a White House liaison for the Department of Justice. 
The McMahons are currently facing a lawsuit accusing them of failing to stop abuse by an employee from the 1970s to the early 1990s. The suit, from “ring boys” who helped with setting up and breaking down wrestling matches, was filed in October. It says that a former WWE employee, Mel Phillips, sexually assaulted the ring boys and that the McMahons fired him in 1988 because of abuse allegations and then rehired him six weeks later. In a February statement, Greg Gutzler, the attorney representing the ring boys, said, “My clients’ lives were destroyed by the defendants who allowed and enabled the open, rampant sexual abuse to occur for years. … We will bring light to their truth and fight for accountability and justice.”
In early April, attorneys for Linda McMahon filed a motion to dismiss the ring boys’ lawsuit, saying that she has no connection to the state of Maryland, where it was filed. She also asserts that she has never met or communicated with the plaintiffs, to the best of her knowledge and memory. Vince McMahon has also denied all wrongdoing. Attorneys for Vince McMahon, Linda McMahon and WWE did not respond to The 19th’s request for comment.  
Linda McMahon’s time in the WWE, including the ring boys’ suit, was barely a topic in her February confirmation hearing. 
Tom Cole was the first of the ring boys to come forward with allegations about sexual abuse while employed by WWE, according to his brother, Lee Cole. Tom Cole died by suicide in 2021. 
Lee Cole said that he thinks people have failed to take the allegations against the McMahons seriously because of their ties to wrestling. “This has always been a wrestling story, and people have always known wrestling has been faked. And so they look down at these things, not knowing whether it’s a job — whether they’re pulling a job — or whether it’s real. They don’t know. People don’t take wrestling seriously,” Cole said. 
Cole said he understands that there has been an increase in attention around the McMahons and the ring boys’ lawsuit as a result of Linda McMahon’s role within the Trump administration. Too often, he said, he has seen reporters miss the mark by focusing their stories on the McMahons through the lens of Trump. 
But to understand Trump, you need to understand the McMahons, the way they have used power, fame, and the ability to craft narratives that keep fans invested in the WWE brand and willing to dismiss the naysayers. 
As a Trump supporter, Cole said he can see the appeal McMahon holds for the administration. 
“They’re entertainers. Linda McMahon is an entertainer. She was part of the entertainment world. Why else would Donald Trump love her so much? He’s an entertainer.”
The ring boys’ suit isn’t the only accusation of misconduct against the McMahons. In 2024, Vince McMahon was sued by former employee Janel Grant; in her suit, Grant accuses McMahon of sex trafficking, making her employment contingent on engaging in a sexual relationship with him and being sexually available to others within WWE. WWE and former WWE executive, John Laurinaitis, are named as defendants in the suit as well. All defendants in Grant’s lawsuit have denied all wrongdoing. Attorneys for Vince McMahon and WWE did not respond to The 19th’s request for comment.
When it comes to the allegations of sexual assault against both Trump and McMahon, Reinhard said she sees “the double whammy of the toxic masculinity that still accepts and promotes — something we are seeing more of now since Trump won — the idea that women are supposed to be controlled and then the idea that if you’ve got the money and you’ve got the time, you’re able to essentially spend your way out of these allegations, spend your way out of any charges and essentially wait out the public debate until people forget about it.” 
The feelings
Both Trump and professional wrestling are massive cultural entities that allow men to express their emotions, especially about their own masculinity. In the ring and now in the White House, men’s feelings matter — especially when it comes to defending their own identities and the men who give them that space to publicly feel and perform. “The idea of emotions being antithetical to politics really needs to be addressed, because they’re not just emotions — they’re a motivating force,” Reinhard said.
In the administration, the feelings lead to policies that promote a world where men can not only feel freely, but control the levers of society to make space for these feelings, too. 
Letting voters get caught up in the fandom makes the unprecedented policy decisions all the more possible. From tariffs that threaten to raise daily costs on voters who say they voted because of the economy, to DOGE cuts resulting in job and program losses that are upending economic security for many, to a proclamation for National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month from a sitting president found liable for sexual abuse in 2023, the second Trump administration has taken to operating in a way that constantly asks constituents to not just accept but actively buy in to a reality that runs counter to the facts on the ground. It’s kayfabe for government: Creating a world for men to freely express emotion and set policies with no limits — and no consequences — for violating once accepted standards and norms.
The second Trump administration is showcasing a “much more extreme” version of the first Trump term’s commitment to “dismantling a particular version of politics on the Hill,” said Sarah Banet-Weiser, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania whose research focuses on gender, media and politics. “And if you dismantle those politics, you know, you have to replace them with something,” Banet-Weiser said. 
And what remains is a stoking of men’s feelings in the wake of a slew of public policy decisions that in turn provoke even more emotion — even when the feelings run counter to the facts. The difference between reality television as entertainment and reality television as a political system is the consequences, Banet-Weiser said. “It’s not a group of housewives who fight and are riddled with scandal and then go on with their lives. It’s about the livelihoods of the American people.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Welcome to The Topline, a weekly roundup of the big numbers driving the Minnesota news cycle, as well as the smaller ones that you might have missed. This week: green cities; a stunning decline in Black homeownership; America’s most polluted air; an unusually long stretch without homicides; and Minnesota’s most conservative county. 
The greenest cities (literally)
The Washington Post has used data from the Arbor Day Foundation and the U.S. Forest Service to map tree cover across the country’s urban areas. Tree cover is primarily a function of the local climate — they grow readily in areas that were naturally forested before the arrival of Europeans, and less so in places like deserts.
More than half of Atlanta is covered by trees, for instance. Less than 9% of Phoenix is.
But policy plays a role too, and some cities are taking steps to plant more of them for a variety of reasons, including their cooling effect on the urban environment. 
Here in Minnesota, where the eastern forests meet the central prairie, you can see the gradient in canopy cover as you drive west. Duluth, for instance, is about 40% trees. Minneapolis-St. Paul is closer to 30%. Less than 15% of Fargo-Moohead has tree cover.
Black homeownership nosedives
A recent report by the Minnesota State Demographic Center shows that the overall rate of homeownership since 1970 has held steady at roughly 72%. But there has been a precipitous decline in Black homeownership over the same period.
In 1970, for instance, 42% of Black families were homeowners. In 2022 just 26% were. 
“In other words, since the 1970s, Black or African American householders have been increasingly concentrated into rental housing units,” according to the analysis. “This is a historical trend unique to Black or African American households.” The decline has been consistent across every decade except the 1990s. 
Another interesting wrinkle: The decline happening almost exclusively among U.S.-born Black families. Among Black immigrants, homeownership rates increased. 
The numbers suggest that Minnesota’s well-known racial disparities, among the worst in the nation, owe more to Black families falling behind than to white ones getting ahead. The fact that Minnesota-born Black families seem to be doing worse than their new immigrant counterparts is especially damning, and a sign that policymakers’ efforts to address the state’s disparities are failing.
America’s most air-polluted places
They’re mostly in California, according to the American Lung Association’s latest State of the Air report. But a couple Midwestern cities also make the list, including Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis and Cleveland.
The study finds, overall, that nearly half of the U.S. breathes in unhealthy levels of air pollution. 
“Air pollution is causing kids to have asthma attacks, making people who work outdoors sick, and leading to low birth weight in babies,” said Harold Wimmer, CEO of the American Lung Association. “This year’s report shows the dramatic impact that air pollution has on a growing number of people.”
The findings are especially concerning this year as the Trump administration is taking steps to both weaken federal regulations on air pollutants and to stop collecting much of the data that scientists use to track air pollution around the world.
Minneapolis posts longest stretch without a homicide in more than eight years
The 62 days between February 15 and April 18 mark the longest homicide-free stretch in Minneapolis since at least 2017, the Star Tribune reports. It’s a nice little milestone but bear in mind that homicides are currently falling virtually everywhere in the country, making it difficult to ascribe Minneapolis’ recent dry spell to any particular policy or policing decision.
So far this year, Minneapolis homicides are down by more than 50% from where they were last year at this time. That’s an impressive number, but it remains to be seen whether it’s the start of a durable trend or just the reflection of the regular ebb and flow of violent crime.
Minnesota’s most conservative county
It’s Morrison County in north-central Minnesota, population 34,000, per the Star Tribune. More than 70% of the county’s voters picked Donald Trump in the last three elections, and the overwhelming majority of them remain pleased with their pick despite the economic chaos he’s already caused.
Morrison is virtually all white and in the bottom fifth of the state for household income. Several of the voters who spoke with the Star Tribune appear to be deeply misinformed on basic facts about American society. 
One government employee, who believes antifa was behind Jan. 6 and who is indefinitely postponing building a new home because of Trump’s policies, told the paper he remains 100% devoted to the billionaire convicted felon in the White House: “He’s me, just at a lot bigger level.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1468619438.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The North Carolina Supreme Court seemed to side with the agriculture lobby last Wednesday in a hearing for a case whose outcome could nullify key environmental, civil rights and public health protections for neighbors of the state’s 2,000 industrialized livestock farms.
If the justices uphold an appellate court’s decision in favor of the N.C. Farm Bureau Federation, the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality would not be allowed to enforce three provisions in the state’s general permits for concentrated animal feeding operations that were forged as part of a civil rights settlement.
Instead, those three requirements for certain farms—groundwater monitoring, annual reporting and soil testing for phosphorus loss—would have to go through a more extensive rule-making process led by the Environmental Management Commission.
The EMC is composed of political appointees, whose appetite for regulation varies.
“This case presents a foundational question of administrative accountability whether state agencies may sidestep the safeguards of rulemaking by imposing sweeping regulatory mandates through general permits,” the Farm Bureau Federation attorneys wrote in court documents.
The case stems from several settlement conditions contained within a 2014 civil rights complaint. Lawyers for several environmental justice groups and neighbors of industrialized hog farms had filed a complaint with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, alleging that DEQ, by issuing general permits without adequate protections, disproportionately burdened people of color and low-income residents, who are more likely to live near the farms.
Most of the state’s concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, hold a general permit, which applies to a class of operations. A smaller number have individual permits, whose conditions are tailored to specific farms. DEQ renews and, if necessary, revises general permits every five years, after several public hearings and opportunities to comment.
As part of the settlement, DEQ incorporated three conditions in a 2019 general permit.

All CAFOs must file a two-page annual report summarizing information from existing records, such as the number of animals, permitted lagoons and acres on which waste is applied.
CAFOs whose lagoons or waste collection systems lie within a 100-year flood plain must conduct annual groundwater monitoring; this accounts for fewer than 3 percent of general permit holders, according to DEQ.
Based on soil testing, some CAFOs would have to measure phosphorus loss from their fields where animal waste is applied. This requirement would affect roughly 5 percent of CAFOs.

Groundwater monitoring is important because runoff or leakage from enormous hog waste lagoons can seep into private drinking water wells or rivers and streams. Annual reporting, environmental groups argued, can detect problems at the CAFOs sooner.
Phosphorus loss tests are key because they can indicate erosion or runoff from the farms, which in turn can create harmful algae blooms in waterways.
  This map shows the locations of all permitted concentrated animal feeding operations in North Carolina. In total, these farms raise 86,000 cattle and cows, 9.45 million swine, and 7.19 million poultry where the animal waste is stored and applied as a liquid. The map does not show the millions of poultry on farms that use dry waste systems; those farms aren’t required to obtain a permit. (Credit: N.C. Department of Environmental Quality)
The N.C. Farm Bureau Federation contested those aspects of the general permit before an administrative law judge, who ruled in its favor.
DEQ appealed to Wake County Superior Court, which reversed the administrative law judge’s ruling. The Farm Bureau subsequently won in state appellate court.
For 28 years the state legislature has enacted and revised statutes allowing DEQ and other agencies to write and issue general permits without going through rulemaking, a process that can take years.
Only if a provision has “general applicability” does it need to be a rule.
Associate Justice Trey Allen, a Republican, agreed that state lawmakers granted some permitting authority to state agencies, but said “it’s difficult for me to believe GA’s intent was to enable the agency to avoid rulemaking.”
“These permit conditions do not have general applicability,” said Taylor Crabtree, an attorney with the N.C. Department of Justice representing DEQ. Even though the permits are “general,” farmers can apply for an individual permit instead, Crabtree said, and potentially avoid the three provisions in dispute.
State law also requires every requirement in a general permit to tie back to a specific condition or statute, which the three provisions achieve, Crabtree said.
DEQ’s actions for the three provisions, Republican Associate Judge Richard Dietz said, “sound like rulemaking.”
Dietz said that while the legislature has the authority to delegate some rulemaking to the executive branch, such as DEQ, that power has limits, such as procedural safeguards.
A farm can still challenge the permit conditions in court, Crabtree told the justices. “It’s not accurate to say this regime has no procedural safeguards.”
Jacob Parker, attorney for the Farm Bureau Federation, argued without the guardrails of formal rule-making, “an agency can go off into its black box and make decisions” about what to include in permits, “which we contend is what sort of happened here with the sue and settle issue.”
The “sue and settle issue” is the 2014 civil rights complaint against DEQ, which the EPA determined was valid. The EPA directed DEQ and environmental groups to enter confidential mediation, but those talks broke down in 2016, when agency officials in a conservative administration allowed the NC Pork Council to attend a confidential mediation session. ??
Attorneys for the neighbors and environmental groups asked the pork industry representatives to leave the building. Instead they stayed in the hallway near the mediation room during the talks, according to a second complaint, a move that neighbors alleged was a form of intimidation.
The EPA found the second complaint to be valid and wrote in a letter to DEQ that it had “grave concerns” about the incidents.
Two years later, under new DEQ Secretary Michael Regan, the parties reached a settlement. Regan went on to become EPA administrator under President Joe Biden.
Parker, the Farm Bureau Federation attorney, told the court today that “absent the farm interests, we ended up with a draft swine permit with conditions that had not been adopted as rules.” Unlike rules, the conditions contained no fiscal note, so farmers didn’t know how much compliance would cost, Parker said.
Associate Justice Anita Earls, one of two Democrats on the bench, asked about the possible ramifications on DEQ’s other 21 general permits as well as all state agencies. “If we were to say the conditions for the permitting process here have to go through rulemaking … would these extend beyond DEQ?”
Crabtree, the DEQ attorney, replied that if the scope of the opinion is broad, it could affect all state agencies that issue general permits. “It would work a great deal of uncertainty into the system,” Crabtree said. In that case, any statutory clarifications should fall to state lawmakers, he said. “If there’s a change, it’s an argument for the General Assembly, not the courts.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hog-Farm-eastern-NC-Rick-Dove-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

SPRINGFIELD – The cost to attend state universities has been rising, and some institutions have said they’ll have to continue pushing the brunt of state budget shortfalls onto students and families if there isn’t a change.

Data from the Illinois Board of Higher Education, which oversees public universities, shows university income has had to make up for the steady loss of funding from the state since around fiscal year 2009 as compared to inflation.

Since that point, state investment hasn’t kept up with inflation, and tuition and fees have risen steadily despite the fact that Gov. JB Pritzker’s administration has regularly increased higher education funding. The fiscal year 2026 proposed budget includes a 3% increase for higher education in the general fund for operating costs – which is about the same as the rate of inflation.

The cost of tuition and fees for statewide undergraduates on average has risen 10% higher since FY09 than if it had simply kept pace with inflation. For graduate students, that discrepancy is 16%.

The University of Illinois Chicago is the only school that has seen tuition and fees for both graduate and undergraduate students grow more slowly than inflation.

Administrators from many of the states’ universities have said they’re holding out hope that a new funding formula, contained in Senate Bill 13 and House Bill 1581, will alleviate some financial burden.

The formula as it is currently proposed would use data from the Illinois Board of Higher Education to determine how much money public universities would need on a per-student basis. University officials said the current system for allocating funds to universities isn’t quite as clear about determining why one university gets more funding than any other.

During a Senate appropriations hearing last week, Sen. Michael Halpin, D-Rock Island, and Northern Illinois University President Lisa Freeman each supported a data-based funding formula over the current method.

Administrators for almost every public state university who have spoken to the same committee have said they need to keep asking for more money than what the governor proposed in order to fend off tuition and fee increases.

“We understand funds are more constrictive this year than in the recent past,” said Eastern Illinois University President Jay Gatrell during the committee meeting. “That said, we do have bills to pay, and we only have two real sources of revenue: state appropriations, which cover roughly one-third of our operating costs, and student tuition and fees, which cover the remaining two-thirds.”

During fiscal year 2003, that breakdown was flipped – the state covered more than two-thirds of universities’ operating costs.

“No university really wants to increase tuition cost,” said Corey Bradford, interim president of Governors State University in an interview. “We do it in order to balance our budgets.”

The proposed funding formula hasn’t made its way through either chamber yet, though legislators generally have ways of moving major legislation beyond stated bill deadlines, up until end-of-May adjournment. If it doesn’t move, universities will continue being appropriated funds by standards set from years past.

“Even if there are differences in dollars per FTE (full time equivalency student) after we were to implement this formula, at least those differences would be grounded in this data in the program,” Halpin said. “Right now, we have these discrepancies, but there’s … not necessarily a hard data point, or set of data points, to justify it.”

 

MAP grants

In his February budget plan, Pritzker proposed increased funding of $10 million for Monetary Award Program grants for students to use toward tuition and fees, matching the same increase he made for the previous year’s budget.

MAP grants can go to any student who’s eligible for financial aid across the state. Pritzker’s proposed increase would make the new MAP grants pool total $721.6 million – up from $400 million when he was first elected in 2019.

However, MAP grants don’t directly fund universities the same way money from the general fund does.

“MAP goes to all colleges,” Bradford said. “Community colleges, private colleges, it doesn’t all come to public universities.”

 

University building projects

Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, asked every university president during recent committee hearings if their schools had received any funding for deferred maintenance projects on campuses for the current fiscal year.

Rose said no one has said “yes” yet.

“I think we’d like to know before we get to next year’s budget how we’re spending last year’s budget,” Rose said. The current budget year concludes on June 30.

Ginger Ostro, IBHE’s executive director, said the board is working with universities and meeting with them and the Illinois Capital Development Board to maintain lists about deferred maintenance projects and make sure funding is distributed.

Proponents of Senate Bill 2 from Sen. “Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, leaned on data and research that blames fluoride for thyroid disorders and lowering the IQ of children (we’ll circle back to that later). The proposal advanced last Wednesday from the Senate Committee of Health and Welfare in a 6-3 party line vote, with Republicans prevailing. 
The results were the same for another Fesi bill to authorize the over-the-counter sale of ivermectin at pharmacies without a doctor’s prescription. As with the anti-fluoride bill, ivermectin supporters had ample info to support their viewpoint (we’ll get back to this, too).
Yet despite this apparent pro-science and pro-research mindset, overwhelming evidence of higher rates of cancer and other chronic ailments in communities along the Mississippi River’s petrochemical corridor in Louisiana are routinely ignored – if not doubted – within conservative circles.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Just three years ago, a peer-reviewed Tulane Environmental Law Clinic study found the estimated cancer risk was highest in the River Parish communities right next to point sources of pollution. Most of these settlements are predominantly Black and low-income, inhabited in part by the descendants of slaves who toiled on the plantations where refineries and chemical plants now stand.
The same study found the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) issued permits to allow industrial pollution emissions at rates 7 to 21 times higher among Black communities than in predominantly white ones. 
According to 2024 health data research from Human Rights Watch, people living in areas with the worst air pollution in Louisiana, including much of “Cancer Alley,” had rates of low birthweight more than double the state average (11.3%) and more than triple the U.S. average (8.5%). Preterm births were nearly double the state average (13%) and nearly two-and-a-half times the national rate (10.5%).
State officials are not willing to acknowledge the disparities. 
“LDEQ does not use the term Cancer Alley,” a department spokesperson told Human Rights Watch last year. “That term implies that there is a large geographic area that has higher cancer incidence than the state average. We have not seen higher cancer incidence over large areas of the industrial corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans.”
Now let’s go back to last week’s Senate committee hearing to see if we can’t connect that statement to why state officials can’t – or won’t – acknowledge verified scientific facts that are staring them in the face.
That includes state Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham, who was by Fesi’s side to support both of his bills. Regarding the removal of fluoride from drinking water, Abraham said there “probably is a direct correlation between fluoride intake in pregnant ladies and lower IQs in their babies.” Crowley chiropractor Sandra Marks, who also testified in favor of the bill, made the same claim and cited a Harvard School of Public Health study.
What Abraham and Marks didn’t share was that the Harvard study involved children in China with high overexposure to fluoride. They implied the lower IQs were tied to exposure to permissible levels of fluoride in the U.S. 
Jeanie Donovan, New Orleans deputy health department director, shared details on the Harvard research with lawmakers when testifying against Fesi’s bill. She also pointed out the lack of any reliable scientific research that connects fluoride with thyroid disease. 
“We have many, many health issues in our city and in our state that we should address and that we should be spending time and money to address,” Donovan told the committee, making it clear that fluoride overexposure was not one of them. 
Anne Jayes with the Louisiana Public Health Institute and Dr. Robert Delarosa, a Baton Rouge pediatric dentist for 41 years, both cited a University of Queensland study that found children with access to properly fluoridated water had higher IQs. 
Marks, who said her research was sourced through Meta AI, also sounded the alarm over skeletal fluorosis, which can result in bone density changes and an increased risk of fractures. What she failed to mention was the bone disorder involves exposure to excessive amounts of fluoride. 
Jayes later pointed out the potentially dangerous fluoride levels in the study Marks cited were 21 to 28 times the recommended amount for drinking water systems, and that skeletal fluorosis studies themselves have been “widely challenged for their poor quality.”    
Annette Droddy, executive director of the 1,900-member Louisiana Dental Association, noted to the committee a trend of states reversing their bans on fluoridated drinking water, including Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Tennessee. 
Calgary, Alberta, removed fluoride from its water in 2011 but restored it in 2023, Droddy said. The reversal came after health officials noted a 700% increase in children hospitalized for dental inflections and abscesses.
In Louisiana, only 39% of the population is provided fluoridated water through their public utility – well below the 72% national average, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Removing fluoride will compound issues for the nearly 500,000 children in Louisiana who don’t see a dentist regularly, even though they qualify for dental coverage through Medicaid, Droddy said. Without fluoridated water, she said the state will have to ask the federal government for more money to cover a likely increase in children’s dental problems.
“Why would we take away the best public health measure of the 20th century?” Droddy said.
Yet Fesi stuck to his guns in his closing statement for Senate Bill 2, doubling down on the debunked low IQ and thyroid claims — and adding autism for good measure without any supporting evidence. 
On Fesi’s other bill, Abraham provided what he called a “guesstimate,” saying “a fairly large percentage of the population of the United States takes ivermectin on a daily basis.”
The most recent number available for daily ivermectin use in the U.S. is 185,550 people, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Hospitals. 
That’s only 0.05% of the national population; it’s not nothing but certainly not “a fairly large percentage” of Americans. That poor grasp of health data might be cause for concern among Abraham’s patients – animal and human.
The surgeon general and other backers of Fesi’s bill frequently mentioned “health freedom” during the Senate committee hearing. That concept apparently doesn’t apply to neighbors of industrial facilities who no doubt would like freedom from toxic exposure linked to chronic ailments and a significantly lowered quality and length of life.
Fesi also referred to fluoride as “toxic waste,” something that communities along the river could probably help him better define.   
If Louisiana leaders are going to pull fluoride out of our drinking water, it stands to reason they should show equal concern for the health of residents in “Cancer Alley.”

It’s hard to believe, but it’s now been nearly six months since the November 2024 election and one race remains officially undecided – the contest for an associate justice seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court. Two recounts have confirmed that incumbent Justice Allison Riggs was the narrow victor, but remarkably, challenger Jefferson Griffin refuses to concede and continues to pursue the audacious strategy of seeking to have thousands of ballots – ballots cast according to the rules in effect on Election Day – thrown out.
The challenge has led to multiple lawsuits and numerous state and federal court rulings and recently, in order to try and get a handle on where things stand, what’s at stake and what might happen next, NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with one of our state’s top good government champions, Common Cause of North Carolina Policy Director, Ann Webb.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.










I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University


GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Two volunteers pretend to cook over a stove when another pair acting as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents comes knocking at the cardboard cutout of a door.
This is the set up for a skit that undocumented advocates put on at their Know Your Rights training sessions. Rojas helps organize them.
“I am committed to waking my people up so they know that he, she or they can share with others their rights,” Rojas said.
Rojas is an immigrant who is actively involved with the undocumented community in her city. She’s asked to not use her full name for the safety of herself and the undocumented community she works with.
She’s worried because of recent allegations that federal immigration officers have wrongfully detained residents in New England and beyond. At Boston Logan Airport recently, two people with legal immigration status were detained. One had a green card and was detained. The other had a legal work visa and was deported.
“It makes me nervous,” Rojas said in Spanish. “It makes me think of how we can be even more strategic with these kinds of attacks.”
Part of that strategy is teaching people their constitutional rights, because she said it’s now more important than ever for people to know how to use them if they ever interact with an ICE agent.
“Being out and about is scary, but I am committed to planting those seeds, because I know they’ll bloom,” Rojas said.
Blah-blah-blah, cha-cha-cha and practice
The Know Your Rights workshop Rojas and her fellow activists put on has three parts. She calls them the “blah, blah, blah”, the “cha, cha, cha” and then “practice, practice, practice.”
The “blah, blah, blah” is a lecture in which activists explicitly tell audience members their rights. The New Haven Immigrants Coalition has a slideshow presentation with the majority of the constitutional rights that Rojas goes over in her own presentation. It is available in English and Spanish.
Trainees then get to see these rights in action with skits, during the “cha, cha, cha” portion of the workshop.
“The skit is a theatrical way to get as close as we can to reality and to expose our trainees in different scenarios so they can think about it, feel about it, and then practice it,” Rojas said.

Scenarios include what to do when you are at home, in your car, at your workplace and when you’re in a public area.
Rojas and her team provide handout copies of a legitimate court-ordered warrant signed by a judge and an ICE administrative order. With an administrative order, you do not need to open the door, Rojas said, but it is a common tactic immigration agents use to gain entry into someone’s home, so it’s important to know the distinction.
“If [the ICE agents] come with different tricks, just don’t fall for it,” Rojas said. “If [the agents] say, ‘We have here a document that proves that we can get into your house.’ [You should say] ‘Okay, just slide it [under] the door.’”
Then comes “practice, practice, practice.”
Rojas has all the trainees line up in pairs with partners facing each other. With one person as themselves and the other person as an ICE agent, they’ll practice the skills they’ve learned using different scenarios that Rojas poses.
The ‘each one teach one’ approach
This April, Rojas’ advocacy group is starting a new program called “Train the Trainer.” The idea is to train people how to give these Know Your Rights workshops.
“This is intended to be in the safety of your house,” she said. Imagine it like a gathering, she said, where Mexican sweet corn cake and coffee is served.
“We are going to have tomalitos, café and know your rights,” Rojas said. The goal is to offer training sessions to people who are too afraid to go out in public.
“Can you imagine if we can train 40 people this time, and then the next session, they invite one, just one, one of the people that they train to come to another ‘Train the Trainer?’ Now we are going to have 80 people,” she said. “It makes a huge difference.”
Prepare a layered defense
At Castle Church in Norwich, Philip Berns was giving a Know Your Rights presentation with the Latino advocacy group LEAD late into the night in March. The people in the audience either spoke English, Spanish or Haitian Creole. Thankfully, Berns speaks all three languages.
Berns, an immigration attorney based in Stamford, has been giving Know Your Rights presentations since 2006. When President Donald Trump returned to office, Berns ramped up to offer about two presentations a week.
He likes to teach people a strategy for how to use a red card (la tarjeta roja). Think of it like a business card, but instead of your contact information, it has your constitutional rights listed. You can give it to an immigration agent if you’re unable to verbally state your rights, he said.

He recommends having at least six red cards on hand at all times and to give them out to each agent you interact with, but he said you should save the last one for the deportation judge to show that if you were detained, it was done while violating your constitutional rights.
“You just have to be ready to have a layered defense,” Berns said.
Knowing which of your rights were violated is the best way to defend yourself when facing a deportation judge if you end up detained, which is why, Berns said, Know Your Rights training is still “absolutely” important regardless of the cases of alleged wrongful detentions.
It also helps to have a video recording of the interaction with the immigration agent, Berns said, another right that Berns teaches people they have.
“They’re going to take your phone away from you, so you’re not gonna be able to record it yourself,” he said. “It’s going to have to be other people.”
That’s where bystanders can act as allies, he said.
Open the door to your community
Both Berns and Rojas agree that these workshops are not just for the undocumented. They’re for family members, friends and neighbors, regardless of immigration status.
“If you know your rights, you know that you don’t have to open the door, and that is the single biggest line of defense you have against [ICE agents] picking up anybody they’re looking for,” Berns said. “For all the other people in the house that [the ICE agents] are not looking for, but I suspect will likely pick up just to drive their numbers up, if they know their rights, then they can protect themselves against deportation [too].”
In Spanish, Rojas and her fellow activists have a saying.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.










I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, Campbell University chair of family medicine


GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Norman served as secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment throughout the pandemic. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Five years ago, Lee Norman was trying to dissuade Kansans from ingesting chemical cleaners to prevent COVID-19, preparing for the end of a statewide stay-at-home order and deciding whether to send tests for everyone in long-term care facilities and prisons.
Norman, then secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, jokes that reflecting on those years is like taking “a walk down bad memory lane.”
“We were meeting 24/7, 365,” Norman said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “And trying to figure out — without having enough resources, without having (a) vaccine, without having any medications and without having any testing — what the heck we were going to do with this lethal virus that has now landed in the United States.”


Within two years of the first cases in Kansas, Norman stepped down from his cabinet post at the request of Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration.
The first case was recorded March 7, 2020, and about a week later, Kelly declared a state of emergency.
Less than a week after that, she ordered K-12 schools closed.
By the end of the month, national case counts inched toward 100,000, deaths reached 1,000, President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus bill and Kelly issued a stay-at-home order for the entire state.
The first four weeks went “swimmingly well,” even amid uncertainty and shock, Norman said.
But, he said, things quickly became contentious as executive action from the governor, public health recommendations and attempts at understanding a brand new virus unfolded.
“You know, four weeks was pretty unusual to have that kind of engagement,” he said. “And after that, it became distinctly unfun.”
He admitted public health was slow to address the social and psychological impacts of the pandemic. But by the point he and other public health officials realized that, he said, resistance to following public health guidance had already begun to take shape.
The politicization that crept into Norman’s role during the COVID-19 pandemic still exists in public health today. The 2025 Kansas Legislature passed bills in April that hinder the governor’s authority to limit public gatherings and pare back vaccination requirements for children.
Norman, who now works in the private sector, said investing in public health infrastructure is key for preparing for future health crises.
As Kansans faced last year a spike in tuberculosis cases and more recently a growing measles outbreak, Norman emphasized the importance of vaccinations and adhering to public health guidance.
The governor signed into law in April modifications to vaccine requirements for children that make it easier for parents to claim religious exemptions as justification for their unvaccinated children. The governor vetoed another piece of legislation that created a pathway for people to sue state and county health officials for their decisions about quarantines and other public health guidance. The Legislature overrode Kelly’s veto, making the change law.
Masks and limiting large gatherings work, Norman said. They have for centuries, he added.
“Half of everybody, kind of wants to undo the benefits of public health, and mock it even, which is particularly hurtful,” Norman said. “I think that the Legislature needs to, one, respect personal autonomy and responsibility, and then secondly, if people are want to have more autonomy, I think they have to listen to very, very good guidance.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PC303579-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

A few weeks after the birth, the two were temporarily separated. Hailey poses for a portrait after being temporarily reunited with her daughter on April 1 in Cuba. Asked what she misses most, Hailey replied: “Her smiling.” (Photo by Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent)CUBA, Mo. — Hailey cradled her cat like a baby and nuzzled his fur. It wasn’t long before he rejected the attention and leapt from her arms in the callous way cats do. She cursed him in the way hormonal teenagers do.
Ash, a gray stray Hailey took in against her great-aunt’s protesting, became the teen’s comfort through a pregnancy and postpartum that spanned 10 foster homes, hospitals and group homes across Missouri.
Hailey entered the state foster system at 2 years old. She’s lost count of how many roofs she’s slept under.
Last spring at 15 years old, Hailey learned she was pregnant.
When she asked the state for an abortion, Hailey was told the possibility wasn’t up for discussion. By the time her stomach started to bulge, Missourians voted to codify the right to abortion in the state Constitution, and Hailey decided she wanted to parent.
But it wasn’t so simple.
By then, Hailey was staying with her great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, but the state remained her legal guardian. Though Hailey took initiative to prepare for motherhood, caseworkers on several occasions during her pregnancy threatened to take the baby after she was born, rolling out examples from Hailey’s long history in the state’s care.
In late February, just a few weeks after Hailey turned 16, her daughter was born. The resemblance is unmistakable: vibrant red locks, pale skin and blue eyes.
From the moment her baby girl entered the world, Hailey feared the state would take her. While that hasn’t happened permanently, the state did temporarily separate the young mother and child, moving them to different cities in different corners of the state.
By eight weeks postpartum, Hailey had slept in two hospitals and four homes.
Desperate to reunite her child with family as she was shuffled around the foster system, Hailey signed power of attorney of her daughter over to Spradley, to whom she also wanted to return.
In early April, after months of protesting the state’s push to move her into a faith-based maternity home, Hailey acquiesced. It allowed her to reunite with her daughter.
A few weeks later, on the eve of a court hearing to discuss her permanent placement, Hailey ran away from the maternity home with her 6-week-old in her arms. Both were quickly found and returned to state custody.
Hailey said she fled, in part, out of fear the state would officially declare she couldn’t live with Spradley. And she was terrified about where they might send her next.
The family’s fate remains uncertain.
Missouri has long been one of the most anti-abortion states in the country, with elected officials and advocates preaching the virtue of supporting young mothers to ensure abortion isn’t their only option.
But Hailey said this sentiment is a far cry from her experience. To her, it felt like the state first made the decision to continue the pregnancy for her, then actively worked to keep her from parenting her child.
The Independent spent months following Hailey and reviewing communications between her, Spradley, their advocates and the state that spanned Hailey’s pregnancy and postpartum.
The record of her struggles in the system illustrate what youth advocates and foster care experts say are repeated failures by the state to support Hailey, and later her daughter.
“Hailey was saying she wanted to parent, so she should have been supported,” said Laura Sullivan, a licensed independent social worker in Ohio who has spent several months advocating for Hailey. “In these states where they’re forcing pregnancies, especially teen pregnancies, they have to be ready to help these moms to parent.”
A spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Social Services, which oversees the state foster care system, said she could not discuss the specifics of Hailey’s case, instead pointing to Missouri’s Child Welfare Manual.
 ‘Don’t get pregnant’

The Facebook message came from a stranger.
“I have a child on my caseload who I believe is a relative to you,” an employee with a Missouri foster care agency wrote the morning of May 21, 2024.
Within hours, the state cleared and authorized Spradley to take her niece in under a temporary arrangement. Hailey was on her doorstep by that evening.
A letter dated that same day stated that while Hailey remained in the custody of Children’s Division, she was being placed with Spradley for an “indeterminate period.”
Though filled with gaps, the aunt and niece have a long history. Spradley used to take Hailey to the St. Louis Zoo, propping her up against the wooden railings to catch a glimpse of the animals. As Hailey got older, Spradley would take her driving around different corners of southeast Missouri to get ice cream or go to a park.
At times they went years without seeing one another. Though another great-aunt of Hailey’s — Spradley’s sister — adopted Hailey when she was 4, Hailey spent much of her childhood shuffled between different foster homes and mental hospitals.

She was a flight risk almost everywhere she went until she landed at Spradley’s.
“Don’t get pregnant,” Hailey recalled Spradley telling her when she moved in.
A few weeks later, Hailey went to the doctor to confirm what she feared. Hailey, who only a few months earlier had turned 15, was pregnant.
She wanted an abortion in the beginning. When Hailey asked her case worker if it was possible, she was told the state wasn’t allowed to discuss it with her. Abortion at the time remained illegal in Missouri with limited exceptions for medical emergencies.
Hailey couldn’t get up the nerve to tell Spradley she was pregnant, so she made a friend break the news instead. But Spradley didn’t kick her out. She doubled down on her desire to help.
Spradley searched the internet for answers. She sent a note to JustChoice — an agency based out of Ohio that helps people create abortion, adoption or parenting plans — saying her niece had been denied an abortion and now wanted to raise her child.
There was just one problem, Spradley said: Though months from her due date, the state was already threatening to take away Hailey’s baby.
 ‘We’re going to remove that baby’

Sullivan, the licensed independent social worker at JustChoice, reached out to Spradley after her organization received her message in late 2024. With Spradley’s permission, she started communicating with Hailey’s case worker to talk about a parenting plan.
Sullivan recalls the case worker in their initial calls telling her: “I don’t think Hailey’s going to be able to parent. We’re going to remove that baby. Her and her aunt, this is not a stable situation; they have a long history with the agency.’”
Most urgent, the case worker told Sullivan, was Spradley’s lack of adequate housing. If she wanted to maintain custody of Hailey through her pregnancy, she needed somewhere else to live.
After staying with a friend in St. Louis, Spradley and Hailey moved into the home and church of a former pastor in Wright City. Some of Spradley’s friends had pointed them to the old building off a rural highway as emergency accommodations.
The house, which abutted woods and farmland, sat untouched after the pastor died months earlier.
In the main room, religious relics crowded the wall. Behind one closed door was what Hailey dubbed the “porn room,” after they found explicit images on an abandoned computer. Hailey slept upstairs beneath old posters of semi trucks plastered to the walls.
The lack of heat became a growing concern as winter approached.
The state began talking of removing Hailey from Spradley’s care; a faith-based maternity home in the St. Louis suburbs that contracts with the state was suggested. Hailey remained adamant she didn’t want to go. When her case worker recommended she have bags packed and by the door the week of Christmas, she listened.
But she also shut down, growing moodier as the looming threat of removal hung over the holidays.
The new year came and went. Hailey’s bags remained by the door. The state never stopped by.
Sullivan, searching for a solution, teamed up with Right By You, an “all options” nonprofit focused on helping pregnant youth, to raise money for Spradley to rent an upgraded apartment.
Within weeks, Right By You raised $5,000 — primarily through Missouri donors and abortion funds — to cover Spradley’s rent through May. Meanwhile, Sullivan worked the phones with Spradley, calling landlords in an attempt to find someone who would accept a pregnant teen, a 52-year-old on disability, two dogs and one cat.
She found a solution in Cuba, a town about 80 miles southwest of St. Louis.
By mid-January, Hailey and Spradley were moved into a small, unadorned two-bedroom apartment.
Spradley reached out to her network of friends, asking if they could help furnish the apartment with baby essentials as a birthday surprise for Hailey, who turned 16 in late January.
They came by the truck-load, dropping off strollers, onesies and a swing. Spradley used some of the disability back-pay she received to splurge on a crib and a bottle sanitizer.
In the end, it still wasn’t enough.
 ‘Where are you going to live?’

Spradley didn’t take Hailey in sooner for many reasons. Poverty and poor health were the most prevailing.
“So what’s your plan for where you are going to live?” Hailey’s case worker asked in a text to Spradley months earlier, shortly after Hailey learned she was pregnant. “Do you have any money saved?”
“I had absolutely no income when Hailey was brought to me,” Spradley replied. “Not a dime. I get SSI disability which is very little.”
But once together, Hailey didn’t want to leave. Finally, someone understood her — a sarcastic and brash teen with a tendency to raise her voice.
“Some people would see what she’s doing and would freak out, but they don’t understand what she’s grown up and what she’s went through,” Spradley said. “That’s why I don’t judge her on that. That’s the big difference between me and other people.”
Unlike a foster parent, Spradley didn’t receive consistent financial benefits from the state for taking Hailey in. Though she attempted on several occasions to get certified as a foster parent through the state, she never received the final approval.
Spradley suspects it’s because she’s poor and sick.
She’s often seized by anxiety, which she said has only worsened since beginning to navigate the state’s hurdles in her attempts to help Hailey. She suffers from agoraphobia, Crohn’s disease, heart conditions and often uses a walker.
Spradley attributed some of her ailments to growing up in Times Beach, Missouri. It’s now a ghost town, beset by a chemical contamination that came to light in the 1980s. The Environmental Protection Agency deemed it “one of the worst environmental disasters in our nation’s history.”
Hailey is as determined as her aunt.
She enrolled in teen parenting classes through Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis as she started her second trimester. Between that and her prenatal appointments, she made weekly trips to St. Louis through her third trimester.
Most weeks, she made the trip without Spradley, booking and boarding a van through MO HealthNet, the state’s Medicaid program. The vehicle usually picked up other patients along the way, stretching what was normally a 90-minute drive into multiple hours.
The state on several occasions expressed concern with this arrangement, telling both Spradley and Sullivan that Hailey needed constant supervision.
Instead, Spradley kept an eye on Hailey’s location from an app on her cell phone.
Every year, Missouri social services agencies seize millions of dollars in Social Security benefits from foster children. Hailey is among them.
When Sullivan questioned how the state was using Hailey’s payments, which typically go toward funding foster care, she was told it was being used to pay for Medicaid expenses and the van rides.
She remains skeptical. That $400 a month could have gone a long way to help Spradley purchase furniture and buy groceries, both of which she said were held against her toward the end of Hailey’s pregnancy.
 Birth, ‘then I was out’

Days before Hailey went into labor, the state followed through on its threat.
Hailey was removed from Spradley’s apartment in Cuba and sent to a private foster home near St. Louis.
The foster mother, a stranger, drove her to the hospital. Once settled into a room, Hailey said the foster parent told her she was running down to the cafeteria.
Instead, she left Hailey at the hospital and never returned.
Hailey’s daughter was born two days later, on Feb. 26. The moment of joy was brief; within minutes, Hailey lost consciousness.
“I had a whole asthma attack, then I ended up throwing up everything in my stomach, and then shaking so bad that my jaw was hurting,” she said. “Then I was out.”
It took two blood transfusions to stem her postpartum hemorrhage.
Hailey ultimately stayed in the hospital for 12 days. Not because of her health, she said, but because the state didn’t know where else to send her.
This isn’t uncommon. In 2024, there were 314 Missouri foster children residing in hospitals. Others were held in hotels, offices and out-of-state residential treatment facilities.

While at the hospital, Hailey learned how to breastfeed. She believes her daughter shares her own lactose intolerance since she doesn’t take well to most formulas.
In many ways the two girls resemble Hailey’s mother, who was found dead in 2011, two years after Hailey had been removed from her custody. She was in the third trimester of pregnancy with a second daughter, who didn’t survive. The autopsy concluded a drug overdose. Spradley still believes it was something more nefarious.
A few months before Hailey gave birth, she asked Spradley if she could see the place where her mom died. They drove 60 miles to the apartment and asked the current tenant if they could look around. Hailey asked lots of questions. Spradley hoped it was healing.
She tries to tell Hailey stories of her mother often. Like the time Hailey’s mother, while pregnant with her, found a free mini fridge at a scrap sale and walked miles home with it. She later did the same with a kiddie pool.
Hailey doesn’t know her father. She hopes her daughter won’t, either.
The line for “father” on the birth certificate is blank, as Hailey intended.
She says little about the 20-year-old other than that they first met at a foster home years earlier, that he beat her and that he was, for a time, homeless.
Multiple warrants are out for his arrest, including for failure to appear in court on trespassing and theft charges.
Throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, one of Spradley’s closest friends, Brandie Coleman, was among her fiercest defenders. When Hailey gave birth, Coleman was by her side, Facetiming with Spradley, who feared the state might punish her for being there.
As Hailey recovered from her hemorrhage, Coleman says a hospital social worker confided in her that a state case worker had been trying to convince her to report Hailey to child protective services so they could remove her baby. But Coleman says the hospital employee refused, not seeing any evidence of abuse or neglect.
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, the Missouri-based reproductive rights group that helped fundraise for Hailey and Spradley, said the family’s self-advocacy was admirable.
And in a way, she believes, they were punished for it.
She called Hailey’s case “such a blatant example of a pregnancy literally forced by the state, and then a very clear bias against this person and this notion that her child would be better off with a different family, and she was told that explicitly. And I just honestly was a little bit surprised how unveiled that was. There wasn’t really any pretense about it.” 
  Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, called Hailey a “forceful self advocate,” adding: “It’s really admirable for someone so young, who’s in such a disempowered situation.” (Photo by Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent)
Kraft Sheley, who is also an attorney, said the fact that Hailey had a family member who wanted to take her in — who understood her — was huge. That Hailey was deprived of that support in the days leading up to and after her labor was “such inhumanity.”
“For any person to lose their home and be ripped away from their loved one within three days, four days of giving birth, one of the most formative, transformational experiences of a person’s life, she was treated with such a lack of care,” Kraft Sheley said. “… As a teen in such a vulnerable situation, she deserved to be held and surrounded by care, and instead, she was placed in this really precarious, uncertain situation.”
 Postpartum ‘disrupted’

When Hailey was finally discharged from the hospital, she and her baby were driven 200 miles southwest to Springfield.
There, they were placed in a private foster home with other teen moms.
Less than a week later, Hailey called Spradley. She was being taken to a mental health hospital to be screened for postpartum depression. Hailey said she was told it was because the foster parent heard her yelling; Hailey said she was yelling at a friend on the phone, not at her baby.
“I never heard this kid cry like she did,” Spradley said of Hailey during the phone call.
Her daughter was napping when they took Hailey away.
At the hospital, Hailey said she didn’t screen positive for postpartum depression but was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, meaning she has stronger emotional or behavioral responses to stress and trauma.
Hailey said when she learned she was being admitted to the hospital without her daughter, she had to be sedated after she started “throwing hands” at staff. She remained there for six days.
Spradley had little contact with Hailey in the hospital once her phone was taken away. When Hailey was released, she signed power of attorney for her daughter over to Spradley.
As Spradley drove to pick up Hailey’s child, Hailey was taken to yet another location — this time a group home in southeast Missouri.
Hailey believes the separation from her daughter was intentional. Within the first month of her child’s life, the two had been apart nearly as much as they’d been together.
She tried to continue pumping breast milk. At the start of her third trimester, Hailey had already started collecting small bottles of colostrum. But it didn’t take long after being separated from her daughter for her milk supply to diminish.

“For a teen mom, especially one with attachment issues like Hailey has, to be able to breastfeed successfully, that is beautiful and amazing, and could have been really healing,” Sullivan said. “But it was disrupted. So that caused both Hailey harm and (her daughter) harm.”
Sullivan, who has also worked as a social worker in two states, said it’s easy to use a teen’s years-long history in the system against them unfairly. She doesn’t believe Missouri ever gave Hailey a fair chance.
“Instead of being like, ‘This is a kid who we know has a lot of trauma and a lot of stuff, we should probably try to figure out how we’re going to help her parent and heal so she can be a good parent,’” Sullivan said. “‘It was just, ‘We’re on a mission to make her not be able to parent.’”
 ‘I’m not giving up on you’

On a sunny day in early April, Hailey returned to her aunt’s home in Cuba.
For the second time in a week, she held her daughter, who was one day shy of 5 weeks old.
Hailey’s milk supply had mostly dried up. She considered attempting to breastfeed, but then opted to make a bottle instead.
“Has she given you all the stink face yet?” Hailey asked as Spradley confirmed with a chuckle.
“Good. That’s my child,” Hailey replied, smiling down at her daughter as she fed her.
She sat in her old room again, across from stickers adhered to the wall welcoming her baby home. She urged the dogs to be careful as they investigated her baby’s scent. She cuddled her cat.
It was all temporary.

Hailey was back for just part of the day on an authorized off-site visit. A few hours later, Spradley would drive her 90 minutes back to the group home where Hailey would again kiss her baby goodbye.
Until then, she changed diapers, went through paperwork and sorted baby clothes, a sense of normalcy in a life that had been anything but.
As Hailey lounged on the couch with her daughter and Spradley rocked her small dog, named Baby, in the corner, Spradley’s cell phone rang. At the sight of the caller ID, an old friend of Spradley’s, Hailey perked up and grabbed for the phone to say hello.
“You know what? I love the sound of your voice right now. You sound so happy,” Spradley’s friend said to Hailey before pausing. “Honestly, are you doing OK?”
“Not for good, sadly,” Hailey said. “Jodi kidnapped me for the day though.”
She outlined her plan to return permanently to her daughter. The first step was the maternity home she initially resisted. It was her only option she saw to parent.
Less than a week later she checked into the St. Louis area facility. Spradley met her in the lobby with the baby.
The past several months have been hard on Spradley. Anxiety attacks bare themselves in the middle of the night. She worries over Hailey and her daughter. She worries over herself. When she first took in Hailey, there were days she wondered if the stress was too much and if she should send Hailey away. But now, the house feels devastatingly empty without her.
When Hailey was 11 weeks pregnant, she snuck Ash, the cat, into the house against Spradley’s wishes. At the time it infuriated Spradley, who was already having a difficult time feeding two humans and two dogs, making frequent trips to the food pantry. Then she saw how much comfort the cat brought Hailey as she faced an unknown future.
When Hailey was taken away, Spradley started letting the cat sleep beside her at night.
Over the years, Hailey ran from multiple family members and foster homes.
But she never ran from Spradley. It’s something Hailey’s social worker pointed out to Spradley in messages throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, and something Spradley continues to emphasize in her fight to bring Hailey and her daughter back under her roof.

It’s why Spradley wasn’t shocked when she learned at Hailey’s most recent placement hearing in mid-April that she had run away from the maternity home just hours earlier.
“I don’t believe what the system is doing to her… She is a child that’s been in that system for so long that they broke her,” Spradley said the next day, after police located Hailey and her daughter about 130 miles east, in south-central Illinois.
“Sometimes she makes me so mad,” Spradley continued, “but I just can’t blame her for what they did to her. I blame them. I blame the system.”
After Hailey and her daughter were located by the state, they were moved to another foster home, just outside St. Louis.
A few days later, Hailey said her case worker showed up with police, insisting her daughter was underweight and needed to be evaluated at the hospital. Spradley rushed to St. Louis Children’s Hospital to meet them. There, she said doctors gave the baby a clean bill of health and noted she gained weight since the week prior.
Then on Friday, hours after the Missouri Department of Social Services responded to a request for comment on Hailey’s case from The Independent, her case worker called Spradley. The state would soon allow Hailey and her daughter to return to Spradley’s care, at least until a court made a more permanent placement decision, Spradley said.
Despite the sudden good news, nothing about the family’s situation is set in stone.
“I’m scared about what tomorrow’s going to bring,” Spradley said Sunday.
She often reflects on words she spoke to Hailey’s mother not long before she died. Hailey was in a private foster home at the time.
“I promise you I’m going to bring Hailey home,” she said more than a decade ago.
It’s why Spradley didn’t hesitate when Hailey reached out for help. Though when asked about that decision, Hailey, who doesn’t tend toward sentimentality, said, “I knew she’d take my dumb ass.”
She flipped Spradley the bird. Spradley mirrored the motion.
“Me and Hailey, our relationship, even when she has hardships, I’m like, ‘I’m not letting you go,’” Spradley said. “I’m not giving up on you.”
It’s why Hailey chose Spradley to help raise her daughter.
She’s adamant her daughter won’t end up in the state’s care the way she did.
“What they’re doing is f**ked,” Hailey said of her lifetime spent in the foster system.
Spradley is ready to fight right there alongside her niece.
“We want her to experience an actual caring family and have support rather than toss you aside whenever they can’t handle you,” Spradley said. “If they can’t handle you at your worst, then they don’t deserve you at your best, right?”

WASHINGTON — Americans are increasingly unsure what to believe about measles as an outbreak spreads throughout the country, according to a survey released Wednesday by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.
The poll shows that nearly a quarter of those asked believe a commonly repeated false claim that getting a child vaccinated against measles could lead to autism. About the same percentage of those surveyed believe it’s either definitely or probably true that vitamin A can prevent someone from contracting measles, even though it cannot.
And 19% of those surveyed believed untrue statements that the vaccine for measles is more dangerous than contracting the virus.
Parents who believed at least one of the three incorrect claims were more likely to have delayed or skipped some vaccinations for their children. Nearly a quarter, 24%, of those surveyed said they haven’t protected their children via vaccination, more than double the 11% of parents who responded that all three of the false statements about measles were definitely or probably untrue.
 Ongoing outbreak

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that as of late last week there are more than 800 measles diagnoses throughout at least 25 states.
The infections are spread throughout different age groups with 31% of cases in children under five years old, 38% of diagnoses in those between five and 19 years old, 29% in people above the age of 20 and 2% in those with an unknown age, according to the CDC.
Eighty-five patients have been hospitalized and three have died. Nearly all of the confirmed cases, 96%, are in people who have not received the MMR vaccine or who are unsure about their vaccination status, according to the CDC.
States with confirmed cases include Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington.
Virginia reported its first case this year over the weekend, though that’s not yet included on the CDC’s website about the ongoing outbreak.
 Understanding linked with concern

KFF’s survey shows that even though there are many people who believe untrue claims about measles or the MMR vaccine — which protects against measles, mumps and rubella — there are higher percentages of people who understand basic facts about the virus and who are concerned about the ongoing outbreak.
Seventy-five percent of those polled said it was incorrect that the MMR vaccine leads to autism, 81% responded it was wrong to say the vaccine is more dangerous than contracting the virus and 75% said it was false that vitamin A can prevent someone from getting measles.
About half, or 51%, of those surveyed said they are at least somewhat concerned about the spread of measles. That worry was highest among Hispanic adults, 62%, and Black adults, 61%.
Most of the people surveyed, 56%, knew that the spread of measles was higher this year than during prior years, though that number varied among people of different political leanings.
Seventy-one percent of Democrats knew that diagnoses of measles have spiked in recent months, compared with 54% of independents and 49% of Republicans.
KFF conducted the survey of 1,380 adults between April 8 and April 15 via telephone and online questions.

Gun regulation has been one of the most hotly contested issues at the North Carolina General Assembly this year.
Lawmakers have introduced bills on a myriad of topics: constitutional carry, handguns at private schools and privacy around concealed carry permits, to name a few.
Permitless concealed carry — known as constitutional carry due to the idea that individuals have the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms without infringement — has drawn the most attention.
Senate Bill 50, Freedom to Carry NC, would allow individuals who are U.S. citizens, at least 18 years of age and not otherwise prohibited by law to carry concealed weapons without applying for a permit.
It’s backed by Republican leadership and would make North Carolina the 30th state to approve of constitutional carry. The bill has passed the Senate and awaits further approval in the House.
Its counterpart in the lower chamber, House Bill 5, or NC Constitutional Carry Act, is largely the same. This measure still needs approval from the House Rules Committee.
The biggest difference in the legislation is that HB 5 would authorize elected officials in the state to carry a concealed firearm “while performing their official duties if the official has a concealed handgun permit.” While the State Capitol and Executive Mansion are excluded from this list, it would be allowed at the State Legislative Building and Legislative Office Building, where lawmakers conduct their business.
States move to outlaw popular ‘Glock switches’ that make some guns fully automatic

North Carolina residents are overwhelmingly opposed to the measures, according to newly released polls. But lawmakers have chosen to move forward.
“There is political play around this policy that is lawmakers in both chambers pandering to the far right extremists and, frankly, being more worried about their own primaries … than they are about the safety of their constituents,” said Monisha Henley, senior vice president for government affairs at Everytown from Gun Safety. “That is why they’ve been trying to push it through the legislature at lightning speed.”
A 2022 study from the Crime Prevention Research Center looked at changes in crime and killings of police after adopting constitutional carry. Using data from 13 states, researchers found that the drop in murder is statistically significant, but the change in violent crime is not.
Paul Valone, president of the Grass Roots North Carolina gun rights group, has spent decades working on the issue. He’s modeled his advocacy after legislation in Vermont, the first state that didn’t have restrictions requiring permits for concealed carry.
“SB 50 and HB 5 are not perfect bills, but they’re what’s achievable right now,” Valone said. “Those of us who have spent a lot of time in the movement believe that because we lost our rights over generations incrementally, we will probably have to win them back incrementally.”
The movement has spread to schools. House Bill 193, Firearm Law Revisions, authorizes individuals with a valid concealed handgun permit to possess or carry a handgun on educational property owned, used, or operated by a private school.
The bill’s wording would allow anybody lawfully entitled to carry a concealed weapon to do so on the premises of a private school below the college level, with written permission from the school. This could be school officials, teachers, and even students.
“This bill endangers students, it endangers teachers, and people don’t want it,” Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) said during a committee hearing. “You’re telling the teachers of North Carolina that we don’t really care what you say.”
Coming up Tuesday, members of the House Judiciary 2 committee will discuss The Firearms Liberty Act. House Bill 674 would among other changes allow for the issuance of lifetime concealed handgun permits.
School districts promote secure storage
NC S.A.F.E. (Secure All Firearms Effectively), a statewide initiative to raise awareness on storing firearms safely, announced a partnership with the Wake County Public School System last Thursday. NC S.A.F.E for Schools is designed to help school districts across the state share resources about safe gun storage with parents in the district.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

The Wake County Board of Education unanimously passed a resolution in March of last year to “regularly and consistently” provide families with information and resources on the importance of secure gun storage.
North Carolina experienced at least 12 incidents of gunfire on school grounds in 2024, resulting in one death and nine injuries. Residents of Raleigh’s Hedingham neighborhood are still reeling from an October 2022 mass shooting in which a teenager who was able to access his father’s firearms killed five people and wounded two others. The teen charged in that shooting spree will go to trial in 2026.
Research has shown that secure firearm storage practices are associated with up to a 32% reduction in the risk of self-inflicted and unintentional firearm deaths.
“As a school system, we have resolved to educate our community on the importance of safe gun storage and its role in protecting students. Whether providing handouts for safety presentations, helpful information for digital communications, or even materials for school resource officers, resources from NC S.A.F.E. have been invaluable to that mission,” Robert Taylor, superintendent of the Wake County Public School System, said in a statement.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)I watched the April 8 Senate Finance Committee hearing on Rhode Island’s critically essential but chronically underfunded public transit system, which faces a $32.6 million budget deficit. Committee members hammered the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s (RIPTA) new CEO for the agency’s decision to delay a mandated efficiency study due back in March. As lawmakers hinted that the delay in conducting the study justified not providing additional funding for RIPTA, a thought circled my mind: Where is the efficiency study for the new Washington Bridge?
Public transit in Rhode Island has always been held to an unfair standard compared to other public services, especially highways. Nobody proposed doing a cost/benefit analysis before funding the new Washington Bridge despite it costing $713 million. Legislators may argue that the potential for financial savings is a good reason for withholding funding from RIPTA until the efficiency study finishes, but I can make a pretty good guess as to what the results will be. RIPTA has been studied for efficiency seven other times. 
The Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council did so in 2002. The Acadia Consulting Group did so in 2006. Consultants Abrams-Cherwony & Associates did so in 2007. The Special Legislative Commission to Study Transit Service in the State of Rhode Island did so in 2007. Then-Gov. Don Carcieri did so in 2008. The Senate Commission on Sustainable Transportation Funding did so in 2011. And finally, RIPTA gave a presentation to the Senate Oversight Committee in March 2023, which references findings by the American Bus Benchmarking Group of RIPTA “outperforming similar agencies across the country in almost every key performance indicator. Despite a chronic lack of funding, RIPTA provides more trips, across a larger area, at a more effective cost per trip than other transit agencies that serve similar population areas anywhere in America.” 
These reports didn’t find inefficiencies within RIPTA that would magically fix its fiscal cliff – rather, many highlighted the need to expand transit and praised RIPTA’s ability to run efficient, award-winning service despite chronic underfunding. Nearly all of these reports proposed many solutions to address the critical need for sustainable, long-term funding for RIPTA; yet two decades later, few of these solutions have ever materialized as RIPTA hobbles from one fiscal year to the next. 
At this point, it’s challenging to see how this eighth efficiency study is anything other than an attempt to avoid funding public transit and deprive Rhode Islanders of the economic growth, traffic reduction, and mobility justice that we deserve.
There is a reason we don’t ask public libraries, state parks, or highway builders to do efficiency studies before giving them money: Financial efficiency is at odds with serving the public effectively. RIPTA’s highest cost services are its rural routes, like the 10x that provides the only transit service to Foster and North Scituate. However, these “inefficient” rural routes are lifelines for the riders who use them and are often the only difference between financial stability and unemployment. RIPTA is a public service, not a business, and it can’t effectively serve the needs of all Rhode Islanders if it is forced to be efficient. There is a reason it’s not called the “Providence County Public Transit Authority.”










At this point, it’s challenging to see how this eighth efficiency study is anything other than an attempt to avoid funding public transit and deprive Rhode Islanders of the economic growth, traffic reduction, and mobility justice that we deserve.


There is no more couch change to find. RIPTA was forced to do more with less when federal funding cuts  plowed a $6M budget gap in 2014. Since 2010, RIPTA has slimmed and slimmed as its largest funding source has withered up, while RIDOT’s budget grew one and a half times as fast. Any belt-tightening left was erased in the financially destructive COVID pandemic, as RIPTA remained one of the only transit agencies in the nation that didn’t cut service.
We don’t need one more study to know that RIPTA is one of the most efficient transit systems in the nation, that 30,000 Rhode Islanders depend on it daily, and that hundreds to thousands would lose their jobs if service is cut. We don’t need one more study to know that the state’s highway system can’t handle even more cars on the road, and it will be impossible to meet our state’s Act on Climate mandates if RIPTA collapses. What we do need is for our state leaders to fund transit as the essential public service it is, to recognize how detrimental letting RIPTA collapse will be for household income, student outcomes, congestion, and the local economy. We don’t need an eighth efficiency study to understand that for tens of thousands of Rhode Islanders, the collapse of RIPTA is like the collapse of a second Washington Bridge.

The Delaware Prescription Opioid Settlement Distribution Commission (POSDC) has opened applications for its third round of grant funding, announcing approximately $13 million in available funds to support initiatives tackling the state’s ongoing opioid crisis.
The funding is aimed at empowering local organizations to launch or expand programs focused on addiction recovery, prevention, and support for those impacted by opioid use disorder.
The grants are part of Delaware’s broader effort to use opioid settlement dollars to address the public health emergency caused by the nationwide epidemic.
“This grant funding offers a critical opportunity to provide real help to individuals, families, and communities struggling with the devastating effects of opioid addiction,” said Joanna Champney, co-chair of the POSDC. “We are committed to supporting programs that promote healing through evidence-based solutions and measurable outcomes.”
Attorney General Kathy Jennings, who also serves as co-chair of the commission, emphasized the importance of using funds recovered from pharmaceutical companies to drive meaningful change.

“This work is close to my heart,” Jennings, co-chair of the POSDC, said. “We at the Department of Justice have been fighting tooth and nail, often punching above our weight, to hold Big Pharma accountable for the devastation they have caused in Delaware. And we have had some big wins, bringing back millions of precious dollars to fund treatment and abatement of the opioid crisis in our state.”
Grants from opioid settlement
Three types of grants are available:

Micro-Grants (up to $10,000): For rapid-response projects, particularly from smaller or community-based organizations.
Mini-Grants ($10,000–$30,000): For more structured projects targeting specific outcomes.
General Grants ($30,000 and up): For larger, long-term programs with established infrastructure and a proven track record.

“We are seeing some real progress with a staggering reduction in the epidemic’s death toll over the last year thanks to the many fantastic people and organizations, the commission included, dedicated to this vital work,” Jennings said. “Yet, there is still so much to be done. Now is the time to dig in and double down, and I trust that this round of grant funding will give us that edge to keep pushing forward.”
Applications opened on April 21. A series of informational webinars for prospective applicants will be held on April 28, May 5, and May 12. The application deadline is May 19.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.
Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Cigarette smoking has declined dramatically among adults and youth, state data shows. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Smoking has steadily declined in Alaska over the past decades, evidence that coordinated health campaigns mounted over several years have been effective, a new report from the state Department of Health said.
Adult cigarette smoking rates fell to 16% in 2023 from 28% in the 1990s, according to the Alaska Tobacco Prevention and Control Program’s annual report, released Wednesday. Among Alaska Native adults, who have long had higher rates of smoking use than the state average, the declines were notable: down to 29% in 2022 from 41% in 2013.
However, about one in four Alaska adults used tobacco or nicotine products in 2023, the report said. That rate has remained constant over several years.
Among Alaska youths, both cigarette smoking and the use of electronic cigarettes have declined, indicating that public health campaigns have been effective, the report said.
Youth smoking rates declined from 37% in the mid-1990s to 7% in 2023, the report said. A sharp decline coincided with the state’s decision in the 1990s to dramatically increase the tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products. The increase, in 1997 legislation, gave Alaska what was at the time the nation’s highest tobacco tax, and it was geared toward discouraging youth from taking up the habit.
Youth use of electronic cigarettes, products that are newer on the market, has also declined, from 26% in 2019 to 17% in 2023, the year with the most recent data from the Alaska Youth Risk Behavior Survey.
Christy Knight, manager of the Alaska Tobacco Prevention and Control Program, said the decline in use of e-cigarettes has come amid a coordinated education campaign within schools and elsewhere.
Still, the 17% rate “is still quite high,” Knight said. “We still have a lot of work to do, but we know that what we’re doing has brought it down and we can continue to bring that down with these comprehensive partnerships and approaches.”
The declines in Alaska tobacco use come amid big declines nationally, and Alaska’s tobacco-use rates remain higher than national averages.
Among adults nationally, cigarette smoking declined from 42.4% in 1965 to 11.6% in 2022, a 60-year low, according to the CDC. About 1 in 5 U.S. adults used tobacco products of any kind in 2022, according to the CDC.
Among youths nationally, use of tobacco products nationwide hit a 25-year low last year, according to the CDC. Only 1.4% of U.S. high school and middle school students reported last year that they regularly smoke cigarettes, and 5.9% reported regular use of e-cigarettes, according to the CDC.
Within Alaska, tobacco and nicotine users have demonstrated strong interest in quitting those habits, the state report said. Last year, 1,816 people made use of services provided through the Alaska Tobacco Quit Line, a free state program, the report said.

	But education and cessation efforts face some additional challenges in rural areas of the state, Knight said.
One is the relative lack of access to health care resources, she said. Primary health providers are key to inspiring people to quit tobacco, but rural residents may be missing that inspiration, she said.
“If somebody’s in a community where they don’t have access to that provider, that can impact whether or not they’re being advised to quit at the same rate as people who are in communities that do have easy access to a health care provider,” she said.
Disparities can result from other factors, such as poverty and discrimination that make it harder for people to know about or get services, or tobacco marketing campaigns that target certain population segments, she said.
In recent years, health organizations and tribal governments in rural areas have stepped up their tobacco prevention and cessation programs, the state report said.
Knight cited the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corp. tobacco control program as one example. That tribal health organization provided information that helped convince the Bethel City Council to expand its city tobacco tax to include nicotine-containing products like e-cigarettes, and it regularly refers patients for tobacco-cessation services, the report noted.
Taxes continue to be used as a tool around the nation to discourage smoking or vaping, but Alaska has no state tax on e-cigarette products.
For the third time, state lawmakers are working on legislation to impose taxes on those products.
One bill to do that was passed by the Legislature in 2022 but was vetoed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The sponsor, Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, introduced another version in 2023, but that bill failed to move forward after the House last year altered it and removed the e-cigarette tax provisions.
Now Stevens has introduced a new version, Senate Bill 24, that had reached the Senate Finance Committee as of late April. A House version, House Bill 49, is pending in that body’s Finance Committee.
Dunleavy has not decided yet whether to sign or veto a bill with an e-cigarette tax, said spokesperson Jeff Turner. “If and when it passes, and is transmitted to the governor’s office, he will review the bill and make a determination,” Turner said by email.
Alaska last raised its state tobacco tax in 2006. Several municipalities have their own taxes on tobacco and e-cigarette products.
While smoking and youth vaping have declined, Alaskans’ use of smokeless tobacco products has remained steady over several years, according to department statistics. From 2011 to 2023, that rate remained around 6%, according to the Alaska Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
Among Alaska smokeless tobacco users, nearly 16% used iqmik, a potent mixture of tobacco and fungus and plant ash that is traditionally used in parts of Western Alaska, according to state statistics. The use of iqmik was showed distinct patterns, according to the department’s data. Among Alaska Native adults who used smokeless tobacco products between 2021 and 2023, about a third used iqmik, Knight said. And among Southwest Alaska residents who used smokeless tobacco between 2021 and 2023, about two-thirds used iqmik, she said.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied. 


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Legislature poised to pass emergency bill to better prepare Maine for extreme weather

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

Two announcements last week were good news for South Carolina’s electric customers and instructive news for our legislators trying to pass an energy bill in the last few days of the session.
The focus of these announcements was on data centers and who pays for the new power plants and transmission lines they will need.
These data centers are large, windowless buildings packed with computers and related components to store massive amounts of data and do high-speed data analysis necessary for AI, artificial intelligence.
They consume huge amounts of electricity that earn them the name “energy hogs.”
Big tech needs these data centers to sell AI services to drive their profits.  Unlike other large industries they create few jobs.
According to our utility executives, data centers account for about 65% of the new energy generation needs of the state.
Private utilities, like Duke Energy and Dominion Energy, are more than willing to build new power plants to serve data centers since building things is the way these utilities really make their money, i.e. profits approved by the South Carolina Public Service Commission.
Typically, all utility customers pay for new power plants.
However, the growth of data centers across the country and the new power plants they will require have alarmed state officials nationally.
Other states are looking to protect residential and small business customers from paying higher electric bills driven by the energy needs of big tech data centers.
Last year, a Senate Special Committee on South Carolina’s Energy Future took testimony covering a wide range of issues including data centers.
The consensus of that committee was that consumers needed to be protected from the costs of building new power plants and other facilities mostly to serve new data centers.
As a result, the Senate amended an energy bill (H.3309) previously passed by the House to require data centers to pay their own way for their energy.  There would be no cost shifting to other consumers.
New data centers would pay for the new power plants and transmission they need with higher rates, a minimum billing requirement and a 15-year contract with the utility to guarantee that the data center would pay for the energy generation they said they needed even if they moved or reduced their energy use.
Other consumers would be protected.
The Senate also removed tax incentives for new data centers.  No longer would these data centers be exempt from paying sales tax on their computers and the electricity those computers use.
The Senate concluded that state taxpayer dollars should not be used as an incentive for data centers that produce few local jobs and little other economic benefit to the entire state.
That energy bill is now back in the hands of the House where some members are concerned that data centers would no longer be interested in investing in South Carolina and local governments could lose property tax opportunities.
So, now for last week’s surprising news.
A $2.8 billion computing center was announced in Spartanburg County, reportedly the second largest investment ever in South Carolina.
What makes this supercomputing operation important is that it will generate its own electricity from natural gas. This shows that requiring data centers to cover all costs associated with their energy needs is not a deal breaker.
They will still be very profitable.
The second announcement was that the Board of Santee Cooper, the state-owned utility, voted unanimously not to wait on the state Legislature.
The board voted to immediately adopt special rates, as proposed by the Senate, that would result in data centers not shifting any of their energy costs to other consumers. The board also included new large manufacturers in this policy.
With last week’s energy-related announcements as instructive, the House should accept the Senate’s and Santee Cooper’s lead on protecting other ratepayers from rate hikes due to the costs of providing electricity and transmission to new data centers.
Regarding state tax exemptions to lure data centers, the Senate position should be kept.
Taxpayer money should not be used to attract a data center that generates few employees in a local community but provides very little economic benefit to the rest of the state. Local governments can offer any sweetheart property tax deal they want, as was done for the Spartanburg County data center.
Data centers are coming to South Carolina and every state.  Do we need them here?
No.
But they are welcome as long as the rest of us don’t have to subsidize their profits with higher electric rates and state-tax incentives.

(Photo courtesy of Robin Tallon Jr.)More than three decades after leaving elected office, a former South Carolina congressman transferred $1.25 million from his campaign reserves into a Morgan Stanley account for charitable giving.
Robin Tallon Jr., who represented the 6th Congressional District for 10 years before not seeking re-election in 1992, moved the money last October as a “donation of securities,” according to the description on his last federal campaign filing. That’s not for personal investments, he told the SC Daily Gazette, but to a donor-advised fund to be distributed to charities.
The transfer was intended as the first step in officially shutting down the account, as the 78-year-old Florence resident thought he’d closed the door on attempting a return to politics. But as of Friday, he was rethinking that decision.
Despite not being in office since Bill Clinton’s 1993 inauguration, Tallon said he’s kept his campaign account open — and filed regularly with the Federal Election Commission — ever since, just in case he decided to make another run. In the meantime, he invested donations from decades ago, which is how he had that much money to transfer, he said.

  Former U.S. Rep. Robin Tallon speaks at a press conference on Wednesday, April 29, 1992. (Screenshot courtesy of C-Span.)

“I’ve been encouraged to run by constituents and other people to run over the years,” he told the SC Daily Gazette last week.
And he may yet try to return to Washington — this time as a senator.
He’s considering a 2026 bid to challenge U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham as an independent.
Tallon, a native of Dillon, represented the 6th District as a Democrat when it spanned the Grand Strand and entire Pee Dee region. After a federal court drastically redrew the district’s lines following the 1990 census to create a House seat with a majority Black population, Tallon decided not to seek re-election. Democrat Jim Clyburn has held the seat since.
While he left Congress, Tallon didn’t altogether leave Washington. He worked as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill for a quarter century. His clients included Atria, one of the largest producers of tobacco, and dentists.
Tallon no longer considers himself a Democrat. The party’s moved too far left, he told the Gazette.
But unlike many other former Democrats in South Carolina who switched parties, Tallon doesn’t consider himself a Republican either. He thinks South Carolina has become a “lap dog” for President Donald Trump, who he considers bad for the country. 
So, he’s considering running as an independent, knowing he can’t win that way. But he could “perhaps hold some of our elected officials’ feet to the fire,” he said Friday. 
“It’s almost why not,” he said of a potential bid using the remaining $96,500 left in his campaign account. He would not undo the transfer to Morgan Stanley, he said.
The transfer was part of his 2024 end-of-year report filed April 12, more than two months late. Tallon blamed that on his accountant, saying he didn’t even realize it was past due.
Outside of Tallon, there’s only one former South Carolina congressman with an open campaign account: Gov. Mark Sanford.
As of his last FEC filing, the former two-term governor and two-time 1st District representative had more than $1.3 million cash on hand in his congressional campaign account. He told the Gazette he’s keeping it open because he may seek office again.
Sanford last campaigned in 2019, in a short-lived challenge to Trump. He was ousted from his congressional seat in the 2018 GOP primary, which led to Democrat Joe Cunningham briefly turning the coastal district blue.
If Sanford does return to politics, it wouldn’t be his first comeback. He was widely expected to be done with politics when he left the Governor’s Mansion in January 2011 following a scandalous affair with a woman in Argentina. But two years later, voters sent him back to Congress in a special election to replace Tim Scott, after then-Gov. Nikki Haley appointed him to the U.S. Senate.

Sanford, who has long railed about out-of-control federal spending, had no details of his potential future bid.
“Time will tell,” he told the Gazette about his plans.
FEC requirements
Tallon initially told the Gazette his account would likely be emptied within six weeks. But, with a potential future bid, it will stay open indefinitely.
While certainly unusual, there’s nothing illegal about keeping an account open as long as Tallon, according to the FEC.
The federal agency recommends emptying and closing campaign accounts within six months of leaving office, according to a 2013 advisory opinion. However, there’s no required timeline, a spokesperson for the commission said in an email to the Gazette.
And if a former officeholder is considering a run, as Tallon claims he has been for the last three decades, there’s no requirement to zero out the account at all.
It’s illegal for officeholders to use campaign donations for personal expenses, even after they leave office.
Departing officeholders’ options include reimbursing their donors, donating to charities or giving money to other campaigns and PACs, as South Carolina’s other former congressmen have done.
Former 3rd District Rep. Jeff Duncan, who decided not to seek an eighth term last year, terminated his account in April. He gave the Jobs, Energy and Our Founding Fathers PAC that he sponsored more than $640,000 in the process.
Former 4th District Rep. Trey Gowdy left Congress in 2017 but didn’t close out his account until 2021. He listed a $905,000 donation to the Miriam Foundation, a faith-based organization that provides mentorship and support for young women, in his final FEC filing.
And former Rep. Henry Brown, who represented the coastal 1st District after Sanford left Congress the first time, drained his account slowly, officially closing it nine years after not seeking re-election in 2010. In that time, he made a number of donations to candidates ranging from mayoral races to President Donald Trump.
The donor-advised Morgan Stanley account that Tallon transferred his campaign money to allows him to decide which charities will get the money and when. Determining which organizations to donate has been difficult, he said.
Tallon, who previously served on the Medical University of South Carolina board, said some of the money will go to the hospital, although he doesn’t yet know how much.
Contemplating campaigns
It isn’t unusual for former officeholders to keep accounts open for years after leaving office, said Jordan Libowitz, an expert on campaign finance for the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.
Decades, however, is another matter. He’s never seen someone keep an account open as long as Tallon, he said.
“That money probably should have been disposed of years ago,” he said.
A 2018 investigation by the Tampa Bay Times and Tampa-based 10News WTSP, as well as numerous other TV stations, found 100 examples of so-called zombie campaigns. But Tallon stood out as showing “just how much former lawmakers can get away with,” the reporters wrote seven years ago.
Spending from his campaign account included a $20,000 payment to his son as campaign treasurer, $4,000 for a computer in 2007, and a $900 iPad in 2017, according to the report.
At the time, he defended keeping the account open while weighing a potential return to office but conceded it was unlikely.
“I need to give that money away at this point,” he said in January 2018.
But then he changed his mind. In July 2019, Tallon’s lawyer, Butch Bowers, told the FEC that he would not close the account.
“At this time, he has not decided to do so, but he may very well elect to run for office in the near future,” Bowers wrote.
Between the 2018 report and the Morgan Stanley transfer last fall, most of Tallon’s campaign spending went to charities, accounting fees and nearly $8,700 in legal expenses, which he said was used for finding out what his options were for closing the account.
Tallon said he’d contemplated running in multiple elections over the years, both in the House and Senate. He seriously considered challenging U.S. Rep. Tom Rice for the 7th District in 2022 but then decided against it. (Rice was ousted that year by former state Rep. Russell Fry.)
Earlier last week, he told the Gazette he’d decided he was officially done with politics. He planned to close out the account. But on Friday, he was contemplating a run to call out the problems with both major parties.
“This would be a very low budget campaign, but a chance to hold our leaders in Washington accountable,” he said.

Donavan McKinney says his residents have been severely impacted by power outages and poor energy reliability at an Aug. 10, 2023 event centered on climate and energy policy. | Kyle DavidsonState Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit) announced Monday that he would mount a challenge to U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) in the Democratic primary for Michigan’s 13th Congressional District.
McKinney, who noted that the 11th state House District he currently represents is one of the poorest in Michigan while the 13th Congressional District is among the poorest in the nation, said that he would bring working class representation to residents.
“I was born next to smokestacks. We moved 13 times as a kid. Sometimes it was an apartment, sometimes it was a family member’s house. Sometimes it was even our own car. But wherever it was, my mom and grandma made sure it felt like home. I spent my life trying to get back to help the place and people I love. I’ve never forgotten my roots, or the true purpose of why I serve; to always put the people first,” McKinney said in his campaign launch video, adding that Thanedar has “more in common with Donald Trump and Elon Musk than people like us.”

Thanedar, who spent $10 million of his own funds seeking the governor’s seat in 2018, served one term in the Michigan Legislature from 2021 through the end of 2022. He was elected to Congress for the first time that year, winning reelection in 2024.
“I bring the lived realities of the people of this district, lived realities that multimillionaires have no understanding of,” McKinney told the Michigan Advance ahead of his campaign’s launch. “I know our community’s struggles because I’ve lived them — and that’s why I understand just how urgent delivering monumental solutions to their monumental problems are.”
He said he would focus on economic security, environmental justice, education, public transportation, workers’ rights and more.
McKinney isn’t the first state lawmaker to launch a primary challenge against Thanedar. He joins a race that also features former state Sen. Adam Hollier (D-Detroit).
“I think the fact that there are multiple candidates in this race already just makes it crystal clear how fed up our community is with Shri, and how excited they are for representation that truly fights for us in Washington as hard as I have been fighting for us in Lansing,” McKinney said. “I’m running because our community has been calling me over and over to stand up and fight for them in DC, and they want a fresh, new voice leading the biggest, baddest coalition to deliver for this community and that’s exactly what we’re going to do.”
Thanedar has defended his constituent service record while in Congress, previously telling the Advance that since his election, his office has solved over 2,800 constituent cases, recovered nearly $3 million for constituents, received approval for $30 million in community projects, and sponsored and cosponsored 810 different bills. 
“We have world class constituent communication, including a record 11 in-person town halls,” Thanedar said.  SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Since the retirement of former U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Southfield) in 2022, neither of the two congressional districts that encompass Detroit have had a Black representative, an issue considered to be critical by leaders in the predominantly Black city. Both McKinney and Hollier are Black.
Detroit elected its first Black U.S. representative, Charles Diggs Jr., in 1954, and consistently elected a Black representative up until 2022, when voters elected Thanedar, who immigrated from India, alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), who is Palestinian American, to Michigan’s 12th Congressional District. 
When asked what resources he plans to bring to a race against Thanedar, who he called “Detroit’s own Elon Musk,” McKinney told the Advance he was supported by an “incredible coalition of elected officials, faith leaders, labor, community members, and more” and he was excited to grow that coalition between now and 2026.
“I’m not running because I’m a millionaire. I’m running because I’m not. I’m running because our community deserves to be able to sleep at night knowing they have a Representative in Congress who truly knows their struggles and truly fights for them every single day,” McKinney said.
McKinney’s campaign claimed the endorsement of a dozen Democratic state legislators on day one, including state Sens. Darrin Camilleri, Stephanie Chang, Veronica Klinefelt and Paul Wojno, and state Reps. Stephanie Young, Erin Byrnes, Kimberly Edwards, Alabas Farhat, Peter Herzberg, Tullio Liberati, Tonya Myers-Phillips and Veronica Paiz.
McKinney plans to hold an official campaign launch event Monday evening at SAY Detroit Play at the Lipke Community Center in Detroit.

In the aftermath of the deadly January Los Angeles County wildfires, Gov. Gavin Newsom traveled to L.A. and Washington, D.C. to lobby President Donald Trump and members of Congress for federal aid. 
But three months later, Congress has yet to move on Newsom’s $40 billion request, reports CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff. Meanwhile, frustrations from Democratic voters over Trump’s other policies put mounting pressure on the governor to push back — even though Newsom must still work with Trump to secure disaster relief.
Newsom met the president during a particularly tense time in their relationship: Trump had repeatedly threatened to withhold federal disaster aid; and the state Legislature wrapped up a special session, called by Newsom, to earmark funds for potential legal clashes against Trump’s administration.
After their meetings, Trump said an “L.A. fire fix” was coming, and Newsom — compared to his self-positioning last fall as an outspoken leader to the Trump resistance — didn’t hold any press events for most of late February. (Instead, he grabbed headlines while speaking with conservative firebrands on his new podcast.)
But in the months that followed, the Trump administration has attempted to enact tariffs that threaten California’s economy; proposed deep cuts to federal agencies and programs; and defied court orders regarding mass deportations — prompting Newsom to either file lawsuits or publicly speak out against the federal policies.
The governor has had a “tone shift,” said Bob Salladay, Newsom’s senior communications adviser, because “there has been a policy shift from D.C. that is beyond alarming.”
And what about that aid money? The Newsom administration is optimistic Congress will approve additional disaster aid by this summer. A bipartisan group, made up of all of California’s congressional delegation, is advocating for the relief package.
As for Newsom, he told reporters last week that he is continuing to work behind the scenes to maintain his relationship with Trump, but would still defend the state’s core principles.

Newsom: “If you want to make a point, you may want to reconsider. If you want to make a difference, stand tall and firm. And that’s kind of the approach.”

Covered California shared personal data


Illustration by Gabriel Hongsdusit, CalMatters




More than 2 million Californians are enrolled in Covered California, the state’s health insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act. Last year, some of these enrollees had their personal data shared with LinkedIn.
Recent forensic testing by CalMatters’ Tomas Apodaca and Colin Lecher revealed that Covered California’s website has been sending sensitive data to the for-profit job recruiting social networking site — and that visitors could have had their data tracked for more than a year.
As visitors filled out forms on Covered California’s website, trackers sent information to Linkedin. The information included whether visitors were blind, pregnant or used a high number of prescription medications. The trackers also monitored whether visitors said they were transgender or possible victims of domestic abuse.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Covered California confirmed that data was sent to LinkedIn as part of an advertising campaign that began in February 2024. Since CalMatters and The Markup’s reporting about the issue, however, most ad trackers have been removed from the site.

Should CA freight trains be shorter?

Today the Senate Transportation Committee is considering a bill that would shorten the length of freight trains in California. Proponents say the bill would make railways safer, but critics argue the measure could raise the price of goods in a state already struggling with a high cost-of-living.
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, the bill by Democratic Sen. Bob Archuleta of Norwalk would cap the maximum length of a freight train to 7,500 feet, or about 125 60-foot-long rail cars. The railway industry employs several thousand workers, including ones represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. The union argues that shorter trains are less likely to derail. The bill passed its first committee hearing last week after Democrats in the Senate’s committee on energy, utilities and communications voted to advance the measure.
The train industry and at least two dozen other business groups oppose the bill. They argue that shortening trains could make transporting goods more expensive since longer trains require fewer engines and crew members to pull. The proposal also may not be legal: The federal government wields broad authority over interstate commerce, enabling it to have final say on regulating railroads.

,California,2025-04-28 12:31:00+00:00,CalMatters,How the state sent Californians’ personal health data to LinkedIn,Tomas Apodaca and Colin Lecher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/04/covered-california-linkedin-tracker/,The state’s health insurance exchange transmitted pregnancy and domestic abuse data during a marketing campaign. It is reviewing its website practices.,"In summary
The state’s health insurance exchange transmitted pregnancy and domestic abuse data during a marketing campaign. It is reviewing its website practices.


The website that lets Californians shop for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, coveredca.com, has been sending sensitive data to LinkedIn, forensic testing by CalMatters has revealed. 
As visitors filled out forms on the website, trackers on the same pages told LinkedIn their answers to questions about whether they were blind, pregnant, or used a high number of prescription medications. The trackers also monitored whether the visitors said they were transgender or possible victims of domestic abuse. (See the data on our Github repo.)
Covered California, the organization that operates the website, removed the trackers as  CalMatters and The Markup reported this article. The organization said they were removed “due to a marketing agency transition” in early April. 
In a statement, Kelly Donohue, a spokesperson for the agency, confirmed that data was sent to LinkedIn as part of an advertising campaign. Since  being informed of the tracking, “all active advertising-related tags across our website have been turned off out of an abundance of caution, she added.” 
“Covered California has initiated a review of our websites and information security and privacy protocols to ensure that no analytics tools are impermissibly sharing sensitive consumer information,” Donohue said, adding that they would “share additional findings as they become available, taking any necessary steps to safeguard the security and privacy of consumer data.”
When an individual indicated they were pregnant, the information was sent to LinkedIn via the Insight Tag.
Visitors who filled out health information on the site may have had their data tracked for more than a year, according to Donohue, who said the LinkedIn campaign began in February 2024. 
CalMatters observed the trackers directly in February and March of this year. It confirmed most ad trackers, including the Meta “pixel” tracker, as well as all third-party cookies, have been removed from the site as of April 21. 
Since 2014, more than 50 million Americans have signed up for health insurance through state exchanges like Covered California. They were set up under the Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama 15 years ago. States can either operate their exchange websites in partnership with the federal government or independently, as California does. 
Covered California operates as an independent entity within the state government. Its board is appointed by the governor and Legislature. 
In March, Covered California announced that, after four years of increasing enrollment, a record of nearly 2 million people were covered by health insurance through the program. In all, the organization said, about one in six Californians were at one point enrolled through Covered California. Between 2014 and 2023, the uninsured rate fell from 17.2% to 6.4%, according to the organization, the largest drop of any state during that time period. This coincided with a series of eligibility expansions to Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for lower-income households.
Experts expressed alarm at the idea that those millions of people could have had sensitive health data sent to a private company without their knowledge or consent. Sara Geoghegan, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said it was “concerning and invasive” for a health insurance website to be sending data that was “wholly irrelevant” to the uses of a for-profit company like LinkedIn.
“It’s unfortunate,” she said, “because people don’t expect that their health information will be collected and used in this way.”
The LinkedIn Insight Tag
CalMatters and The Markup in recent months scanned for trackers on hundreds of California state and county government websites that offer services for undocumented immigrants using Blacklight, an automated tool developed by The Markup for auditing website trackers. 
“People don’t expect that their health information will be collected and used in this way.”Sara Geoghegan, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center
CalMatters found that Covered California had more than 60 trackers on its site. Out of more than 200 of the government sites, the average number of trackers on the sites was three. Covered California had dozens more than any other website we examined. 
On coveredca.com, trackers from well-known social media firms like Meta collected information on visitor page views, while lesser-known analytics and media campaign companies like email marketing company LiveIntent also followed users across the site. 
But by far the most sensitive information was transmitted to LinkedIn. 
While some of the data sent to LinkedIn was relatively innocuous, such as what pages were visited, Covered California also sent the company detailed information when visitors selected doctors to see if they were covered by a plan, including their specialization. The site also told LinkedIn if someone searched for a specific hospital.
When an individual selected a medical provider, the information was sent to LinkedIn via the Insight Tag.
In addition to demographic information including gender, the site also shared details with LinkedIn when visitors selected their ethnicity and marital status, and when they told coveredca.com how often they saw doctors for surgery or outpatient treatment. 
When an individual selected their ethnicity, the information was sent to LinkedIn via the Insight Tag.
LinkedIn, like other large social media firms, offers a way for websites to easily transmit data on their visitors through a tracking tool that the sites can place on their pages. In LinkedIn’s case, this tool is called the Insight Tag. By using the tag, businesses and other organizations can later target advertisements on LinkedIn to consumers that have already shown interest in their products or services. For an e-commerce site, a tracker on a page might be able to note when someone added a product to their cart, and the business can then send ads for that product to the same person on their social media feeds. 
A health care marketplace like Covered California might use the trackers to reach a group of people who might be interested in a reminder of a deadline for open health insurance enrollment, for example.
In its statement, Covered California noted the usefulness of these tools, saying the organization “leverages LinkedIn’s advertising platform tools to understand consumer behavior and deliver tailored messages to help them make informed decisions about their health care options.”
When an individual indicated they were a victim of domestic abuse or spousal abandonment, the information was sent to LinkedIn via the Insight Tag.
Trackers can also be valuable to the social media companies that offer them. In addition to driving ad sales, they provide an opportunity to gather information on visitors to websites other than their own.
On its informational page about the Insight Tag, LinkedIn places the burden on websites that employ the tag not to use it in risky situations. The tag “should not be installed on web pages that collect or contain Sensitive Data,” the page advises, including “pages offering specific health-related or financial services or products to consumers.”
LinkedIn spokesperson Brionna Ruff said in an emailed statement, “Our Ads Agreement and documentation expressly prohibit customers from installing the Insight Tag on web pages that collect or contain sensitive data, including pages offering health-related services.. We don’t allow advertisers to target ads based on sensitive data or categories.”
Legal recourse
Collection of sensitive information by social media trackers has in previous instances led to removal of the trackers, lawsuits, and scrutiny by state and federal lawmakers.
For example, after The Markup in 2022 revealed the Department of Education sent personal information to Facebook when students applied for college financial aid online, the department turned off the sharing, faced questions from two members of Congress, and was sued by two advocacy groups who sought more information about the sharing. Other stories in the same series about trackers, known as the Pixel Hunt, also led to changes and blowback, including a crackdown by the Federal Trade Commission on telehealth companies transmitting personal information to companies including Meta and Google without user consent and proposed class action lawsuits over information shared through trackers with drug stores, health providers, and tax prep companies.
LinkedIn is already facing multiple proposed class-action lawsuits related to the collection of medical information. In October, three new lawsuits in California courts alleged that LinkedIn violated users’ privacy by collecting information on medical appointment sites, including for a fertility clinic. 
Social media companies’ tracking practices have underpinned the tremendous growth of the tech industry, but few web users are aware of how far the tracking goes. “This absolutely contradicts the expectation of the average consumer,” Geoghegan said. 
In California, a law called the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act governs the privacy of medical information in the state. Under the act, consumers must give permission to some organizations before their medical information is disclosed to third parties. Companies have faced litigation under the law for using web tracking technologies, although those suits have not always been successful. 
Geoghegan said current protections like these don’t go far enough in helping consumers protect their sensitive data. 
“This is an exact example of why we need better protections,” she said of LinkedIn receiving the data. “This is sensitive health information that consumers expect to be protected and a lack of regulations is failing us.”

Police agencies — under scrutiny and worried about their own liability — increasingly won’t respond to someone in a mental health crisis unless that person is committing a crime. So who will transport people in psychosis to get help? And who will keep those around them safe? 


Susanna’s Sacramento County home bears the scars of her daughter’s mental illness. There is the lump on the wall near the entryway, patched after the girl, now 17, busted through the drywall. On a recent day, a double door in a bulky box awaited installation — to replace the splintered entry to the bedroom Susanna shares with her husband. 
The rages began when the girl was in fourth grade, said Susanna, whose last name CalMatters is withholding to protect her daughter’s identity. In recent years, the family has resorted to calling 911. Susanna said she has sustained a black eye and other minor injuries while fine-tuning her daughter’s medications, which include an antipsychotic. Mostly, she said, they’ve called in desperation for help when they had nowhere else to turn.  
“They have been able to assist, whether it be taking her to the hospital for a 5150 hold, or just de-escalating the situation,” said Susanna, using the Welfare and Institutions Code shorthand “5150” for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation, due to danger to self or others, or grave disability. 
Starting early last year, though, Susanna noticed that law enforcement “seemed more disinterested in those calls.” Then, as another crisis unfolded Feb. 7, the Sheriff’s Department made it clear they would not be coming out at all. 
The 911 audio and a summary log lay out the scene: Susanna’s husband was trying to sleep when the daughter, who was on probation, barged into the bedroom just before midnight, spit in his face, and “threatened to stab me and kill me.” A dispatcher asked if the daughter had “mental health issues;” the husband said she did.
What the couple didn’t realize: Due to a recent policy change, that detail kicked the call up to a supervisor — and ultimately left Susanna and her family to fend for themselves. 
Susanna said she saw her daughter heading back to the bedroom with a kitchen knife. She locked the door and was leaning against it to keep it from giving way under her daughter’s blows as her husband spoke to the dispatcher. The four-minute conversation ended when the dispatcher promised to “have someone out there.” 
Instead, a supervisor called the husband back. A call log states that they discussed the girl’s “extensive” mental health issues and history of assault as the screaming and pounding continued. The supervisor then suggested the couple stay in the locked bedroom. 
“No crime,” the call log concludes. Sacramento Sheriff’s Office “not responding.” 
Why a sheriff pulls deputies back on mental health calls
In early January, Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper met with county behavioral health and emergency medical response partners and dropped a bomb. His department would no longer respond to mental health crisis calls unless a crime had occurred, was in progress, or someone other than the person in crisis was deemed to be in imminent danger.
While he’d been pondering the pullback for a year, he told them, what pushed him to act was a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that he believes heightens his officers’ liability on non-criminal mental health calls.
“Law enforcement officers are not trained mental health professionals,” Cooper announced in a news conference a month later. “We wear the badge; we carry the gun. We deal with crime – not mental health crises.” When his department responds to calls that do involve crimes, he added, they will be treated as a “major event” — suggesting they might result in arrest rather than transport for care under the 5150 code. Cooper has called the change a “hard reset”  — one he knew would be controversial.

Yet these issues have challenged policymakers for more than half a century: Because mental illness isn’t a crime, when should law enforcement be involved, if at all? Who is best suited to safely de-escalate a mental health crisis and coax a person to accept care? And what if that person won’t — or due to the nature of their psychosis or substance use cannot — agree to go voluntarily? Who will transport them for involuntary psychiatric holds? 
Families of seriously ill loved ones say they’ve clamored for answers to that latter question for some time now. One desperate mother whose son recently needed to be taken to the hospital for urgent evaluation resorted to hiring a bounty hunter.
California under Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken bold steps  to broaden access to  care for people with untreated psychotic illnesses and substance use disorders— including expanding the legal definition of “grave disability” under the 5150 code. That law is expected to compel more people to receive treatment. Its success depends in part on transporting those in crisis for evaluations — even if they won’t go voluntarily. 
Just a week after Sacramento County implemented the new law, Sheriff Cooper informed his partners of his policy shift. Now, as he publicizes his position at a law enforcement conference and webinar and through his own podcast, some other agencies are following his lead. 
 Cooper cites his eight years in the state Assembly as instructive. There, he said in an interview, “We always heard, hey, we don’t want law enforcement responding to mental health calls. I come back as sheriff, and I’ve seen a lot of bad outcomes, in California and across the nation…Sometimes, introducing a badge and gun can really make it go sideways.”
Cooper was sworn in two months after a fatal deputy-involved shooting of a man in psychosis whose wife called for help as he threatened to hurt himself with a machete. He died 23 seconds after the lone deputy arrived. Last March, another such shooting took the life of a mentally ill man whose sister called 911 as he cut himself in the bathtub with a knife. Litigation is pending in both cases.

Susanna had seen Cooper’s announcement on TV. Three nights later, as she braced herself against the bedroom door, it didn’t cross her mind. Instead, she was shaken by the lack of response by law enforcement to what felt like a volatile and potentially dangerous situation.
“At that moment, you’re just thinking, ‘We need to get help here now, before this escalates further,’” she said. “Who is going to assist my family in these situations, and not only my family, but other families like mine, whose child might be more aggressive or might actually kill them or hurt them very badly? Who is going to step in and stop that before it’s too late?”
When medical workers want police to handle it
Like many jurisdictions, Sacramento County has been pushing to reduce the role of law enforcement in behavioral health crises and avoid traumatic hospitalizations — or arrests — when possible, instead helping people develop safety plans and plugging them into outpatient care. 
Still, county Behavioral Health Services Director Ryan Quist said law enforcement will always be critical to the “system level response.” His civilian crisis teams, made up of a clinician and a peer, cannot engage without backup in situations where people in crisis have weapons or are  particularly volatile — even if they are only threatening to harm themselves. And, he said, when clinicians determine an evaluation for a psychiatric hold under the 5150 code is necessary, they cannot detain or transport those too agitated or ill to consent to go. 
“Behavioral health doesn’t have that training skill set, or desire, to actually put hands on somebody and make them go somewhere,” said Quist. Beyond that, because they are not peace officers, “legally speaking, that’s assault.”
County leaders are scrambling to assess the damage. In emotional public testimony in February before the county’s Sheriff Community Review Commission — an advisory body that has no control over the elected official’s policies — Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District officials said Cooper’s department had denied 14 of their 21 requests from the field for backup over the previous 11 days.
“Put yourself in the shoes of the folks living next door. They were sound asleep at three in the morning….Their kids, their families could potentially have been in harm’s way.” Sacramento Fire Battalion Chief Parker Wilbourn
Each “presents a safety factor for the community that’s going to at some point either get somebody really hurt or killed,” Battalion Chief Parker Wilbourn told the commission, noting that close collaboration on such calls is the gold standard. “That’s why we heavily rely on our law enforcement brothers and sisters to have our backs like we have theirs.”
Dispatch records and incident reports shared in response to a CalMatters public records request show that, of those 14 cases, Metro Fire responders were able to get three people experiencing psychosis to agree to be taken to the hospital. In seven other cases, they were either unable to evaluate people in crisis due to safety concerns or unable to transport those who were uncooperative. 
Two calls involved a man wearing an ankle monitor and threatening his landlord’s son over an attempted eviction. Firefighters first came to the scene to evaluate the landlord for high blood pressure — and called for backup because the tenant’s threats, “confused speech, unsteady gait and erratic behavior” concerned them. “Situation becoming unstable,” the log notes. Yet a sheriff’s sergeant who waited nearby made it clear: “Won’t resp unless a crime occurs.”  
With no help on the way, the log continues, the landlord and two other residents “fled [the] scene” in fear.  Five hours later, the tenant  called 911 to say that he was bleeding from an injury, and planned to shoot himself and set the house on fire. Rancho Cordova Police, staffed by the Sheriff’s Department under a longstanding contract, declined to respond. Fire responders waited outside, checking for signs of smoke, but did not feel safe to  enter. 
“I want you to put yourself in the shoes of the folks living next door,” Wilbourn told the commission. “They were sound asleep at three in the morning when this was taking place. Their kids, their families could potentially have been in harm’s way.”
“Probably juvenile hall isn’t where she needs to be. She would be better off at a hospital, but (deputies) don’t take them anymore.”Susanna, whose daughter is facing charges of making terrorist threats
In Susanna’s case, neither her husband nor the Sheriff’s Department requested emergency medical personnel. Her daughter did calm down, eventually. Not long after the incident, she got off probation — something that would not have happened if she had been criminally charged for the spitting or threats that night. 
Sheriff Cooper has stressed that “being mentally ill should not be a crime. Someone shouldn’t have to be arrested and go to jail to get help.” But with no transport options for those who won’t or can’t consent to psychiatric evaluations that outcome can become inevitable.
Despite a follow-up with her psychiatrist, Susanna said, her daughter’s  mental health worsened, bringing deputies to the house three times earlier this month. All involved escalating disputes with a younger brother, the Sheriff’s Department confirmed. Once, a mail carrier dialed 911 as he heard yelling and furniture breaking. 
At the last call, on April 16, they took her into custody. Susanna had locked up the kitchen knives. But after assaulting her younger brother, she said, her daughter grabbed a fireplace poker and chased him with it, threatening to kill him. Her daughter is now in juvenile hall facing charges of making terrorist threats. 
“Probably juvenile hall isn’t where she needs to be,” said Susanna, who is pressing social workers to place her daughter in a treatment facility. “She would be better off at a hospital, but (deputies) don’t take them anymore. They no longer provide that service.”
On April 14, the Sheriff’s Department confirmed, a mail carrier dialed 911 when he heard Susanna’s daughter inside the home yelling and breaking items, including this door. Photo courtesy of Susanna 

An alternative to law enforcement is ideal, said Dominic Sisti, a bioethicist who directs the Scattergood Program for the Applied Ethics of Behavioral Health Care at the University of Pennsylvania. “But when you have somebody who is potentially violent towards themselves or others, I don’t see any way around having somebody there who has the training to manage that situation from a safety perspective, not just a health care perspective.” 
In the long term, he said, “these individuals are going to get sicker. They’re going to probably get more agitated. The families are going to suffer and we’re going to see worse outcomes.”
Among the most effective responses in volatile situations, experts say, are co-response teams, made up of a clinician who rides shotgun with law enforcement. In an interview, Sheriff Cooper described the two teams his department had been operating as “incredibly successful” — though they would not have been available at midnight, when Susanna’s family arguably needed them most. Now, given Cooper’s policy change, the behavioral health director has assigned those clinicians to other law enforcement agencies in Sacramento County. 
Cooper’s stance is nevertheless resonating with agencies who say they’ve been overly burdened with responsibility for the crisis of serious mental illness ever since California’s Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, which created the 5150 civil code, went into effect in 1969. All states now have similar laws.
“We’re not in the profession of white coats coming out to take somebody to the hospital,” said Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes, president of the California State Sheriffs Association. 
Barnes said he has long been committed to getting his department “out of social work.” Last year, his dispatchers began vetting non-criminal mental health calls, diverting 80 to other resources. Now, given his own heightened liability concerns, he’s taking it further. The 5150 code, he said, states that law enforcement “may” — not “shall” — initiate involuntary psychiatric holds, detain, and transport for evaluation those who appear to meet criteria. 
“We are going to be considering what is the best alternative approach,” Barnes said, “and some of that might be saying, ‘I’m sorry Mr. and Mrs. Jones, but you’re going have to deal with your son a new way.” 
The court ruling that set police on edge
The 9th Circuit ruling cited by Cooper, Scott v. Smith, resulted in the loss of “qualified immunity” for two Las Vegas police officers whose actions led to the death of an unarmed mentally ill man. The decision, which exposes the officers to personal liability, has without question troubled law enforcement. 
Roy Anthony Scott called Las Vegas police for help on the early morning of March 3, 2019, believing there were people inside his home plotting to harm him. The two responding officers persuaded him to come outside, where he obeyed commands and handed over two weapons. Bodycam footage reveals that Scott told the officers  he had schizophrenia, that he was too paranoid to turn around and face the wall. Twice, he asked, “Can you just put me in the car please?” 
When the officers grabbed Scott’s arms to restrain him on a mental health hold, court records show, he flailed and begged them to stop. Instead, they took him to the ground and placed him on his stomach. One applied bodyweight to Scott’s neck and chest “for about one to two minutes,” while the other held his legs. 
In keeping with U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the three-judge panel balanced the type and level of force used on Scott against the nature of his crime and threat he posed. Since Scott was mentally ill, not suspected of a crime, unarmed and posed no risk to officers or anyone else, “the government’s interest in applying force was limited,” they wrote, adding that any reasonable officer would have known that bodyweight compression to the neck and chest “created a serious risk of asphyxiating Scott.” 
Furthermore, they noted, the officers failed to attempt “less intrusive alternatives” such as “verbal de-escalation,” waiting for backup to execute a “safer ‘team takedown,’” or for emergency medical personnel “to execute a ‘soft restraint.’”
“Who would want to have a job where you’re doing what’s right, something happens, and you lose your house and everything you’ve ever earned?”Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper
Las Vegas police have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. 
Sheriff Cooper’s take is blunt: Any level of force on a non-criminal mental health call could lead an officer to ruin. “Someone doesn’t want to go, you’ve got to wrestle them on the ground, something happens, maybe they have a cardiac arrest. You lose qualified immunity,” he said. “Who would want to have a job where you’re doing what’s right, something happens, and you lose your house and everything you’ve ever earned?”
The law firm that provides legal advice to the California Police Chiefs Association and the California State Sheriffs Association disagrees. 
The court came to its conclusion by weighing all “facts and circumstances before it,” as they would in any Fourth Amendment excessive-force case, attorney James R. Touchstone of the firm Jones Mayer concluded in a Feb. 12 “client alert memorandum” addressed to “all Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police.” 
“Although many may disagree with the Court’s determination, including this author,” Touchstone wrote in the seven-page memo obtained by CalMatters, “it does not stand for the proposition that qualified immunity is unavailable to law enforcement officers” who are responding to non–criminal mental health calls and may need to be detained and transported to the hospital on an involuntary psychiatric hold.  
A commentary posted to Police1, a national online law enforcement resource, was more pointed. Given law enforcement’s longstanding role in psychiatric detention and transport, ample training opportunities, and best practices based on partnerships with clinicians and emergency medical responders, Cooper’s policy change, it states, “while well-intentioned, is simply wrong.” 
Desperate enough to hire a bounty hunter 
Patricia Wentzel, who serves on Sacramento County’s mental health board, has blasted Cooper’s stance as discriminatory, given that law enforcement responds to other non-criminal crises involving people with dementia or developmental disabilities. “I don’t think he feels a responsibility to this group of people,” she said. “That’s the impression conveyed by this decision.” 
Yet across the state, parents with severely mentally ill loved ones living at home aren’t exactly surprised. Katy Polony, a family advocate on an Alameda County mobile crisis team, said criminalization has often been the only option. 
“’Get a restraining order. Then we will forcibly go in. We’ll get that person out of there, and we’ll put them on the street,’” Polony said. “That’s what families have been told to do, forced to do.” 
Indeed, Susanna and her husband say that was the sheriff supervisor’s final suggestion to them on Feb. 7 before he hung up — that if they feared the daughter they should get a restraining order when she turns 18. 
While restraining orders are civil, violating them is a crime. 
“’Get a restraining order. Then we will forcibly go in’…That’s what families have been told to do, forced to do.” Katy Polony, a family advocate on an Alameda County mobile crisis team
Last year, Polony helped organize a group of parents from Fremont to press police to engage more on behavioral health crisis calls. After Cooper went public with his policy, she began hosting bimonthly Zoom calls to gather family input statewide. That’s where Mary Palafox first shared her story. 
For the past 14 years, Palafox has served as private conservator to her son, deemed gravely disabled by schizophrenia that took hold in his early 20s. Many parents don’t want the responsibility, or can’t afford to take it on. But Palafox has means. Her son, an artist who loves animals, thrives at the family’s Orange County home when he is stable. 
As her son’s conservator, Palafox has a standing court order to have her son evaluated at a hospital when she sees fit. When he has been too ill to consent to go voluntarily, law enforcement has helped coerce him onto an ambulance gurney. Until recently. 
Five years had passed since her son’s last hospitalization, but after stopping his medication, he retreated deep into his illness, she said. In early January, Palafox said, his doctor urged her to get him to the emergency room. Each serious bout of psychosis causes damage to the brain that can lead to neurocognitive deficits. As a nurse and longtime mental health advocate and educator, Palafox knew “it was a medical emergency.”

But, despite her legal paperwork, two law enforcement agencies declined to touch her son. Palafox first called 911 as he sat in florid psychosis in a Tustin restaurant. When he emerged, Tustin police officers “watched him walk away. They said that they cannot engage with him unless he’s committing a crime,” she said, “that they no longer help transport or ‘lay hands’ on anybody who has a mental illness.”
Palafox tried again a few days later as her son hid in a backyard shed at home, in psychosis. The Orange County Sheriff’s Department serves her unincorporated neighborhood, and deputies arrived along with a fire truck and ambulance, just as they had five years earlier. This time, she said, they told her they would not go into the backyard to evaluate her son for fear of escalation. They would only take him to the hospital if he climbed onto the gurney himself. 
“It would have had to be completely self-directed, and he was too symptomatic to understand that he needed to go,” Palafox said. “If he was capable of doing that, I would have taken him in my own car!”
Desperate, Palafox reached for her phone. “You just need a big guy to come in and help you,” mused one attorney who handles county conservatorships but had never heard of such law enforcement refusals for conservatees. Her second call, to a friend who runs a nonprofit for crime survivors, turned up a name. The man’s line of work: “Fugitive recovery.” 
The first image that popped into Palafox’s head was “Dog the Bounty Hunter,” the longhaired reality TV phenom. But the man who took her next call was professional and thorough. He reviewed her legal paperwork, and informed the sheriff’s department and UCI Medical Center security of his plans. When he showed up at Palafox’s place with a partner a few hours later, they went straight to the shed, where her son was still huddled. 
“He was kind of hanging on to things, not wanting to leave the shed,” said Palafox, who commended the men for their kindness, “but then they just picked him up.” With the aid of soft restraints, they “took him and put him in their truck.”
Palafox followed, informing the mental health liaison at the emergency room of their progress as she drove. They were directed to the ambulance bay – and, to the amazement of hospital staff who gathered to witness the unprecedented delivery, it was done. Palafox said her son was so ill he remained hospitalized for three months. 
Palafox paid $1,700 for the intervention, a fee she knows many families can’t afford. Neither do most have standing court orders to have their loved ones evaluated. But they share a problem.

“I’m not certain if that gap needs to be filled by our police and by our sheriff’s department,” she said. “I understand their scope of practice is people committing crime. It’s just that the transport need is still there.” 
When asked about Palafox’s experience, Orange County Sheriff Barnes returned to the distinction in the 5150 code — “may” versus “shall.” Just because she has a standing court order, he said “it does not by default mean we have to provide services. We are going to be taking a different review of our obligation to intervene — and in many cases there isn’t any.” 
The Del Norte County Sheriff and Crescent City Police Department have embraced more sweeping policies similar to Cooper’s, telling local media they will no longer respond to non-criminal mental health crisis calls. Barnes said he’s certain others will follow. 
Dial 911: Breaking “the habit that people got into”
There is little disagreement on the need to minimize the role of law enforcement in mental health crises. Alternatives that center dignity, self-directed care and lasting therapeutic relationships, while not widespread, are more available than ever. 
“The police were on the front lines for decades. And then the jails and the prisons were on the front lines. And now, in the last five years or so, we’re trying to move away from that,” said Yolo County Superior Court Judge Samuel McAdam, who teaches a course at UC Davis Law School on “mental health and the courts” that dives deep into the evolution of crisis response. “We’re trying to create a transformation in our society where everyone is taking responsibility, and the police are there for narrow important cases.” 
In many ways, Sacramento County is well-positioned to deliver. It was among the first in California to operate a  988 suicide and crisis lifeline — created by Congress in 2020 to reduce reliance on police. Cooper’s policy shift has now fast-tracked efforts to integrate 911 and 988 technologies, so dispatchers can make a smooth handoff and track that data. 
Last month, 988 counselors fielded 1,826 calls countywide, resolving more than 90% by phone, according to a spokesperson for WellSpace Health, which runs the service. In 16 cases, counselors determined there was an immediate threat to life so called out law enforcement or fire responders. They referred 154 calls to Sacramento County’s in-person “Community Wellness Response Teams.” Made up of a behavioral clinician and a peer with lived experience, they operate 24/7.
Due to critical Medi-Cal funding secured by California two years ago, similar teams are scaling up across the state. 
Meanwhile, two specialized teams run by the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, which pair a nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant with a paramedic, have been ramping up service to people in behavioral health distress. And, though Cooper’s teams have been sidelined, Sacramento County social workers have been riding shotgun with a handful of police departments on those “co-response” teams.

Kaino Hopper is a mental health advocate and mother of a severely ill adult daughter, has helped develop the civilian crisis teams. She said she was appalled by the unilateral nature of Sheriff Cooper’s decision. Like others, she believes close collaboration among law enforcement, behavioral health and fire responders must be restored. Yet for “families like mine,” she told the Sheriff Review Commission in March, there’s a silver lining. 
“We’re not entirely disappointed. Why? Because it’s made people need to know who we are and what we are,” Hopper said of 988 and the all-hours crisis teams. “We’re getting the flyers out there, grassroots, one-on-one,” at Sacramento Kings games, concerts and other public gatherings.
Dialing 911 for every mental health crisis “was the habit people got into,” Hopper told the commission. Now, she said, “our response teams are able to do 90% of the de-escalation necessary. Families are happy, support people are happy, even the person in distress is happy to have a non-uniformed person come out with an open-ended time frame.” 
McAdam, the Yolo County Superior Court judge, said these types of innovations should reduce the number of calls on which police are asked to assist. But they’ll always be involved when serious crimes occur. They should also be counted on to respond when civilian partners believe they can’t safely handle a situation, or need help to safely evaluate and transport on 5150 holds. That’s why training is critical. 
Tag team tactics “when things are chaotic”
A 2015 state law mandates some crisis intervention training for law enforcement, to help them understand and identify mental illness and best communicate with those in crisis. A Sacramento County Sheriff’s spokesperson said the department is in compliance and then some. Others have taken their training much further.
San Francisco Police Lt. Donald Anderson instructs outside agencies across the country on tactics that reduce risk and liability. As the head of his department’s Crisis Intervention Team, he coordinates with emergency medical responders and public health social workers to triage cases of people in distress, among them those who generate multiple 911 calls per week or day. “Then we can work with one another to see what else can we offer to get them to the resources they need,” Anderson said in an interview. “We tag team it.”

More than three-fourths of the department’s patrol officers have received 40 hours of voluntary crisis training, co-taught by clinicians and mental health advocates, with input from peers. But the game changer, a change in field practices that drove use of force on crisis calls down by 68% over a four-year period, was a different type of training — a mandatory one that Anderson helped craft.
Anderson is stocky with an enthusiastic teaching style and a passion for jiu jitsu. A prominent tattoo on his forearm honors the traditional Japanese code of ethics and conduct followed by samurai warriors. On a recent early morning with fog settled on the city’s hilltop police academy, he welcomed a group of officers to his 10-hour class. For years, he told them, those who’d sought out voluntary trainings wound up on crisis calls with partners who hadn’t. That was a problem. Behind it was a bigger one:  “We weren’t talking about the actual tactics of law enforcement.”
“When things are chaotic and you have an individual running around in the middle of downtown, maybe with a knife, shouting and screaming, and you’re trying to control the public and trying to engage with this individual, tactically how does that look?” Anderson asked his students.
“Slow everything down and start evaluating the situation. ‘What’s the crime? Is there a crime'”? San Francisco Police Lt. Donald Anderson
In 2016, Anderson and his then-supervisor traveled to Seattle to learn about that city’s “team approach” — and modeled their new training accordingly. Unless violence is imminent, teams assemble at the scene, each member with a defined role. 
Containing the person in crisis is the critical first goal. It allows for distance, Anderson told the class, and containment plus distance buys time. “Slow everything down and start evaluating the situation,” he said. “What’s the crime? Is there a crime? Because, if there’s no crime, we have to ask, ‘what are we trying to accomplish here?”
The scope of allowable force, he told the class, is “very narrow,” so “you have to be very, very smart about what options you are going to use.” 
Liability is always a concern. But case law offers a road map to navigate risk. Anderson did discuss Scott v. Smith with his class. Yet when it comes to people experiencing a medical or psychiatric crises who have not committed crimes, aren’t resisting arrest and don’t pose direct threats to law enforcement, his department draws guidance from another ruling.

In 2017, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court decision to strip a Michigan sheriff’s deputy of qualified immunity. Instead it established a novel three-factor test to guide response: If the person’s emergency poses an immediate threat of harm to themselves or others, and “some degree of force” is reasonably necessary to get them needed care, there is no loss of qualified immunity – unless the force applied is excessive. 
While the decision is not binding outside the 6th Circuit, legal advisors have encouraged law enforcement nationwide to consider it.
To ensure minimal use of force, officers often must collaborate with emergency medical responders to plan the least traumatic way to get a person onto an ambulance gurney. And sometimes, Anderson said, the best option “is to walk away” and follow up later. 
A policy authored by Anderson also lays out a protocol to disengage from a barricaded and potentially armed person who is threatening only themselves. It requires that other options be exhausted and calls for police to notify the Crisis Intervention Team, so that Anderson’s team can plan a visit, he said, “and get them the resources they need.” 
A new push to change California law on mental health crises response
Back in Sacramento County, behavioral health and Metro Fire officials say they have begun talks with Sheriff Cooper’s department to map out a path forward. The review commission has empaneled a committee to examine the legal interpretations of Scott v. Smith, Cooper’s rollout of the policy, and the protocols regarding when his department will and won’t respond. 
The committee has also been digging into the February incident involving Susanna’s daughter. She had called into the commission meeting 11 days later, to describe her horror at the lack of response, given her daughter’s threats and the knife Susanna saw in her hand. But there is a dispute. In an interview, Susanna’s husband said he’s “pretty sure I said she went and grabbed a knife.” 
He said he was adamant about wanting to press charges. But, he said, the supervisor told him,“‘We don’t step in on mental calls.’ I said, ‘Well it’s assault.’ And he said she has to actually hit you guys for it to be assault.” 
While his 911 call to the dispatch center was recorded, the supervisor’s follow up calls were not. But the summary log of the incident, which the Sheriff’s Department provided to CalMatters, paints a different picture. “Not holding any knives or potential weapons,” it states. The husband, it concludes, “stated he does not wish to pursue charges.” 
“There’s no accountability. They can say the sky was green and we have to go with it.”Susanna, who wants supervisors’ calls on mental health crisis to be recorded
Susanna’s first idea for reform: that those calls from supervisors, who according to policy make the final decision on whether to respond to mental health crisis calls, be recorded. 
“There’s no accountability,” she said. “They can say the sky was green and we have to go with it.”
A sheriff’s spokesperson would only say that the family is no doubt “going through a lot.” He confirmed that calls made from outside the dispatch center are not recorded, but said it’s a practice they may explore down the road.  
Meanwhile, family advocates of those with serious mental illness, among them Polony, Hopper and Wentzel, have been meeting with state legislators to craft a potential bill that would allay law enforcement liability concerns and enable clinicians to more easily call for involuntary 5150 holds. A similar bill failed to advance last year. 
For his part, Sheriff Cooper described the policy as a “work in progress. 
“We’re open minded. We’re not totally entrenched,” he said. “At the end of the day, I want everybody to go home safe. I don’t want to ever have to take someone’s life or have one of my deputies do that. That’s the most important outcome for everybody. And it’s tough. It’s not the same old business as usual, and people are having a hard time swallowing it.”

Private developers are working with the Massachusetts Port Authority on a proposal to expand Hanscom’s private jet capacity with 17 new hangars, the accompanying fuel tanks, and other infrastructure. A coalition of neighbors and environmentalists had been working since at least 2023 to oppose the plan with petitions, meetings with representatives, and yard[...]","YOU MAY WONDER how a peaceful well-behaved middle-aged academic found himself handcuffed and arrested along with 20 others last year at Hanscom Airfield.  Hanscom sits about 20 miles northwest of Boston in Bedford, on 1,300 acres along the town’s borders with Concord, Lexington, and Lincoln. It abuts the 3,700-acre Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge and is New England’s largest general aviation airfield for private jets, flying lessons, and the like.  Across a quiet country road from the airfield sits the birthplace of Henry David Thoreau. It seems an unlikely place for a ruckus.  Yet, quite a loud fight is brewing there. Private developers are working with the Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort) on a proposal to expand Hanscom’s private jet capacity with 17 new hangars, the accompanying fuel tanks, and other infrastructure. A coalition of neighbors and environmentalists had been working since at least 2023 to oppose the plan with petitions, meetings with representatives, and yard signs, without success.  In April 2024, about 20 of us went to Hanscom Airfield, held signs, sang songs, and gave speeches explaining our purpose, first at three private jet companies and then, after we were arrested, while sitting on the roadside curb in handcuffs. The Hanscom expansion would reverse one important element of Massachusetts’s famously progressive environmental policy. Massachusetts rightly gets credit for making partial progress on the first two out of three well-known fundamental principles for a climate-friendly energy system, which I teach in my class on climate change in the Environmental Studies program at Tufts University: (1) electrify everything that can be electrified, (2) make the electric grid green, and (3) reduce demand in a few difficult-to-electrify sectors such as aviation. State law has a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, which requires a rapid reduction and eventually a nearly complete stop in burning the fossil fuels that generate climate-damaging greenhouse gas pollution. To meet this goal, Massachusetts invests in electricity from green solar and wind power, and in new electric heat pumps to replace fossil fuel systems for residences and businesses, and more. When the Commonwealth boasted of meeting its interim 2020 goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (25 percent below 1990 levels), 95 percent of the progress came just from the electric power and building sectors. Sadly, the expansion at Hanscom would undermine the third principle about reducing demand in difficult-to-electrify sectors such as aviation. The success in meeting the 2020 goal was 5 years ago. Meeting the Commonwealth’s next interim goal for 2030 (50 percent below 1990) will require progress in more sectors than just electricity and buildings. Converting to green electricity is challenging for transportation and effectively impossible for aviation. Jet fuel provides 20 to 50 times as much energy per pound as even the most advanced electric batteries, which remain too heavy to power full-sized airplanes. And the so-called sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) each have flaws. Some SAFs come from biofuels that compete with food production, contributing to food price inflation and world hunger. Other more advanced SAFs are expensive enough that adopting them would still require less flying overall. As an alternative to technological fantasies of battery-powered flight, reducing demand in the difficult-to-electrify aviation sector would be more feasible than many people realize. For example, in higher education, which is a major industry in Massachusetts, I am the co-organizer of an initiative encouraging universities to set goals and measure progress for reducing flying, as part of their annual environmental reporting. During the COVID pandemic, universities temporarily made excellent progress using remote communication technologies. As an experimental proof of concept, I stopped flying myself in 2014 and was delighted to discover new ways of traveling overland for work and for recreation. Zero is not the right amount of flying for everybody, but this experiment illustrates the potential for ambitious reductions proportional to the seriousness of the climate challenge. Far from helping, Massachusetts authorities actively make aviation pollution worse. For Logan International Airport in Boston, the largest airport in New England, MassPort is expanding infrastructure and underreporting greenhouse gas emissions. In Logan’s Environmental Status and Planning Report, the table on greenhouse gas pollution counts only jet fuel burned during takeoffs and landings, a small fraction of the total. An appendix to the same document reports the true amount of fossil jet fuel sold at Logan, 443 million gallons in 2022, which is enough to generate 4.26 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, more than 6 percent of all Massachusetts greenhouse gases. And that’s just the jet fuel. It doesn’t count the emissions from ground operations, manufacturing the airplanes, and the “radiative forcing” effect, which further enhances the climate damage. As a fraction of the state total, aviation emissions from Logan have recovered from their Covid-era slump and now are setting new records. In this context, it would be absurd for Massachusetts to double the capacity at Hanscom Airfield specifically for private planes serving a plutocratic elite. Greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile are much higher for private jets than for commercial airlines, which are much higher in turn than for buses or electric trains. After the new infrastructure is built, private jets from Hanscom would produce enough greenhouse gas pollution to undo the benefit from 70% of the solar panels installed in Massachusetts. The project’s environmental impact statement failed to report the full extent of its greenhouse gas pollution and invented without evidence large purported savings from reduced “ferry” flights of empty private jets between nearby airports. The report was so fundamentally flawed that it was rejected by state officials and sent back for a complete resubmission. You can see why 20 friends and I felt obliged to object to expanding private jets at Hanscom Airfield. If there had been any alternative to public protest, I would have used it. I am a scholar, not a fighter. Before speaking up at Hanscom Airfield, I had never been arrested in my life. Now, at great expense in time and money, Massachusetts has scheduled individual trials in Concord District Court beginning May 13 and running through the summer. My own trial is scheduled for May 27.  So we have come to the point of decision. In this time of national crisis, will the Commonwealth of Massachusetts stand up for climate justice and meet its next interim climate goal for 2030? Or will it accelerate aviation pollution, understate the emissions, obey the billionaires, and prosecute the 21 good citizens who raised their voice and said, “This is wrong”? Parke Wilde is a professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. He will be on trial in Concord District Court May 27, on charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct related to a peaceful protest against the proposed expansion of private jet infrastructure at Hanscom Airfield in Eastern Massachusetts.The post Why We Were in Handcuffs at Hanscom Airfield appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hanscom-protest.webp?fit=1024%2C752&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 09:08:44.284178

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)This Chesapeake Bay wetland could be an environmental crystal ball.
With infrared lamps pointed down at marsh grasses — and heating cables placed beneath them — the environment is 5.1 degrees Celsius hotter than the surrounding area, simulating a future world warmed by climate change.
In nearby sections of marsh, carbon dioxide is pumped into structures that look like mini, open-air greenhouses.
“You’re never going to get a warmer world without also having higher CO2 in the atmosphere,” said Genevieve Noyce, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, which runs the wetland site.
The wetland is just a few miles from the Research Center’s headquarters in Edgewater, nestled in a crook of the Rhode River. And it has become a hotbed — pun intended — for several experiments that mimic global warming.
The latest research to emerge from the Global Change Research Wetland, or GCREW, was published last week in Science Advances, a peer-reviewed journal. That study captured data for five years, focused not on the wetland’s growth, but on its emissions.

But one of the experiments here has been ongoing since 1987, leading the center to pronounce that it’s likely the world’s longest-running field experiment simulating carbon dioxide elevation.
The researchers found that adding carbon dioxide stimulated the wetland’s growth by about 30% — and allowed its long grasses to start growing earlier in the springtime and stay green farther into the fall. Some years, the grasses can make it until December before they turn entirely brown, said Andrew Peresta, the site’s operations manager.
But nearly 40 years after the experiment’s beginning, Mother Nature is playing scientist, and adding new conditions to the simulation, Peresta said. Rising water levels, a handful of millimeters each year, have begun to change the story, slowing the rate of increased grass growth.
“All of these plants are adapted to grow with their roots in wet soil. But if it’s too wet — if the sea level comes up too fast — and they can’t keep up, then they start struggling,” Noyce said.
The study’s long time horizon has allowed scientists to document the marsh’s changes over time, including incursions by invasive phragmites, Peresta said.
“A lot of projects are only two to three years long,” Peresta said. “You might not learn as much as you do with this.”
Collectively, coastal wetland environments are among the world’s greatest carbon sinks. According to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration webpage, they annually trap carbon at a rate 10 times greater than mature tropical forests, preventing the harmful gases from reaching the atmosphere, where they contribute to warming.
But wetlands also release methane, a greenhouse gas that is about 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
  The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center’s experimental wetland includes plenty of heating lamps, and pods where carbon dioxide is also added to simulate the effects of climate change. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)
Traditionally, wetlands have been considered minor producers of the gas. But the Smithsonian researchers have discovered that raising the temperature of the wetland, with the submerged heaters and overhead lamps, speeds up methane production by about four times, compared to the undisturbed wetlands close by, Noyce said.
The same was true when researchers added carbon dioxide to the equation, except the increase was less dramatic — about 1.5 times. In other words, if climate change gets worse, it could tip off a domino effect in the wetlands, yielding more emissions that further worsen global warming.
“We knew there was something with adding elevated CO2 to reduce the amount of methane coming out of the plots. But we didn’t really know why,” Noyce said.
So the researchers looked to the microbial community in the soil beneath the wetland. There, some microbes produce methane, but others consume it.
Climate change seems to change the fine balance between these two types of microbes, increasing the methane that is released, said Jaehyun Lee, who was the study’s lead author as a post-doctoral researcher at the Smithsonian Center.
When carbon dioxide was added to the plots, it stimulated root growth, increasing the amount of oxygen in the soil. This gave more fuel to the microbes that consume methane by oxidizing it, Lee said. Their activity canceled out some of the effect from hotter temperatures, which spurred the methane-producing microbes, causing methane emissions to spike.
Even with the increased methane emissions, it seems likely that wetlands will still store more globe-warming emissions than they release, Lee said. But the research proves that the balance is delicate, and could potentially flip in the other direction, said Lee, who is now a senior researcher at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea.

Since 2016, experiments in Noyce’s section of the wetland, known as SMARTX, or the Salt Marsh Accretion Response to Temperature Experiment, have been funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. It remains unclear whether the funding will be impacted by recent Trump administration cuts to scientific research, particularly that which focuses on climate change.
The wetland receives three years of funding at a time, and is currently in its last year of the cycle, Noyce said. The team just applied for another three years, she said.
The 1987 project is funded by a National Science Foundation grant for long-term research in environmental biology, she said.
The new data could help improve the accuracy of climate change modeling, as researchers attempt to predict the amount of globe-warming gases that will be emitted, Lee said.
“When we set the the goal for carbon reduction in the future, to slow down the temperature rise, we also have to consider these types of changes in methane emissions,” Lee said. Otherwise, governments could struggle to reach their carbon reduction goals, he said.
The findings, released Wednesday, could also inform wetland plantings and restoration efforts, Noyce said.
“If you can start understanding which plant communities are going to respond in different ways under global change, then you can say: ‘Oh, maybe this plant community is going to be better. It might reduce the amount of methane coming out of this sort of ecosystem,’” Noyce said.

Just like that, Huertero and her adult son — whose medical issues prevent him from working — had to find a new place to live. She said she ended up homeless for the next six months, temporarily bunking with her daughter in Tooele. Also having been a domestic violence victim, she said she turned to South Valley Services for assistance, which eventually helped her obtain an Emergency Housing Voucher for rental assistance.

The Emergency Housing Voucher program, launched in 2021 by then-President Joe Biden as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, used $5 billion in federal funds to help house vulnerable people — those who are homeless, at risk of homelessness, or are trying to flee domestic violence or other dangerous situations, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
Since then, Huertero said that voucher has helped keep a roof over her and her family’s head. Currently, she lives on a multiplex in Salt Lake City with her elderly aunt and her adult son, both of whom rely on her as a caretaker. She works at a local housing authority — where she helps people like herself get housing assistance, trying to “give back” in as many ways as she can.
But without the voucher, which she said pays for roughly half of their $2,200 rent, Huertero wouldn’t know what to do. 
“Oh my gosh, if we didn’t have that, we probably wouldn’t be able to make rent,” she said, adding that even with the rental assistance she at times struggles to make ends meet between the cost of utilities, groceries and gas for her commute.  
Huertero — who was born in San Diego and moved to Utah decades ago, in 1996, in search of a better life — is one of hundreds of Utahns who could lose their Emergency Housing Voucher assistance earlier than expected unless Congress acts. 
But the program, faced with rising housing costs, is quickly running out of money. Federal officials expect the funds to run dry by the end of 2026, according to a letter HUD sent to housing agencies across the country, including those in Utah. It advised housing authorities to “manage your EHV program with the expectation that no additional funding from HUD will be forthcoming.” 
How many vouchers are at risk in Utah?
At least 281 vouchers are currently being used in Utah, according to HUD’s website. That number is small compared to other states like California, where nearly 15,500 vouchers are at risk, according to the Associated Press. In total, roughly 60,000 people across the country could lose their rental assistance and face eviction at the end of next year unless Congress sets more money aside for the program. 
Janice Kimball, CEO of Housing Connect (Salt Lake County’s housing authority) received one of those letters from HUD. In Salt Lake County, Emergency Housing Vouchers are helping keep at least 97 people or families housed. 
“I think for this fiscal year, we’re probably OK,” she told Utah News Dispatch. “But we’re really worried about next fiscal year.”

Looking ahead to when the funds are set to expire in 2026, Kimball said “we’re trying to figure out how to keep those folks housed” by transitioning them or absorbing them into other programs, wherever possible. The vast majority of Utahns receiving assistance through Housing Connect do so with Section 8 vouchers, which Kimball said support about 3,000 households.
But without more federal dollars, she said Salt Lake County would not be able to sustain its 97 Emergency Housing Vouchers long term. 
Utah youth homeless shelters face funding uncertainty amid federal cuts, freezes

“We don’t have enough of our own funds to do that,” she said, adding that the average cost per unit the vouchers help fund cost about $1,110 per month, “so we’re spending just over $110,000 per month to keep those households housed.” 
The Housing Authority of Salt Lake City has also distributed a big chunk of Utah’s Emergency Housing Vouchers. Currently, 77 vouchers are being used, according to Britnee Dabb, deputy director of Salt Lake City’s housing authority. 
Though Dabb said the authority has been allocated funding for 98 vouchers, she said her team has moved some of the households to other long-term programs they qualify for instead of waiting for the funds to expire. 
But as for the other 77 still in use? 
“If we can’t find programs that the households qualify for and are open, these families will lose the rent subsidy and have a large probability of becoming homeless,” Dabb said. 
What now?
To not cause a panic, Kimball said Housing Connect hasn’t been notifying renters just yet of the program’s expiration date, given there’s still so much uncertainty around what federal officials and Congress could do next. 
In the meantime, she said “we’re hoping that we’ll get additional information from HUD, and we’re hoping that we’ll have an idea of future funding, because that gives us the tools to know what we can do and what we can’t do.” 




How many Emergency Housing Vouchers are at risk in Utah

Salt Lake County Housing Authority: 97
Salt Lake City Housing Authority: 77
Provo Housing Authority: 27
Utah County Housing Authority: 32
Carbon County Housing Authority: 6
St. George Housing Authority: 17
Cedar City Housing Authority: 12




“The other thing that’s really frustrating is that Congress has not passed a budget for 2025, so we’re operating on information that we think is current based on last year,” she said. 
Since the program isn’t expected to end until around November 2026, Kimball added “we have a little bit of time to kind of think this through. So we’re hoping we can have the budget numbers in before we have to start making those calls.” 
Still, she worries the program’s expiration will cause a setback during a time when housing in Utah and across the country continues to be a painful issue for so many Utahns and Americans.
“Right now, there’s such a deficit of affordable housing that it’s really hard for low-income households to be able to find a stable place to live,” she said. “We should be adding to the mix to help families stay housed. And so, any resource that you remove from the community is detrimental.” 
Kimball said housing authorities are “going to do everything they can to keep people housed,” but she said now is a “good time” for Utahns to reach out to their congressional leaders and “let them know what the value of housing is for you and your family.” 
In the past, when voucher programs have been awarded and expire, they are usually extended, Kimball said, “and it’s because of this reason: once you get households or families entered into leases, it’s hard to unwind that. Usually it’s just been extended.” 
But under Trump’s administration and the GOP-controlled Congress, it’s unclear whether that will happen. 
Kimball said the Emergency Housing Voucher program has helped hundreds of Utahns move from unstable housing or homelessness, to a safe, affordable situation.










I can’t believe, honestly, that they would (stop) that funding. I mean, this population that I’m included in. We’re really vulnerable. We’ve been through a lot mentally.


– Juanita Huertero


“They have some choice in where they can live. It gives them breathing room. … They can start building from there,” she said. “Affordable housing is like the foundational game changer. It really keeps people stable and allows them to live.” 
Kimball said she “can’t even imagine having to tell these households that we can’t house them.” Though it hasn’t come to that, at least not yet, Kimball said she does worry it would be “devastating” to those renters. 
While Utah’s number of Emergency Housing Vouchers is small compared to other states, to Huertero, it would be life altering.

She said she’s been working hard to complete HUD’s five-year Family Self-Sufficiency Program — which helps teach budgeting, saving and other financial goals while setting aside money whenever Huertero gets a salary bump in an escrow account that she can later use to buy a home. But she said she probably has another four years before she could graduate from that program. 
If the Emergency Housing Voucher program expires, Huertero worries she’ll be forced to go back on affordable housing waitlists. 
“I’m going to get on any wait list I can, just in case,” she said. 
Thinking about thousands of others like her who are at risk losing their rental assistance, Huertero choked back tears. 
“I can’t believe, honestly, that they would (stop) that funding. I mean, this population that I’m included in. We’re really vulnerable. We’ve been through a lot mentally,” she said. “I’m really struggling to try to understand all this.”
She acknowledged that President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to reign in federal spending, but pointing to chaos and uncertainty around other frozen funds or cuts, Huertero said she wishes the approach could be more compassionate. 
“I get that, yeah, there are some things that really do need to change,” she said. “But it didn’t need to change all in one day, all in one month. You know, he has four years to make these changes.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Alabama arts programs may face up to $1 million in cuts if the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts funds for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).
The Alabama Council of the Arts said earlier this month it is anticipating cuts at the federal level soon. They said that representatives from DOGE were scheduled to visit NEA offices.
“Any cuts to federal funding for state partnerships would directly impact our grant programs, reducing our available funds by up to $1 million annually,” Executive Director Elliot Knight said in a statement Wednesday.
According to the Council, the NEA makes up 15% of its budget with the rest coming from the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund (ETF). The 2026 ETF received approval from the House on Tuesday, which included an $85,000 increase from the current budget and Gov. Kay Ivey’s 2026 recommendation.
The Council awarded $14.7 million in grants over the last five years, according to the statement. Knight also said the Council uses 100% of its federal funds for grants.
“Public funding for arts and creativity is a high-return investment that ensures all Alabamians have access to arts programming,” Knight said.
The federal cuts would have to be approved by Congress. 
“Please help us make sure that all members of Alabama’s Congressional delegation understand how Alabama workers and communities will be negatively impacted by the cuts to NEH and IMLS grants and potential cuts to NEA grants,” Knight said.
According to the statement, Poetry Out Loud is one program funded with federal dollars. The national arts education program that encourages high school students to learn about great poetry through memorization, performance and competition. Knight said this is one of the programs that would be impacted by NEA cuts.
“The arts are more than just an expression of beauty; they are a driver of innovation, contributing to Alabama’s economic growth and global competitiveness,” he said.

(Getty Images)As high summer temperatures start to creep across the state, about $1.4 million in federal funding meant to help low-income Nevadans pay utility bills is in limbo after the Trump administration fired every employee responsible for administering the funds.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) terminated the entire staff that allocates funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) as part of a broad effort by the White House to dramatically downsize the federal government. 
Federal funding for LIHEAP is approved by Congress and funneled through state programs which use the money to pay energy providers directly in order to help low-income families avoid shutoffs.
Consumer advocates warn that the layoffs could threaten or delay nearly $400 million in utility assistance funding that had not yet been distributed to states by the time the federal program was gutted. 
Nevada was awarded about $15 million in LIHEAP funding this year, but about $1.4 million of that funding is now in limbo after the program was essentially shuttered in early April. 
According to the Nevada Division of Welfare and Supportive Services — which administers the state’s LIHEAP funding —Nevada has not received the remaining 10% of its allocated funding as of Thursday. 
Earlier this month, Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen and several other Democratic senators sent a letter to HHS urging the agency to disburse all of the LIHEAP funds that Congress has appropriated.
“By terminating all 23 employees tasked with overseeing LIHEAP, it is now unclear how these funds will be administered. In our view, that is unacceptable,” reads the letter. “Failure to disburse these funds constitutes an illegal impoundment of bipartisan, congressionally appropriated funds and will put the health and well-being of some of the most vulnerable people in America at risk.”
HHS did not respond to a request for comment on the fate of Nevada’s remaining funding.
Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program received more than half its funding from LIHEAP last year, making it a vital source of utility assistance funding for the state.
Last year, Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program paid out more than $31 million in benefits to help more than 17,000 households in the state keep their power on. A portion of those funds were also used to help low-income households pay for upgrades that improve energy efficiency and lower power bills in the long term.
Still, as temperatures rise there is a growing demand for utility assistance funding in the state. Nearly 32,000 Nevadans had their power disconnected by NV Energy for nonpayment in 2024, according to data from the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada.
In southern Nevada, where temperatures reached 100 degrees or higher for 64 consecutive days in 2024, air conditioning is a life-saving necessity.
Extreme heat exposure is a serious health hazard. It can cause heat rash, cramps, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke, which can be fatal or have lifelong consequences. Older people, people with disabilities, pregnant people, and children are at increased risk of adverse health impacts from heat.
Without the remaining 10% of Nevada’s LIHEAP funding, the state won’t be able to provide financial assistance to as many households struggling to pay their energy bills.
The state’s ability to provide energy assistance could be reduced even more in 2026, as the Trump administration has signaled it could end the program next year. A leaked draft budget request document from the HHS proposes allocating zero funding for the LIHEAP program in 2026, according to reporting by the Hill. 
The U.S. Constitution puts Congress, not the president, in charge of federal spending, but the Trump administration has been challenging congressional power of the purse, with little pushback from Republicans in control of the legislative branch.
The administration’s  termination of LIHEAP programs and staff is raising alarms for consumer advocates. 
Keriann Conroy, a research associate with the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog organization, said any reduction in LIHEAP funding could be especially devastating for Nevada.
“It’s the main source of energy assistance funding that exists both nationwide and in the state of Nevada,” Conroy said. 
“This is absolutely a program people depend on. I think you’ll see the most vulnerable people being disconnected and being put in life threatening circumstances,” Conroy said. “Since most Nevadans are already struggling to pay their utility bills you’d see that extend to a larger group of people.”
Reno and Las Vegas are the two fastest-warming cities in the country, according to climate scientists at Climate Central. Heat played a role in the deaths of 527 people last year in Southern Nevada alone, according to the Southern Nevada Health District.
Yet, Nevada’s customer protections against utility companies disconnecting consumers during extreme weather are limited.
Nevada is one of 19 states that does not require utilities to publicly disclose the number of customers they disconnect to utility regulators, leaving little transparency to understand the full extent of disconnections. However, Nevada lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would require utilities to report disconnections by month and zip code.
Nevada also does not have a blanket moratorium on utility disconnections during months of extreme weather, like many other states do, including neighboring Arizona. 
“If LIHEAP assistance disappears, it will add insult to injury in a state with limited consumer protections. Nevada’s customer protections against utility companies disconnecting consumers during extreme weather are limited,” Conroy said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/electric-meter-1024x752.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 08:11:04.584635

The board is in charge of licensing commercial hunting guides, assistant guides and transporters. 
Since 2024, the state budget has included funding for a temporary executive director, but if Senate Bill 29 becomes law, the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development would be required to have a permanent executive director for the big game board. 
Several other regulated industries already have boards with permanent executive directors, and the cost of the director would be paid for with fees, said Sen. Jesse Bjorkman, R-Nikiski and the sponsor of SB 29.
The bill was supported by Safari Club International, the Alaska Professional Hunters Association and other trade groups.

That’s what the Confederacy was about, and it’s never been a secret. Ulysses S. Grant wrote in his memoirs that the Southern cause was “one of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse.”
He added that he did not question “the sincerity of the great mass of those who were opposed to us.”
Neither do I. These men were honest in their racism like a vulture is straightforward about its plans for a dying animal.
Some may consider that impolite. Many believe that the South’s profound inhumanity was a kind of trick pulled off by elites. In this telling, the people at the top invented or extended racism to keep poor whites, whose griefs came from the enslavers and not the enslaved, distracted and unable to form potentially powerful class-based alliances. Gaslit into confusion, lower-class whites became the unthinking tools of the aristocrat pulling strings from a secure perch.
If this was the whole tale, Reconstruction would have been as challenging as a home remodeling project.  Swap Slaveholder A for Public Servant B. Alabama’s myriad issues with education and public health — all of which have roots in slavery — would be far less dire.
The problem is that it treats racism as little more than a tool for rich whites and a fog around poor ones. With a little time and a bit of sunshine, the mists of hatred would evaporate and people would see the world clearly.
But nearly all whites, whether rich or poor, chose to drink from the same polluted well. The poison seeped into their blood and penetrated their bones. It left many white men convinced that their own roles leading their households depended on keeping Black Americans in bondage.
“The hidden assumptions and values that underlay their political choices were forged in the relationships that engaged them most directly,” the historian Stephanie McCurry wrote in “Masters of Small Worlds.” “With the few slaves they may have owned, but, just as importantly, with the women and other family dependents they presumed it their natural right to rule. Whether slaveholders or not, yeoman household heads were, as they proudly proclaimed, masters.”
Maybe the ordinary farmer didn’t like the slaveholder’s house or his allies shifting taxes to him. But when the rich man spoke of domination and order, he heard his own dark thoughts. He saw a peer.
And when those elites declared war on the federal government, he picked up a gun, grabbed starvation-level rations and killed American soldiers. And he sang all the way.
The brackish water of racism freed him from any concern about his position or any desire for something better. In his mind, liberty grew from the chain on a Black American. That was worth a bullet or a fatal illness in a filthy tent.
Lewis Parsons, the governor of Alabama, estimated after the war that 122,000 Alabamians — more than a fifth of the prewar white population — took up arms for racism. Somewhere between 27,000 and 35,000 of them died for it. (Perhaps 3,000 white Alabamians fought for the Union, while 5,000 Black Alabamians took on the blue.)
Tens of thousands more were injured. God knows how much undiagnosed trauma went home to their families, their children and future generations.
Given the choice, I would fire every single Confederate holiday into the sun. But if the state insists on having them, we may look at those men decaying beneath the Stars and Bars and reflect on where embracing authoritarianism leads.
Decades of family and children and love cleaved by hate and ended by a firearm, a shell or a virus.
Lives reduced to a flag without a country and a cause no decent person honors.
A pointless sacrifice to the fickle god of malice.
Today we see many people surrounding the poisoned well that fed that destruction, pushing and shoving to get a taste.
Drink from it, and almost everything else falls away. The economy burns, and the rule of law dies, but they have a sense of peace. They smile as corruption thrives and their savings evaporate. Nothing matters except their rapturous vision of a person with brown skin suffering.
In that hateful daze, they nod as the administration locks people up without trial. While scholars are hounded. And as the bright future down a more difficult path fades away.
What comes of that? What does it leave behind?
A graveyard. A field of faded tombstones in dead soil, acidic from the hatred leaching out of the buried bones.
And on this sterile ground, the Confederate flags bloom.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House Health Committee Wednesday approved a bill raising the age of consent for medical care from 14 to 16.
SB 101, sponsored by Sen. Larry Stutts, R-Tuscumbia, would require parental consent for medical, dental, and mental health services for minors under 16 and prohibit health care providers and governmental entities from denying parents access to a child’s health record.
“Since 1972, the age of consent for all medical care in Alabama, from dental health to general health to mental health, has been 14 years of age, and this bill seeks to raise it to 16,” said Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, who is handling the legislation in the House.

DuBose said that although the bill would have originally raised the age of consent to 18 years, she and Stutts worked with the medical community to arrive at the compromise.
 “I understand the concerns of all these medical professionals, and while I may not have wanted 16 to begin with, I wanted 18. We all did. This is far better than 14, and I think sometimes that’s what we end up doing on legislation, is working with everybody and coming to the best compromise that we can all live with,” DuBose said.
She added that a key part of the bill is ensuring that parents can access their minor child’s medical records.
“The good thing about this bill is it does provide parents with access to all medical records of their minor child, and so I’m very happy with that,” she said.
The bill provides several exemptions to the age of consent requirement. Minors under 16 who are pregnant or emancipated can make their own medical decisions. Minors under 16 can also consent to services related to sexually transmitted diseases and alcohol or drug misuse. Health care professionals would also be allowed to provide emergency services without parental consent under specific circumstances, including imminent threats to the minor’s health, suspected abuse, neglect or exploitation.
“We try to have common sense carve outs in this law,” DuBose said in a phone interview Friday.
The bill can now be considered by the full House.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.
GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Doctor makes case for expanding Nevada Medicaid coverage of anti-obesity drugs

Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wegovy.jpg,,,2025-04-28 09:08:44.284178

Medicaid is the country’s biggest health plan, covering more than 70 million Americans. Known as HUSKY in Connecticut, Medicaid covers roughly 1 million people in the state, according to the Department of Social Services, which equals just about 25% of the population. 
States depend heavily on the federal government to pay for the program. The state’s Office of Policy and Management projects Connecticut will spend a total of $11.6 billion on Medicaid this fiscal year. The federal government contributed roughly $6.9 billion, or 59%, of that funding.
Democrats across the country are sounding the alarm that the Trump administration’s budget priorities will threaten the federal funding that’s critical to Medicaid. Both chambers of the U.S. Congress recently passed a measure crafted by Republicans that instructed the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion in spending. 
The resolution doesn’t direct the committee to cut Medicaid specifically, and President Donald J. Trump has insisted that his administration will not cut the program. But, based on the spending that the committee handles, Medicaid would likely need to be part of the equation, which could lead to reductions in access for enrollees. 
Here’s what you need to know.
What will the cuts mean for providers and patients?
Medicaid covers all types of services for its enrollees, including medical and behavioral health services, substance abuse treatment, as well as in-home and nursing home care for seniors and people with disabilities. It’s unlikely that we’ll know the full details of how Medicaid cuts will play out until the summer, when Congress is expected to vote on the final budget for fiscal year 2026. 
“There’s all kinds of ideas swirling around about how they would implement [cuts]. They’re all bad,” U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said during a press conference in Hartford earlier this month.
Providers are already bracing for the changes, saying they may have to pare back services if cuts go through.
Glenn Connan, chief financial officer at Midwestern Connecticut Council on Alcoholism, a substance abuse treatment provider in Danbury, said he worries his organization would have to shutter some of its clinics, despite surging demand for services.
“Any further cuts to Medicaid [and] we’re gonna have to start closing some of those seven outpatient clinics and just having maybe three,” Connan told elected officials during an event earlier this month in Danbury focused on potential Medicaid cuts. “That’s gonna hurt the people in those communities.”
Jeffrey Shenberger, division head of neonatology at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, said Medicaid cuts would impact some of his most vulnerable patients — babies in the neonatal intensive care unit. 
“Cuts would lead to fewer resources within the acute care process within the NICU. And it would impact all families and all children. It’s regardless of whether they’re private pay, self-pay or paid through Medicaid,” Shenberger told attendees during an April press conference at Connecticut Children’s in Hartford.
Medicaid covers roughly 40% of births in Connecticut, according to health policy organization KFF.
How would Medicaid cuts impact state finances?
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration is modeling out what the cuts to Medicaid would mean for the state budget. While it’s unclear how the federal government would pare back spending, the impacts of all cuts Congress is considering would put enormous stress on the state’s finances. 
Right now, the federal government covers at least 50% of all the state’s Medicaid costs. But, Congress may decide to, instead, offer a fixed amount per Medicaid enrollee, regardless of how many or which types of services they use. Under this scenario, Connecticut would lose $1.35 billion over the next seven years, or an average of $193 million per year, according to the Department of Social Services.
The feds may also lower or abandon the current guarantee that Washington reimburses at least 50% of all states’ Medicaid costs. In that case, Connecticut stands to lose up to a staggering $3.5 billion in federal reimbursements, DSS estimates. The funding represents just over half of the projected federal reimbursements Connecticut received this fiscal year.
Officials have said it’s too early to focus on how the state might trim Medicaid under some nightmare scenario. But, there are benefits that Connecticut offers that aren’t required for states to participate in Medicaid. These include dental and pharmaceutical coverage, and home care for elderly patients.
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, who co-chairs the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee, told The Connecticut Mirror she isn’t ready to accept any cutbacks.
“We’re not pre-supposing …  in a program as important as Medicaid,” Osten said. “We’re not going to start off looking at cuts to programs that keep people alive — and that’s what Medicaid does.”

He was the first agent to be killed in the line of duty in Maryland.
Brother Martinez was a beloved coworker, brother and son. He was an active member of his union, AFSCME Local 3661, which represents thousands of state employees who work in public safety and community corrections. For the last year, my fellow union members and I have been mourning his loss, and we are still deeply hurt and angry at the departmental and policy failures that led to this tragedy.
Sadly, Brother Martinez was not alone. In 2024, our union also lost Brother Ronald Silver II and Brother Timothy Cartwell. They were both sanitation workers for Baltimore City’s Department of Public Works, and both died from preventable incidents while on the job.

We know there are dangers that come with our professions, but the glaring truth is that for too long, Maryland’s public employers have failed to make the health and safety of their employees a priority. Public sector workers in Maryland consistently face more than double the rates of occupational injuries and illnesses of their private sector counterparts, 5.4 cases compared to 2.3 cases per 100 full-time workers, respectively.
But for the first time, my fellow union members and I have some hope.
This year, our union was successful in passing the Davis Martinez Public Employee Safety and Health Act, sponsored by Sen. Ben Kramer (D-Montgomery) and Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery). This legislation marks a critical turning point in our fight for safe and healthy workplaces.
For years, Maryland law has failed to hold public sector employers accountable for violating workplace safety standards. While private sector employers can face financial penalties, public sector employers are simply given a slap on the wrist, even though our safety is entrusted to them from the moment we clock in. The Davis Martinez Act changes that.
This important legislation will hold all public employers accountable for the safety of their workers and add in financial consequences for failing to protect employees. With the Davis Martinez Act, Maryland will now become only the third state in the nation — joining New York and California — to require a Workplace Violence Prevention standard that covers the entire public sector.
On this Workers’ Memorial Day, a day where we remember those who have lost their lives or been injured or made sick on the job, I can’t help but reflect on the lives that could have been saved had our public sector employers been proactive in creating and enforcing policies and procedures to keep us safe on the job.
In honor of the legacies of our fallen union brothers, it’s up to us to make Maryland a state that truly values the lives, safety, and health of each and every worker. In honor of Brother Martinez, Brother Silver and Brother Cartwell, we expect every public sector employer to work collaboratively with us, the workers who keep Maryland running, to implement these key reforms in good faith, because everyone deserves to return home safely from work at the end of the day.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DSC_0097-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 08:11:04.584635

Access to affordable child care is something that concerns all Vermonters, even those who do not have children.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mirna Valerio: I Love Vermont for Its Mountains — and Its Commitment to Child Care.","This commentary is by Mirna Valerio. She is a Winooski-based ultrarunner, advocate for the outdoors and author of the book “A Beautiful Work in Progress.” As an athlete and advocate for the outdoors, I was attracted to Vermont’s incredible mountains, its stewardship of natural resources, its quirky downtowns with local bookstores and cafes, rural landscapes with farm stands and fresh zucchini…lots and lots of zucchini. But the primary reason for choosing to settle my family in the Green Mountain State was because of its values — including its commitment to progress on child care. Vermont is full of hardy folk who take action for the benefit of their community. Because of the hard work of over 40,000 Vermonters, our state has become a national leader on child care. Act 76 — the 2023 law that provides desperately-needed, long-term funding for accessible and affordable child care — has emerged as one of the most transformative actions on child care at the state-level. Access to affordable child care is something that concerns all Vermonters, even those who do not have children. My son is already a junior in college, and neither of us would be where we are today without having had access to affordable, quality child care.I taught in day and boarding schools for 18 years, working within 24/7 schedules. I often had to be at school very early and tended to students in the dorm until fairly late at night, all while attending graduate school and teaching privately on the weekends. Access to quality child care and a trusted professional educator who cared for and loved my son allowed me to focus on taking care of my family and my career. Miss Barbara, who ran a child care program in her home, had a background in early childhood education and used several different curricula to teach the children in her program. My son loved going to Miss Barbara’s — he enjoyed playing and learning with the other children, the guided walks outside, and her delicious homemade food! Meanwhile, with Ms. Barbara’s care and teachings, his language and communication improved vastly, as did his social skills and physical development.Early childhood educators (ECEs) are professionals with specialized knowledge and training. The only way to bolster a diverse, well-prepared, and well-supported ECE workforce is with professional compensation and respect for the essential work they do to help care for and educate our children. And there are many Vermont families with young children who would and could benefit from more robust child care options. Access to affordable and professional child care empowers parents to participate in the economy. It allows them to be fully present in their workplaces. And, when we are less worried and anxious about where our children will be during the day, we have more time to dream, to create businesses that contribute to the economy and livelihood of our state. Our children experience the benefits of having parents and caregivers who have the time and freedom to work. When we invest in common-sense solutions that support families and our economy, we keep people and businesses in our Green Mountain State. Public investment in child care does just that.The 2025 legislative session has big implications for child care. As lawmakers in Montpelier make critical state funding decisions, they need to hear from us that child care is an absolute priority for Vermonters. Our state representatives and senators have an opportunity to build on a solution that’s working. Doing so would increase access and lower costs for child care while supporting our workforce and preparing our youngest children for school.I love our state. I love that my job lets me experience so much of it and share it with others. Neither my son nor I would be where we are today without the luck we had in accessing quality early education. So, let’s build a Vermont where it’s not just about luck but, instead, about our values and creating a community where we can all thrive — and that all starts with access to quality, affordable child care.

Twelve states are suing President Donald Trump and officials in his administration over tariffs that have touched nearly all goods imported into the United States.
The suit, State of Oregon, et al., v. Trump, et al., was filed last week by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 11 other Democratic state attorneys general in the Court of International Trade in New York. It names Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and its leader, Peter Flores.
The attorneys general — from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont — are challenging four of Trump’s executive orders that have added a 145% tariff on most imports from China, a 25% tariff on most imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on most all other goods imported to the U.S. The suit also preemptively challenges Trump’s plan to raise tariffs on imports from more than 40 other countries on July 9, according to a news release from the Oregon Attorney General’s Office.
“​​We cannot sit quietly while the president takes actions that are going to cost us jobs, increase the prices that we pay, and harm our economy,” Rayfield told reporters Wednesday at a news conference held at the Oregon Department of Justice in Portland.
Experts estimate tariffs could raise the cost of living for the average family nationwide by more than $3,800 a year, according to a report from the Budget Lab at Yale University.
Rayfield and the other attorneys general argue Trump is unlawfully using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs that are, under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, powers granted only to Congress, not the executive branch. The 1977 Emergency Economic Powers Act gives the president broad latitude on financial regulation and foreign policy if a national emergency, described as an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” is declared.
The attorneys general argue no such threat exists, and that no president before Trump has imposed tariffs based on the Emergency Economic Powers Act.
“Congress has the sole authority to set tariff policy,” Rayfield said. “Congress has enacted various laws that allow the president to implement tariffs under certain conditions, but most importantly, certain safeguards. And it’s these conditions and safeguards that the president doesn’t like.”
Employment fears
Rayfield was joined by state Rep. Daniel Nguyễn, D-Lake Oswego, and co-founder of Portland-based Bambuza Vietnam Kitchen; Pat Hubbell, owner of Brooklyn Pharmacy in Portland; Graham Trainor, president of Oregon AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 300,000 unionized Oregonians working in construction, education, health care and manufacturing; Todd Nelson, co-owner of Bountiful Farms in Woodburn; Cody Sullivan, the first person with Down syndrome to graduate with a four-year degree from an Oregon college, and Ann Donaca, Sullivan’s aide and a retired educator.
Nguyễn said Bambuza, like all businesses, is struggling to deal with the economic insecurity wrought by the tariffs. He said the business has stocked many of its Vietnamese imports, such as rice paper, rice noodles and coffee, but he knows they will not last long.
“This survival mentality might save an individual business in a pinch, but it can’t be sustained, and it can be devastating for our broader economy,” he said.
Trainor said Trump’s erratic use of tariffs lacks a clear strategy, making them detrimental rather than beneficial for workers. He said many union members are “wondering if their jobs will still exist tomorrow.”
“What we need is a comprehensive trade policy that puts workers first,” he said. “That means targeting unfair trade practices, investing in domestic industries and ensuring that tariffs are used strategically, not just as political weapons.”
Sullivan has been applying for jobs unsuccessfully for three years. Donaca said that’s only going to get harder in an economy where hiring slows altogether due to economic uncertainty.
Feeling the pain
Both Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek and Oregon U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, held roundtables recently with small- and medium- business owners to discuss the impact of tariffs.
Business leaders told Kotek April 16 they were frustrated at the speed and inconsistency with which tariffs are being issued, and some said their businesses might not survive if tariffs continue for much longer.
“We believe manufacturers our size are going to go under,” Emma Mcilroy, CEO of Portland-based clothing company Wildfang, told Kotek.
Oregon’s state economist, Carl Riccadonna, joined Kotek’s roundtable discussion. He has encouraged business owners to take a survey from Business Oregon, the state’s economic development agency, so it can gather more information about tariff impacts.
Riccadonna said the full impact of tariffs on Oregon’s economy — measured by growth of new or existing businesses, increases in hiring and decreases in inflation — likely won’t be known until mid-summer.
At a roundtable with businesses held at the Port of Portland Monday, Wyden said he and Kentucky U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican, would introduce legislation to end Trump’s tariffs as early as this week.
Wyden described it as “one of the most important matters I’ve ever been involved with in my entire life.”
“I think the stakes are that high,” he said.

Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.Los Angeles pediatrician and urgent care specialist Dr. Ilan Shapiro worries for his chronically ill patients as he watches Congress weigh significant cuts to Medicaid.
He thinks of a boy who, before finding Shapiro’s clinic, was in and out of emergency rooms and intensive care units because of severe asthma attacks, instead of competing in soccer games and studying for exams. The boy’s parents were losing hours and pay at work with the frequent ER visits.
Shapiro, who is Latino, works at a federally qualified health care center, a clinic for low-income patients. Most of his patients are people of color on Medicaid, and roughly a quarter of them are children.
Research shows Latino and Black family physicians are more likely to see Medicaid patients compared with their white and Asian counterparts. Experts say the Medicaid cuts Congress is weighing would strap health care centers that rely on already-low Medicaid reimbursements, disproportionately affecting communities of color and the physicians they rely on.



It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.


– Dr. Ilan Shapiro



Of the 72 million people covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, more than half are people of color, with Black and Hispanic people disproportionately represented on the rolls.
Black and Hispanic patients have a higher risk of conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease and certain cancers, making health care access crucial.
Congressional Republicans are considering $880 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. Conservatives have long argued that Medicaid is too expensive. They assert its expansion under the Affordable Care Act to more working adults has diverted too much money toward nondisabled people, taking resources away from vulnerable populations the program was originally intended to help.
But clinicians and policy analysts say the federal Medicaid cuts could have an especially detrimental impact on vulnerable enrollees, including children, older adults and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, as states are forced to find savings to fill the gap.

One GOP proposal targeting Medicaid expansion could lead to reductions in children’s health insurance programs, according to a February report by the Urban Institute. The think tank estimates that proposed cuts to federal Medicaid expansion spending could increase the number of uninsured kids by 11.8%.
“I’m deeply afraid,” said Shapiro. “It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.”
Bias and language barriers 
Just 6% of U.S. physicians are Latino and 5% are Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Sustaining the relatively few medical practices with Black and Hispanic providers is important amid evidence that racial bias, lack of access to culturally competent care and language barriers lead to poorer health outcomes or access.
For example, analyses have shown Black patients are less likely to be prescribed pain medication, and some clinicians hold false ideas that Black patients have a higher pain tolerance. Nearly 1 in 3 Black, Hispanic and multiracial women reported mistreatment in medical settings during pregnancy and delivery, such as receiving no help when asking for it or being shouted at, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
Language barriers, which Latino communities are more likely to face, are also associated with poorer health or limited access to health care.

“We understand the language and cultural concordance and the improved outcomes,” said Dr. Linda Mirdamadi, an adjunct clinical assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine who serves on the National Hispanic Medical Association’s board of directors. “There’s a sense of trust.”
Mirdamadi said federal cuts to Medicaid would lead to loss of preventive care for her large, diverse community.
“If they don’t have access to health care, they’re not going to have the access to chronic disease prevention, to vaccines, to cancer prevention screening,” she said. “It is going to just increase the disparity gaps that already exist.”
‘Ripple effect’ 
Dr. Roger Mitchell, president-elect of the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians, said a widespread loss of Medicaid coverage would affect everybody, even people with private insurance. People without health coverage often don’t have primary doctors and forgo preventive care, resulting in more trips to the emergency room. That can lead to longer wait times at ERs for everyone, regardless of their health insurance.
Mitchell also pointed out that Medicaid reimbursements are a major funding stream for hospitals and clinics that see a lot of enrollees. Without that money, many of those providers might be forced to scale back their services or close.
“The ripple effect is enormous,” said Mitchell, who heads Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., where about 40% of patients are covered by Medicaid. “This is an issue that’s not just affecting one portion of the U.S. populace, but all of us, and has the potential to have huge harm.”

Dr. Zita Magloire is a family physician, but she also offers obstetric care along with two OB-GYNs at Cairo Medical Care in the south Georgia city of Cairo. The city is the county seat of Grady County, which has about 26,000 residents, almost 30% of whom are Black.
Her practice is one of the few in the area that takes Medicaid for obstetric care, she noted, and serves many Central American immigrant patients who drive from the surrounding rural areas to her clinic. When another practice in the area started cutting services, her center absorbed those patients.
“There’s not a lot of providers that accept Medicaid,” she said. “What does that look like? Well, they [patients] show up with no prenatal care — and then, you have very high-risk patients.”
Back in Los Angeles, the boy whose family found Shapiro’s clinic is now a teenager. He received stable asthma care there and got Medicaid coverage.
“He started having a medical home. Everything changed. The ER visits and the intensive care unit visits changed to soccer games,” Shapiro said. Having coverage, he continued, “makes a huge impact for the entire community.”

On Thursday, April 17, a 20-year-old boy, a student, walked around FSU’s sunny campus, firing a handgun. Two dead; six injured.
The response from our elected leaders? The usual: “Thoughts and prayers.”
The governor of the State of Florida said he was “praying,” adding, “We are all Seminoles today.”
First Lady Casey DeSantis: “Praying.”
Sen. Rick Scott: Also “praying.”
The president of the United States called the attack “terrible, a shame,” then blew off any suggestion of gun control reform, saying he’s a “big advocate of the Second Amendment.”
Maybe he missed the praying memo.
I teach at FSU; and that Thursday afternoon, I was locked down in my office.
It was frightening, yes; it was also horribly familiar. This is America: Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Columbine, Uvalde, Nashville, Parkland.
The Tallahassee Democrat reported that several survivors of the 2018 Marjorie Stoneman Douglas shooting were on campus that day.
Robbie Alhadeff’s sister Alyssa died at MSD: “Something has to change,” he said.
Graduate student Stephanie Horowitz saw people running and knew instantly what was happening.
Jason Leavy was a freshman at MSD when Nikolas Cruz murdered 17 people. He knew, too, and started barricading his classroom door.
 “It’s the least surprising thing in the world, honestly,” he said.
Every one of those kids has been through multiple active shooter drills. Many faculty have, too.
We are supposed to shove desks against our doors, turn off the lights, “harden” our schools and churches and college campuses and act as though we’re grateful when politicians express their insincere and frankly insulting “sympathy.”
Nobody wants their feeble prayers and, as for their thoughts, if the violence-loving reactionaries in charge of this state were actually capable of thoughts they’d realize things do not have to be this way.
 Priorities
From the state Capitol to the U.S. Capitol, politicians shrug: Guns matter more than people; children, high school students, college students — they don’t give the big money to political campaigns.
The Second Amendment trumps all the others.
We’re supposed to accept there’s nothing anyone can do: This is just the way things are.
As The Onion’s evergreen mass shooting headline goes, “‘No Way to Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.”
But the kids ain’t all right; the kids are scared — and furious.
  Florida State University students marched to the Capitol on April 23, 2025, less than a week after a gunman opened fire on their campus, calling for legislation on guns and school safety. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)
Last Tuesday, a group of FSU students braved the morally noxious fumes of the Capitol to demand sensible gun control, red flag laws, firearm storage legislation — commonsense stuff like that.
Madalyn Probst, president of the FSU College Democrats, said, “The fact that they are able to sit in this place and prioritize weapons over my life, my friends’ lives, and the lives of my community around me is deplorable.”
Problem is, the grown folks in charge don’t care.










“The fact that they are able to sit in this place and prioritize weapons over my life, my friends’ lives, and the lives of my community around me is deplorable.”


– Madalyn Probst, FSU College Democrats


The Florida House has approved a bill allowing 18-year-olds to buy guns, repealing a law they passed after the murders at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School.
We don’t let them drink, but hell, they can get themselves a nice Taurus 9mm semi-automatic handgun — just like the one used to kill three and wound five at Michigan State University in 2023.
Here at FSU, you can still see the mountains of flowers and teddy bears where the wounded and dead fell. Yet the governor — who has the emotional intelligence of a poison dart frog —continues to push what he calls “Second Amendment Summer.”
If you’re buying a gun or ammo between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, you don’t have to pay sales tax.
Because we want more people packing heat.
‘Protecting’ children
The FSU atrocity was Florida’s sixth mass shooting and the 27th school shooting in the nation.
This year. So far.
The grown folks in charge are obsessed with “protecting” children from fluoride and potentially life-saving vaccines.
No letting them near books like “And Tango Makes Three,” lest they want to become gay.
No letting them discover trans people and queer people are real and deserving of dignity.
They can’t stand the thought of high schoolers reading Toni Morrison’s “Beloved” or “The 1619 Project,” lest they learn about the horrors of slavery.
They are terrified college students might study sociology, delve into political theories suggesting organizational models for the state that don’t insist our version of rapacious capitalism is the best, or encounter books that challenge religious or cultural orthodoxies.
As for sex, they don’t even want to think about it — unless, of course, the teenaged daughter gets pregnant or the teenaged son gets an STD.
They insist on shielding kids from a slew of normal human realities, but not gun violence.
It’s OK for young people to grow up knowing how to barricade themselves inside a classroom or learn strategies for evading a mass shooter but not appreciate poetry or play a musical instrument or master a foreign language.
It’s OK for them to live scared of that loner kid or that angry-looking guy or some person they can’t see, someone who wants to spill as much blood as possible.
The freedom to get a gun any time for any reason is more important.
So, we have Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Columbine, Uvalde, Nashville, Parkland, and now FSU.
United Against Hate
One of my students reminded me there was supposed to be a “United Against Hate” symposium in honor of Maura Binkley on April 17.
Maura Binkley was the student shot and killed at a yoga studio in 2018 along with another woman.
The symposium was to promote campus safety, but it had to be canceled.
The FSU building where it should have taken place was a crime scene.
Maura Binkley was murdered by a guy who hated women.
The young man who allegedly walked around campus shooting his classmates hates people of color — he’s a Trump supporter and a white supremacist.
He told a fellow student Black people were ruining his neighborhood.
The United States government manufactures hatred against anyone who’s not a white Christian, embracing violence against its citizens.
Nowhere is safe.

These facilities are dangerous for the people […],"Photo by Alex Potemkin/Getty Images.Minnesota taxpayers entrust our government with billions of dollars each year to make Minnesota a safe and dignified place to live — including for people in prison. It’s hard to believe we might throw away hundreds of millions of dollars trying to salvage 100-year-old prisons in deep disrepair. These facilities are dangerous for the people living and working inside. The only safe and affordable option is to close them once and for all.
In February 2025, the Minnesota Office of the Ombuds for Corrections released an urgent update to its 2024 report on the state of Minnesota correctional facilities. Both reports paint a dire picture for two of the state’s prisons in Stillwater and St. Cloud, which together house around 2,300 individuals: these prisons are crumbling.
Moreover, as these prisons continue to deteriorate, our state’s prison population is growing. According to a recent report by the Crime and Justice Institute — a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that partners with jurisdictions nationwide to improve justice systems — Minnesota’s prison population has been rising faster than in other states since the pandemic. From 2021 to 2022, our incarceration rate grew by 8% compared to just 2% nationally, for instance. 
The human cost of the increasingly crowded prisons and their disrepair is devastating. In an op-ed last year, Maurice L. Ward—CEO of Justice Impacted Individuals Voting Effectively — described his experience in the Stillwater prison as “living in a coffin but not buried underground,” where the temperature inside felt like “120 degrees.” Folks inside have been moved to create powerful art, tell important stories and stage peaceful demonstrations to illustrate the inhumanity of such conditions. This alone should be enough to reconsider the future of these facilities.
But it gets worse. The old-fashioned layout of these facilities — with stacked cells — reduces corrections officers’ line of sight, creating additional safety risks in an already dangerous environment where lockdowns can, and do, emerge at a moment’s notice. 
Additionally, the financial cost of facility maintenance is massive: The Department of Corrections estimates operating the correctional facilities in both Stillwater and St. Cloud costs almost $100 million, while the cost of urgent repairs at just St. Cloud is an estimated $71 million. We’re talking about nearly $200 million just for business as usual, which still leaves the people living and working in these facilities in danger. 
Once you factor in the amount of work required to address the long-term infrastructure issues, this price tag skyrockets. Standing water, falling bricks, leaky roofs, plumbing problems, and excessive heat during the warmer months make living and working at these prisons inhumane. A 2014 study to replace the St. Cloud facility projected a cost that amounts to an estimated $730 million in today’s dollars. Should we spend this much to replace just one of these crumbling prisons? The DOC itself calls this “the epitome of throwing good money after bad.”
Minnesota lawmakers know the importance of an individual’s successful reentry after incarceration, as evidenced by the passage of recent laws that incentivize participation in prison programming for those in custody, like substance abuse disorder treatment, medical and mental health services, and vocational, career and education training. This programming is impossible in crumbling facilities lacking usable spaces.
We understand that breaking the law and causing significant harm to people, property and society requires accountability. We ask Minnesotans to imagine what accountability mechanisms will be possible if we invest in the human potential of those who live and work inside these facilities. 
As statewide decision-makers consider long-term solutions, the economic and human costs of addressing the issues in Stillwater and St. Cloud mount daily. We can spend hundreds of millions of dollars trying to fix or replace these unfixable prisons, or we can take that money and build a plan that keeps communities safe and uplifts the humanity of every resident. The Minnesota Justice Research Center joins the chorus of people urging the immediate decommissioning of these prisons. 
Do you have thoughts about the future of Minnesota’s crumbling prisons? Join us for a community conversation hosted by the MNJRC and We Are All Criminals at the Weisman Art Museum on May 8, 2025. 
We’ll view powerful pieces in the SEEN exhibit, hear from the Office of Ombuds for Corrections and CJI about their reports, discuss what we know, and work together to reimagine the future of these facilities — because we don’t have another option.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/barbed-wire.jpg,,,2025-04-28 07:05:32.612611

And despite big health care reform talk, few fixes survived a breakneck session marked by a dismal revenue forecast.
 Three things on our list that didn’t make the cut, and one that did

The time of death was 10:12 p.m.
That’s when House Speaker Todd Huston announced a package of technical corrections would be the last to make it through a critical procedural step.
Community advocates celebrated the defeat of shuffled-around language they maintained would have criminalized homelessness. Sleeping or sheltering on government property would’ve been a Class C misdemeanor.

One version would have required local law enforcement to consider emergency detention, offer transportation to temporary shelter and contact crisis intervention specialists before making an arrest — an attempt to connect homeless Hoosiers to help, supporters maintained.
But the original, long-dead bill only provided a legal defense: no nearby shelter. It was the work of the Cicero Institute, a Texas think tank pushing such policies around the country.
“In these times of economic volatility, the most vulnerable Hoosiers and the community organizations who serve them can sleep a little better knowing their elected officials chose not to force local law enforcement to fine and jail people just for not being able to afford a place to lay their heads,” Prosperity Indiana policy head Andrew Bradley wrote in an early Friday news release. His organization was among the proposal’s fiercest opponents. 
Some lawmakers joined in, too. 
“I worked hard to ensure this legislation never became law,” Sen. Ron Alting, R-Lafayette, said in an early Friday statement. “The solution to homelessness is not incarceration.”
The General Assembly also snuffed out a contentious set of regulations for marijuana-like products, after seven rounds of substantial edits failed to ease concerns.
Products with legally low concentrations of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol have proliferated in Indiana, alongside those containing delta-8 THC and other isomers. Although lawmakers have repeatedly failed to regulate the nascent industry, they seemed poised to do so this session through Senate Bill 478.

But it never emerged from closed-door negotiations over a final version. Critics, including Indiana’s attorney general and anti-marijuana groups, maintained the language would expand existing loopholes instead of closing them.
“I just think we couldn’t get to a place of agreement, you know?” Huston told reporters early Friday. “… I just don’t think we were ready yet.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray said it was “tricky” to “get it absolutely right,” adding, “We just wanted to be certain that we didn’t move forward in a way that wasn’t in the state’s best interest.”
Lawmakers had hoped to “get some small piece of that across the line,” like a 21-plus age restriction, he told reporters, but “ran out of time.” He cited young children who may rely on cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive anticonvulsant, to treat seizures.
“We’ll come back, I can promise you, next year, and get something passed,” Bray said.
And one legislator’s attempt to fight human trafficking in massage parlors — following arrests in his district — was stripped out of an awareness measure.
Rep. Wendy McNamara, repeatedly dubbed the detailed regulations appended to House Enrolled Act 1416 overly “prescriptive” before cutting them. McNamara, R-Evansville, is an influential force in criminal matters and was among the co-authors.
  Sen. Mike Bohacek speaks with a colleague while the Senate is in session on Wednesday, April 23, 2025. He spent several days attempting to re-home language about massage parlors.(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, vowed to find another place for it in comments to the Indiana Capital Chronicle. But he admitted defeat — for now.
“This is something I’m going to continue to work on through the summer and into the next session, so we get some good language around this,” Bohacek said on the Senate floor. “The practices that are happening there (in massage parlors) is something we need to address for human trafficking in the future.”
One concept that did cross the finish line? A ban of mysterious origin on government-supported “obscene performances.” And “any person” could seek injunctive relief.
Indiana already has detailed obscenity laws on the books, and no one gave any examples of problematic performances being paid for by government. 
It was first spliced into legislation cracking down on child sex abuse materials, with the lawsuit provision inserted on the House floor. Then, as the end of session loomed, it was wedged into House Enrolled Act 1014, which previously focused on misdemeanors.
“Your shoulders have to be really aching from all the water that you’re carrying on this bill,” Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, told sponsor Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange.
He and other opponents feared the language would have little practical effect, instead “chilling” activities some simply may “disagree with” and putting local governments at legal risk.
 Trailer language walks back pieces of property tax legislation

Republicans also made eleventh-hour changes to a Department of Local Government and Finance (DLGF) measure, baking in trailer language to a contentious property tax bill that passed — and was signed into law — a week prior.
The final version of House Enrolled Act 1427 approved by the House and Senate in the last hours of the session deletes an increase in the business personal property tax exemption for 2025 that was previously approved in Senate Enrolled Act 1. Instead of jumping to $1 million in 2025, the exemption will remain at the $80,000 in current law and rise to $2,000,000 starting with the 2026 assessment date and beyond.
“One of my biggest concerns with our initiatives this year was the movement with business personal property tax, and I know that the $2 million exemption is for the 2026 assessment,” said Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, hours before the end of session. He discussed the trailer language, briefly, in the House Rules Committee.
“What I’m hoping for, as we get closer to that point in time, is we’re going to take a real hard look and get some local runs to see what that looks like for our local communities,” he continued. “My district is very heavily reliant on business personal property. This is kicked down the road a little bit, so we can’t really see a lot of trouble in the runs now. But going forward, as we get closer … I would hope that we would be able to talk about what those runs look like as we narrow in on that time.”
Indiana Senate sends finalized local property, income tax plan to governor

The property tax legislation already sign by the governor also created an exception to allow certain new depreciable personal property placed in service after Jan. 1 to avoid the 30% minimum depreciation floor. The trailer bill walked that language back “if property tax revenue that is attributable to the depreciable personal property is pledged as payment for bonds ,leases, or other obligations.”
Under House Enrolled Act 1427, the agricultural base rate in Senate Enrolled Act 1 additionally will not apply for the January 2025 assessment date for land that is considered “inventory.”
Another part of the legislation deals with disabled veterans. Although Senate Enrolled Act 1 repealed traditional property tax deductions for veterans and replaced them with local credits, trailer language repeals those new local credits and reinstates the traditional veteran deductions that existed previously.
Huston maintained early Friday that post-passage changes to Senate Enrolled Act 1 weren’t the result of a rushed legislative process on property tax reforms.
“One of the reasons we wanted to move (Senate Enrolled Act 1) was to continue to get that feedback — and we’re glad we got the feedback around the business personal property tax. We still have the long-term vision of it. We just want to make sure in those areas where it’s being bonded against, those bonds are protected,” he said. “And then on the veterans credit, I think there’s a little miscommunication with what the policy is, and with the veterans organizations. We want to make sure we’re listening to their concerns and adjust to it, and we’ll have that conversation again next year. I imagine it was probably not the last time we’ll talk about that topic.”
But Senate Democrat leader Sen. Shelli Yoder, of Bloomington, said additions in House Enrolled Act 1427 were needed, in part, because lawmakers moved too quickly before the state’s April budget forecast was released.
“The Senate Democrat caucus has been saying to slow down. Let’s make sure we get this right. Let’s not get to a place, especially when we’ve had real concerns. But when we got that budget forecast — and all of a sudden, we’re having to do some serious back-stepping — no, this was no surprise,” she said.
“What we did quickly see is sort of wide-eyed like, ‘Oh gosh, what did we do? How are we going to fix this, and maybe slow down the rollout?'” Yoder added, referring to Senate Enrolled Act 1. “But again, no matter you know how you spin it, it was kind of a bait and switch. It was a shell game for Hoosiers. You know, here’s property tax relief that never really came as relief.”
 What about health care?

After years of targeting Indiana’s health care prices, Indiana lawmakers started the session by introducing several comprehensive reforms — but where did they end?
Many new laws will follow in the footsteps of their predecessors by requiring more reporting and transparency. Whether it’s the 340B drug program, the average cost of hospital services or disclosing ownership ties, health care providers across the spectrum will have more paperwork in their future. 
One of the biggest packages was reversed after the initial effort was criticized for setting “price caps” on five nonprofit hospital systems. Violators would lose their tax-exempt status with the state. 
Now, such a move wouldn’t occur until 2029 at the earliest, following a state-sponsored study to determine average prices. Numerous studies have already done such analysis only to be dismissed for being slanted to one side of the debate or another. Authors hope that having a state agency perform the calculations will bring clarity. 
 
A long-sought tax: 
For years, health care advocates have sought an increase to the state’s cigarette tax, notching a win this session after a grim financial forecast. Cigarettes will now be $2 more expensive, with proportional increases for other forms of tobacco. 
“We have to have a healthier Indiana. We have to have people that are healthier,” said House Speaker Todd Huston about the tax increase. “This is something that I think will have long, long-term impacts for helping people make positive choices.”


One particular disappointment for health advocates was the decision to slash funding for local public health departments from $100 million annually to $40 million. 
“Indiana has had abysmal health care rankings over the years … that was the whole idea of finally putting some money behind doing something,” said House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta. “ Now just to basically take the rug out is, I think, just not the way to go.”
But Bray rejected the notion that such a cut undid that previous work. 
“Absolutely, unequivocally, no,” he said. “If you look across the counties of the state, there was about 45% of those funds that went unspent. Not because they weren’t using it correctly or anything, but because they were … rolling out program and trying to develop them.
“Everybody’s left this budget wanting a little bit more,” he continued. “But this still continues to fund public health projects. And it is our hope that in a couple years, we’ll be able to fund that at a stronger level.”
Another big strike to the state’s overall health: curbing enrollment on Indiana’s Medicaid expansion program. The Healthy Indiana Plan serves low- to moderate-income Hoosiers and, like similar programs across the country, has increased access to preventative care services and decreased emergency department visits — though such progress could be derailed if a significant number of Hoosiers lose their health care coverage. 
Gov. Mike Braun indicated his support for many of the measures above, naming health care as one of his core targets ahead of the 2025 session.  But he said that there was more work to be done.
“I think we got a good start on it,” Braun told reporters on Thursday. “I think health care will be a big agenda item for next year.”

(Getty Images)April is National Reentry Month — a time to reflect on what it truly takes for someone to come home, rebuild their life, and thrive. Much attention has been given to immediate needs like employment and housing. But even beyond these basic services, the road to reintegration demands something deeper: attention to mental health and the space for personal healing.
I grew up in Louisiana, where digging in the dumpster for food wasn’t just a phrase — it was my reality. Watching my mother work miracles with what little we had shaped my worldview. From those beginnings through military service, a PhD at NYU, and medical school at Tulane, I’ve learned a powerful truth: transformation begins when opportunity meets mental resilience.
Now, as a Triple Board Resident specializing in Pediatrics, General Psychiatry, and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry — and as the leader of the Inner Words: Empowering Justice-Involved Individuals Through Identity-Based Mental Health Therapeutic Conversations program — I see daily how mental health support can rewrite futures. From juvenile detention centers to adult facilities across Indiana, we’re witnessing something powerful: when people are given the tools to understand their emotions and build resilience, they begin to reclaim control over their lives.
The evidence of transformation is clear. During our five-week program, we’ve seen individuals — some facing serious charges — develop emotional regulation skills and new perspectives on conflict resolution.
FSSA launches pilot mental health program in jails

One young girl, once quick to fight when tensions rose, had a moment of clarity. She said, “I used to fight other people because I had an issue with someone, but now I’m thinking, why do I do that? There’s no need for me to fight anyone anymore.” Her words are a testament to a simple truth: when young people are taught to pause and reflect, they discover new paths forward.
This transformation isn’t accidental. It results from creating psychological safety, encouraging deeper reflection, and establishing community guidelines—ones that include the grace to mess up, the introspection to apologize, and the respect to hear each other out. We teach that emotions like anger are normal. What matters is how we choose to respond.
Justice-involved individuals are no different from others in their potential, but the difference in their lived experiences is often stark. Many come from environments lacking access to healthy food, quality education, and safe spaces. The path to reducing recidivism must address these root causes while also building mental resilience.
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s Road to Reentry program has stepped forward to support this vital work. Their investment allows us to expand Inner Words Empower to three adult correctional facilities in Indiana — Heritage Trail, Pendleton, and Plainfield — while continuing year-round sessions at the Public Advocates in Community re-Entry (PACE) Center.
Anthem also partners with organizations like Thomas Ridley’s 1 Like Me, which helps remove practical barriers to reentry, such as driver’s license reinstatement. Their Hope Hustler Outreach Program has helped more than 2,000 individuals regain their licenses removing this significant barrier to employment and independence.
These partnerships and investments recognize that successful reentry requires a comprehensive approach—meeting practical needs while nurturing mental health and personal development. This hope isn’t naive optimism—it’s grounded in evidence that trauma-informed, cognitively focused interventions work. By combining support services with emotional resilience building, we’re creating a framework for lasting change.
Whether it’s a young person in detention, an adult navigating Department of Correction systems, or someone rebuilding their life through reentry support at PACE, each story of transformation ripples outward. Each success brings us one step closer to a compassionate and just society we all deserve.

A few weeks after the birth, the two were temporarily separated. Hailey poses for a portrait after being temporarily reunited with her daughter on April 1 in Cuba. Asked what she misses most, Hailey replied: “Her smiling” (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).CUBA, Mo. — Hailey cradled her cat like a baby and nuzzled his fur. It wasn’t long before he rejected the attention and leapt from her arms in the callous way cats do. She cursed him in the way hormonal teenagers do.
Ash, a gray stray Hailey took in against her great-aunt’s protesting, became the teen’s comfort through a pregnancy and postpartum that spanned 10 foster homes, hospitals and group homes across Missouri. 
Hailey entered the state foster system at 2 years old. She’s lost count of how many roofs she’s slept under. 
Last spring at 15 years old, Hailey learned she was pregnant.
When she asked the state for an abortion, Hailey was told the possibility wasn’t up for discussion. By the time her stomach started to bulge, Missourians voted to codify the right to abortion in the state Constitution, and Hailey decided she wanted to parent. 
But it wasn’t so simple. 
By then, Hailey was staying with her great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, but the state remained her legal guardian. Though Hailey took initiative to prepare for motherhood, caseworkers on several occasions during her pregnancy threatened to take the baby after she was born, rolling out examples from Hailey’s long history in the state’s care.
In late February, just a few weeks after Hailey turned 16, her daughter was born. The resemblance is unmistakable: vibrant red locks, pale skin and blue eyes. 
From the moment her baby girl entered the world, Hailey feared the state would take her. While that hasn’t happened permanently, the state did temporarily separate the young mother and child, moving them to different cities in different corners of the state. 
By eight weeks postpartum, Hailey had slept in two hospitals and four homes. 
Desperate to reunite her child with family as she was shuffled around the foster system, Hailey signed power of attorney of her daughter over to Spradley, to whom she also wanted to return.
In early April, after months of protesting the state’s push to move her into a faith-based maternity home, Hailey acquiesced. It allowed her to reunite with her daughter. 
A few weeks later, on the eve of a court hearing to discuss her permanent placement, Hailey ran away from the maternity home with her 6-week-old in her arms. Both were quickly found and returned to state custody. 
Hailey said she fled, in part, out of fear the state would officially declare she couldn’t live with Spradley. And she was terrified about where they might send her next. 
The family’s fate remains uncertain.










As a teen in such a vulnerable situation, she deserved to be held and surrounded by care, and instead, she was placed in this really precarious, uncertain situation.


– Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You


Missouri has long been one of the most anti-abortion states in the country, with elected officials and advocates preaching the virtue of supporting young mothers to ensure abortion isn’t their only option. 
But Hailey said this sentiment is a far cry from her experience. To her, it felt like the state first made the decision to continue the pregnancy for her, then actively worked to keep her from parenting her child. 
The Independent spent months following Hailey and reviewing communications between her, Spradley, their advocates and the state that spanned Hailey’s pregnancy and postpartum. 
The record of her struggles in the system illustrate what youth advocates and foster care experts say are repeated failures by the state to support Hailey, and later her daughter. 
“Hailey was saying she wanted to parent, so she should have been supported,” said Laura Sullivan, a licensed independent social worker in Ohio who has spent several months advocating for Hailey. “In these states where they’re forcing pregnancies, especially teen pregnancies, they have to be ready to help these moms to parent.”
A spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Social Services, which oversees the state foster care system, said she could not discuss the specifics of Hailey’s case, instead pointing to Missouri’s Child Welfare Manual.
 ‘Don’t get pregnant’

The Facebook message came from a stranger. 
“I have a child on my caseload who I believe is a relative to you,” an employee with a Missouri foster care agency wrote the morning of May 21, 2024. 
Within hours, the state cleared and authorized Spradley to take her niece in under a temporary arrangement. Hailey was on her doorstep by that evening.
A letter dated that same day stated that while Hailey remained in the custody of Children’s Division, she was being placed with Spradley for an “indeterminate period.” 
Though filled with gaps, the aunt and niece have a long history. Spradley used to take Hailey to the St. Louis Zoo, propping her up against the wooden railings to catch a glimpse of the animals. As Hailey got older, Spradley would take her driving around different corners of southeast Missouri to get ice cream or go to a park. 
At times they went years without seeing one another. Though another great-aunt of Hailey’s — Spradley’s sister — adopted Hailey when she was 4, Hailey spent much of her childhood shuffled between different foster homes and mental hospitals. 
 Hailey doesn’t remember her mother well, but she holds on to photos of them together in the first few years of Hailey’s life, before her mother died when she was 4 years old (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
She was a flight risk almost everywhere she went until she landed at Spradley’s.
“Don’t get pregnant,” Hailey recalled Spradley telling her when she moved in. 
A few weeks later, Hailey went to the doctor to confirm what she feared. Hailey, who only a few months earlier had turned 15, was pregnant. 
She wanted an abortion in the beginning. When Hailey asked her case worker if it was possible, she was told the state wasn’t allowed to discuss it with her. Abortion at the time remained illegal in Missouri with limited exceptions for medical emergencies.
Hailey couldn’t get up the nerve to tell Spradley she was pregnant, so she made a friend break the news instead. But Spradley didn’t kick her out. She doubled down on her desire to help.
Spradley searched the internet for answers. She sent a note to JustChoice — an agency based out of Ohio that helps people create abortion, adoption or parenting plans — saying her niece had been denied an abortion and now wanted to raise her child.
There was just one problem, Spradley said: Though months from her due date, the state was already threatening to take away Hailey’s baby. 
 ‘We’re going to remove that baby’

Sullivan, the licensed independent social worker at JustChoice, reached out to Spradley after her organization received her message in late 2024. With Spradley’s permission, she started communicating with Hailey’s case worker to talk about a parenting plan.
Sullivan recalls the case worker in their initial calls telling her: “I don’t think Hailey’s going to be able to parent. We’re going to remove that baby. Her and her aunt, this is not a stable situation; they have a long history with the agency.’” 
Most urgent, the case worker told Sullivan, was Spradley’s lack of adequate housing. If she wanted to maintain custody of Hailey through her pregnancy, she needed somewhere else to live. 
After staying with a friend in St. Louis, Spradley and Hailey moved into the home and church of a former pastor in Wright City. Some of Spradley’s friends had pointed them to the old building off a rural highway as emergency accommodations.
The house, which abutted woods and farmland, sat untouched after the pastor died months earlier.
In the main room, religious relics crowded the wall. Behind one closed door was what Hailey dubbed the “porn room,” after they found explicit images on an abandoned computer. Hailey slept upstairs beneath old posters of semi trucks plastered to the walls. 
The lack of heat became a growing concern as winter approached.

The state began talking of removing Hailey from Spradley’s care; a faith-based maternity home in the St. Louis suburbs that contracts with the state was suggested. Hailey remained adamant she didn’t want to go. When her case worker recommended she have bags packed and by the door the week of Christmas, she listened. 
But she also shut down, growing moodier as the looming threat of removal hung over the holidays.
The new year came and went. Hailey’s bags remained by the door. The state never stopped by.
Sullivan, searching for a solution, teamed up with Right By You, an “all options” nonprofit focused on helping pregnant youth, to raise money for Spradley to rent an upgraded apartment.
Within weeks, Right By You raised $5,000 — primarily through Missouri donors and abortion funds — to cover Spradley’s rent through May. Meanwhile, Sullivan worked the phones with Spradley, calling landlords in an attempt to find someone who would accept a pregnant teen, a 52-year-old on disability, two dogs and one cat.
She found a solution in Cuba, a town about 80 miles southwest of St. Louis. 
By mid-January, Hailey and Spradley were moved into a small, unadorned two-bedroom apartment.
Spradley reached out to her network of friends, asking if they could help furnish the apartment with baby essentials as a birthday surprise for Hailey, who turned 16 in late January. 
They came by the truck-load, dropping off strollers, onesies and a swing. Spradley used some of the disability back-pay she received to splurge on a crib and a bottle sanitizer.
In the end, it still wasn’t enough. 
 ‘Where are you going to live?’

Spradley didn’t take Hailey in sooner for many reasons. Poverty and poor health were the most prevailing. 
“So what’s your plan for where you are going to live?” Hailey’s case worker asked in a text to Spradley months earlier, shortly after Hailey learned she was pregnant. “Do you have any money saved?”
“I had absolutely no income when Hailey was brought to me,” Spradley replied. “Not a dime. I get SSI disability which is very little.” 
But once together, Hailey didn’t want to leave. Finally, someone understood her — a sarcastic and brash teen with a tendency to raise her voice.
“Some people would see what she’s doing and would freak out, but they don’t understand what she’s grown up and what she’s went through,” Spradley said. “That’s why I don’t judge her on that. That’s the big difference between me and other people.”
Unlike a foster parent, Spradley didn’t receive consistent financial benefits from the state for taking Hailey in. Though she attempted on several occasions to get certified as a foster parent through the state, she never received the final approval. 
Spradley suspects it’s because she’s poor and sick. 
She’s often seized by anxiety, which she said has only worsened since beginning to navigate the state’s hurdles in her attempts to help Hailey. She suffers from agoraphobia, Crohn’s disease, heart conditions and often uses a walker. 
Spradley attributed some of her ailments to growing up in Times Beach, Missouri. It’s now a ghost town, beset by a chemical contamination that came to light in the 1980s. The Environmental Protection Agency deemed it “one of the worst environmental disasters in our nation’s history.”
 Hailey holds up infant clothes to show her great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, on Jan. 28, 2025, at their apartment in Cuba (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Hailey is as determined as her aunt. 
She enrolled in teen parenting classes through Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis as she started her second trimester. Between that and her prenatal appointments, she made weekly trips to St. Louis through her third trimester. 
Most weeks, she made the trip without Spradley, booking and boarding a van through MO HealthNet, the state’s Medicaid program. The vehicle usually picked up other patients along the way, stretching what was normally a 90-minute drive into multiple hours. 
The state on several occasions expressed concern with this arrangement, telling both Spradley and Sullivan that Hailey needed constant supervision. 
Instead, Spradley kept an eye on Hailey’s location from an app on her cell phone.
Every year, Missouri social services agencies seize millions of dollars in Social Security benefits from foster children. Hailey is among them. 
When Sullivan questioned how the state was using Hailey’s payments, which typically go toward funding foster care, she was told it was being used to pay for Medicaid expenses and the van rides.
She remains skeptical. That $400 a month could have gone a long way to help Spradley purchase furniture and buy groceries, both of which she said were held against her toward the end of Hailey’s pregnancy.
 Birth, ‘then I was out’

Days before Hailey went into labor, the state followed through on its threat. 
Hailey was removed from Spradley’s apartment in Cuba and sent to a private foster home near St. Louis. 
The foster mother, a stranger, drove her to the hospital. Once settled into a room, Hailey said the foster parent told her she was running down to the cafeteria.
Instead, she left Hailey at the hospital and never returned.
Hailey’s daughter was born two days later, on Feb. 26. The moment of joy was brief; within minutes, Hailey lost consciousness. 
“I had a whole asthma attack, then I ended up throwing up everything in my stomach, and then shaking so bad that my jaw was hurting,” she said. “Then I was out.” 
It took two blood transfusions to stem her postpartum hemorrhage.
Hailey ultimately stayed in the hospital for 12 days. Not because of her health, she said, but because the state didn’t know where else to send her.
This isn’t uncommon. In 2024, there were 314 Missouri foster children residing in hospitals. Others were held in hotels, offices and out-of-state residential treatment facilities. 
 Hailey carries her daughter into her great-aunt Jodi Spradley’s apartment on April 1 in Cuba during a day-long visit while Hailey was staying at a group home in southeast Missouri (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
While at the hospital, Hailey learned how to breastfeed. She believes her daughter shares her own lactose intolerance since she doesn’t take well to most formulas.
In many ways the two girls resemble Hailey’s mother, who was found dead in 2011, two years after Hailey had been removed from her custody. She was in the third trimester of pregnancy with a second daughter, who didn’t survive. The autopsy concluded a drug overdose. Spradley still believes it was something more nefarious.
A few months before Hailey gave birth, she asked Spradley if she could see the place where her mom died. They drove 60 miles to the apartment and asked the current tenant if they could look around. Hailey asked lots of questions. Spradley hoped it was healing.
She tries to tell Hailey stories of her mother often. Like the time Hailey’s mother, while pregnant with her, found a free mini fridge at a scrap sale and walked miles home with it. She later did the same with a kiddie pool.
Hailey doesn’t know her father. She hopes her daughter won’t, either.
The line for “father” on the birth certificate is blank, as Hailey intended. 
She says little about the 20-year-old other than that they first met at a foster home years earlier, that he beat her and that he was, for a time, homeless. 
Multiple warrants are out for his arrest, including for failure to appear in court on trespassing and theft charges.
Throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, one of Spradley’s closest friends, Brandie Coleman, was among her fiercest defenders. When Hailey gave birth, Coleman was by her side, Facetiming with Spradley, who feared the state might punish her for being there. 
As Hailey recovered from her hemorrhage, Coleman says a hospital social worker confided in her that a state case worker had been trying to convince her to report Hailey to child protective services so they could remove her baby. But Coleman says the hospital employee refused, not seeing any evidence of abuse or neglect. 
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, the Missouri-based reproductive rights group that helped fundraise for Hailey and Spradley, said the family’s self-advocacy was admirable. 
And in a way, she believes, they were punished for it.
She called Hailey’s case “such a blatant example of a pregnancy literally forced by the state, and then a very clear bias against this person and this notion that her child would be better off with a different family, and she was told that explicitly. And I just honestly was a little bit surprised how unveiled that was. There wasn’t really any pretense about it.” 
 Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, called Hailey a “forceful self advocate,” adding: “It’s really admirable for someone so young, who’s in such a disempowered situation” (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Kraft Sheley, who is also an attorney, said the fact that Hailey had a family member who wanted to take her in — who understood her — was huge. That Hailey was deprived of that support in the days leading up to and after her labor was “such inhumanity.”
“For any person to lose their home and be ripped away from their loved one within three days, four days of giving birth, one of the most formative, transformational experiences of a person’s life, she was treated with such a lack of care,” Kraft Sheley said. “… As a teen in such a vulnerable situation, she deserved to be held and surrounded by care, and instead, she was placed in this really precarious, uncertain situation.”
 Postpartum ‘disrupted’

When Hailey was finally discharged from the hospital, she and her baby were driven 200 miles southwest to Springfield. 
There, they were placed in a private foster home with other teen moms.
Less than a week later, Hailey called Spradley. She was being taken to a mental health hospital to be screened for postpartum depression. Hailey said she was told it was because the foster parent heard her yelling; Hailey said she was yelling at a friend on the phone, not at her baby.
“I never heard this kid cry like she did,” Spradley said of Hailey during the phone call. 
Her daughter was napping when they took Hailey away.
At the hospital, Hailey said she didn’t screen positive for postpartum depression but was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, meaning she has stronger emotional or behavioral responses to stress and trauma. 
Hailey said when she learned she was being admitted to the hospital without her daughter, she had to be sedated after she started “throwing hands” at staff. She remained there for six days. 
Spradley had little contact with Hailey in the hospital once her phone was taken away. When Hailey was released, she signed power of attorney for her daughter over to Spradley. 
As Spradley drove to pick up Hailey’s child, Hailey was taken to yet another location — this time a group home in southeast Missouri.
Hailey believes the separation from her daughter was intentional. Within the first month of her child’s life, the two had been apart nearly as much as they’d been together. 
She tried to continue pumping breast milk. At the start of her third trimester, Hailey had already started collecting small bottles of colostrum. But it didn’t take long after being separated from her daughter for her milk supply to diminish. 
 Hailey feeds her daughter while visiting her great-aunt Jodi Spradley on April 1 in Cuba (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
“For a teen mom, especially one with attachment issues like Hailey has, to be able to breastfeed successfully, that is beautiful and amazing, and could have been really healing,” Sullivan said. “But it was disrupted. So that caused both Hailey harm and (her daughter) harm.” 
Sullivan, who has also worked as a social worker in two states, said it’s easy to use a teen’s years-long history in the system against them unfairly. She doesn’t believe Missouri ever gave Hailey a fair chance. 
“Instead of being like, ‘This is a kid who we know has a lot of trauma and a lot of stuff, we should probably try to figure out how we’re going to help her parent and heal so she can be a good parent,’” Sullivan said. “‘It was just, ‘We’re on a mission to make her not be able to parent.’”
 ‘I’m not giving up on you’

On a sunny day in early April, Hailey returned to her aunt’s home in Cuba.
For the second time in a week, she held her daughter, who was one day shy of 5 weeks old.  
Hailey’s milk supply had mostly dried up. She considered attempting to breastfeed, but then opted to make a bottle instead. 
“Has she given you all the stink face yet?” Hailey asked as Spradley confirmed with a chuckle. 
“Good. That’s my child,” Hailey replied, smiling down at her daughter as she fed her.
She sat in her old room again, across from stickers adhered to the wall welcoming her baby home. She urged the dogs to be careful as they investigated her baby’s scent. She cuddled her cat.
It was all temporary.

Hailey was back for just part of the day on an authorized off-site visit. A few hours later, Spradley would drive her 90 minutes back to the group home where Hailey would again kiss her baby goodbye.
Until then, she changed diapers, went through paperwork and sorted baby clothes, a sense of normalcy in a life that had been anything but.
As Hailey lounged on the couch with her daughter and Spradley rocked her small dog, named Baby, in the corner, Spradley’s cell phone rang. At the sight of the caller ID, an old friend of Spradley’s, Hailey perked up and grabbed for the phone to say hello.  
“You know what? I love the sound of your voice right now. You sound so happy,” Spradley’s friend said to Hailey before pausing. “Honestly, are you doing OK?” 
“Not for good, sadly,” Hailey said. “Jodi kidnapped me for the day though.” 
She outlined her plan to return permanently to her daughter. The first step was the maternity home she initially resisted. It was her only option she saw to parent.
Less than a week later she checked into the St. Louis area facility. Spradley met her in the lobby with the baby. 
The past several months have been hard on Spradley. Anxiety attacks bare themselves in the middle of the night. She worries over Hailey and her daughter. She worries over herself. When she first took in Hailey, there were days she wondered if the stress was too much and if she should send Hailey away. But now, the house feels devastatingly empty without her. 
When Hailey was 11 weeks pregnant, she snuck Ash, the cat, into the house against Spradley’s wishes. At the time it infuriated Spradley, who was already having a difficult time feeding two humans and two dogs, making frequent trips to the food pantry. Then she saw how much comfort the cat brought Hailey as she faced an unknown future.
When Hailey was taken away, Spradley started letting the cat sleep beside her at night. 
Over the years, Hailey ran from multiple family members and foster homes.
But she never ran from Spradley. It’s something Hailey’s social worker pointed out to Spradley in messages throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, and something Spradley continues to emphasize in her fight to bring Hailey and her daughter back under her roof. 
 Jodi Spradley holds Hailey’s cat, Ash, on April 1 at her apartment in Cuba (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
It’s why Spradley wasn’t shocked when she learned at Hailey’s most recent placement hearing in mid-April that she had run away from the maternity home just hours earlier. 
“I don’t believe what the system is doing to her… She is a child that’s been in that system for so long that they broke her,” Spradley said the next day, after police located Hailey and her daughter about 130 miles east, in south-central Illinois.
“Sometimes she makes me so mad,” Spradley continued, “but I just can’t blame her for what they did to her. I blame them. I blame the system.”
After Hailey and her daughter were located by the state, they were moved to another foster home, just outside St. Louis. 
A few days later, Hailey said her case worker showed up with police, insisting her daughter was underweight and needed to be evaluated at the hospital. Spradley rushed to St. Louis Children’s Hospital to meet them. There, she said doctors gave the baby a clean bill of health and noted she gained weight since the week prior.
Then on Friday, hours after the Missouri Department of Social Services responded to a request for comment on Hailey’s case from The Independent, her case worker called Spradley. The state would soon allow Hailey and her daughter to return to Spradley’s care, at least until a court made a more permanent placement decision, Spradley said.
Despite the sudden good news, nothing about the family’s situation is set in stone.
“I’m scared about what tomorrow’s going to bring,” Spradley said Sunday.
She often reflects on words she spoke to Hailey’s mother not long before she died. Hailey was in a private foster home at the time. 
“I promise you I’m going to bring Hailey home,” she said more than a decade ago.
It’s why Spradley didn’t hesitate when Hailey reached out for help. Though when asked about that decision, Hailey, who doesn’t tend toward sentimentality, said, “I knew she’d take my dumb ass.”
She flipped Spradley the bird. Spradley mirrored the motion. 
“Me and Hailey, our relationship, even when she has hardships, I’m like, ‘I’m not letting you go,’” Spradley said. “I’m not giving up on you.”
It’s why Hailey chose Spradley to help raise her daughter. 
She’s adamant her daughter won’t end up in the state’s care the way she did. 
“What they’re doing is f**ked,” Hailey said of her lifetime spent in the foster system. 
Spradley is ready to fight right there alongside her niece. 
“We want her to experience an actual caring family and have support rather than toss you aside whenever they can’t handle you,” Spradley said. “If they can’t handle you at your worst, then they don’t deserve you at your best, right?”

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)A federal appeals court this week will finally hear the state’s appeal of a 2023 ruling that struck down a New Jersey law barring private companies from detaining immigrants.
Thursday’s hearing in front of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia comes as the Trump administration carries out its mass deportation plan and prepares to open what will be the east coast’s largest immigration detention center in Newark.
Since Trump took office for his second term in January, roughly 23,000 people have been deported, according to NBC News.
In 2021, Gov. Phil Murphy signed a law that barred public and private entities from entering contracts to house immigrant detainees. The move came after years of protests by immigrant advocates who called on Democratic leaders in Bergen, Essex, and Hudson counties to sever their contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which housed immigrant detainees in those counties’ jails.
CoreCivic filed a lawsuit challenging New Jersey’s law in February 2023. The company, which runs the Elizabeth Detention Center, which holds about 300 immigrant detainees, claimed the law unconstitutionally encroached on the federal government’s power. The Biden administration sided with CoreCivic, saying the law would be “catastrophic” to federal immigration efforts.
U.S. District Judge Robert Kirsch ruled partially against New Jersey, saying it can bar public entities from detaining immigrants but has no power to stop the federal government from entering contracts with private firms to house immigrant detainees. Attorneys for New Jersey appealed to the 3rd Circuit.
As the state waited for the federal panel to hear its appeal, President Donald Trump won reelection to the White House and began carrying out his mass deportation plan.
In February, private company Geo Group formally announced its plan to open a 1,000-bed immigrant detention jail in a Newark facility called Delaney Hall. The plans have faced opposition from immigrant advocates and some public officials (the city of Newark has gone to court in an attempt to halt or postpone its opening).
In March, the state Attorney General’s Office asked the 3rd Circuit to finally hear the state’s appeal, stressing that while the appeal is active, the state cannot enforce the 2021 law as it pertains to private companies. The hearing is scheduled for May 1 at 9:30 a.m.
Spokespeople for the Attorney General’s Office and for Geo Group and CoreCivic did not respond to requests for comment.

The legislature fought for years over proposals to expand eligibility for Medicaid, the public health program financed by states and the federal government. Expansion was the subject of some of the legislature’s loudest shouting matches in the years following the 2010 passage of the federal Affordable Care Act.
Missourians finally got tired of watching other states extend health insurance to low-income residents and boast of economic benefits and better health outcomes. They went to the ballot in 2020 and got the job done with a constitutional amendment.
Cue the recriminations. All over again. 
After years of gaining public acceptance, Medicaid funding is now endangered in the U.S. Congress, where Republicans are under pressure to find big pots of money to raid in order to pay for President Donald Trump’s tax cut package.
Federal Medicaid cuts could leave Missouri with huge budget shortfall

Medicaid is a huge pot of money. And Republicans are eyeing the portion that is used to compensate the 40 states that took advantage of an Obamacare provision to expand eligibility guidelines for low-income adults. 
The federal government currently pays 90% of the expansion costs. 
Should Congress claw back that money, states in total stand to lose about $600 billion over a decade’s time, according to a recent analysis. 
Cuts like that would force all states into difficult corners. But Missouri’s situation would be genuinely strange.
Because, after all of those years spent resisting Medicaid expansion, Missouri now is unable to get rid of it.
At least not easily.
With their bickering and inaction, legislators in Missouri forfeited the chance to enact Medicaid expansion by statute, which could be amended or even repealed if the occasion demanded. 
Instead, advocates expanded Medicaid eligibility by amending the state Constitution. Their work can only be undone by passing another amendment, which would be a long, acrimonious process.
And so, for the time being, Missouri would be forced to provide coverage to working-age, low-income adults, even if the federal match shrinks or disappears.
“So you will see cuts in other places,” said Bridgett McCandless, a retired physician who ran a health clinic for uninsured patients and served as CEO of the Health Forward Foundation, which focuses on expanding healthcare access.
“The three groups that are at the greatest risk are pregnant women, children and seniors with disabilities, primarily in nursing homes,” she said. “All that will have profound generational effects.”
Other cuts that wouldn’t violate the constitutional amendment could be reimbursement costs for providers, dental care, mental health and substance use treatment and home health care. Missouri may also be forced to look at cuts outside of its Medicaid program.
Somewhere out there, a class of term-limited Republican Missouri lawmakers nods sagely and says, “told you so.”
Indeed, certain legislators did warn that the state would be on the hook if a capricious future Congress reneged on its commitment to the Medicaid expansion match. It was the most solid argument against broadening the program — much less tedious than the insinuations that the low-income Missourians who stood to gain health insurance were freeloaders and grifters.
Then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat who wanted to expand Medicaid, proposed including a safety valve in state law: If federal funding was ever cut, Missouri would roll back the expansion. 
But no law was passed, and so no safety valve. We are left to argue about whether that is good or bad.
For now, the prevailing strategy seems to be to hope we don’t have to find out.  
U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has turned heads by declaring that he won’t support outright cuts to Medicaid, though he does favor work requirements, which would force some people out of the program.
Hawley, a former Republican Missouri attorney general, has spent all of his political career opposing Obamacare, which includes Medicaid expansion.
What swayed him, he said, was the vote on the constitutional amendment, which was 53% in favor and 46% opposed. Many supporters found that a bit close for comfort, but in an interview with RollCall, a Washington outlet, Hawley called it “a big margin.” He also said he expected Trump to oppose cuts to Medicaid.
Whether that will happen, or whether Hawley will stick to his opposition, is anyone’s guess.
What’s certain is that about 1.3 million Missourians use Medicaid or the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program. That’s about one-fifth of the state’s population. 
Of that number, about 300,000 adults have gained access to health insurance since voter-mandated expansion took effect in 2021. Medicaid has enabled them to get annual checkups, be treated for chronic conditions and undergo long-delayed surgical procedures like joint replacements.
“Once you’re on it, it works beautifully,” McCandless said.
This is the outcome that opponents most feared in the long, bitter expansion debate — that once passed, Medicaid expansion would be impossible to get rid of. 
Turns out, they may be right. Even an act of Congress may not be enough to shut it down.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_mocapitol1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-28 07:05:32.612611

(Ron Cogswell | used by permission of the photographer)With the 100th day of President Donald Trump’s second term in office approaching, University of Wisconsin-Madison professors and staff met Thursday to take stock of the growing threats to higher education and U.S. democracy and to discuss collective action to push back. 
UW-Madison professor Mark Copelevitch said the threats to higher education are “unprecedented because it’s happening in America” yet compared the current moment to a movie that historians and experts have seen “over and over again.” 
  Mark Copelovitch
Copelovitch described the current U.S. system of government as competitive authoritarianism. He said comparisons for what is happening today don’t have to go back to 1930s Germany — recent examples are  Viktor Orban in Hungary and Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey. 
“Universities are centers of independent ideas and dissent. Professors are attacked by populist and nationalist leaders as being the radical elite,” Copelovitch said.
University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty, including Copelovitch and other professors were gathered for panels organized by the Public Representation Organization of the Faculty Senate (PROFS) and the Academic Staff Professionals Representation Organization (ASPRO) to discuss shared challenges and the prospects for collective action to defend higher education.
UW-Madison is facing an array of challenges to its operations due to the federal government as over $12 million in research grants to UW-Madison have been cut and caps on indirect cost reimbursements for research grants at 15% represent another significant cut to research funds, and dozens of students across UW campuses and other schools had their visas cancelled. Copelovitch said it is part of a greater attempt to exert influence over the shape of universities across the country.
“What’s happening at Madison [is] terrible and horrible and has real world consequences specifically here,” Copelovitch said. “But again, it is part of a broader pattern that is affecting all the universities across the country. So far, most universities have treated the problems as institution-specific symptoms… That is the big challenge right now. How do you get dozens, if not hundreds of institutions, to start acting collectively to push back against this?”
The panelists said one of the big challenges that universities face is explaining to the public how their budgets work and the impacts of potential cuts.
UW-Madison Veterinary Medicine Research Administration Director Jenny Dahlberg said one lost grant will be “much more broad reaching” than some imagine. “This is an entire generation of scientists that no longer will have opportunities to conduct research. That is alarming,” she said. 
Dahlberg said faculty and staff need to find a way to protect their ability to speak freely about research and to train the next generation. 
Copelovitch said universities will have to communicate to the public about their budgets and recent attacks on academic freedom, and explain that if those things continue it “ultimately means that the universities that people think they’re going to send their kids to eventually are just not going to exist in that format.”
Don Moynihan, a University of Michigan professor and previously a UW-Madison faculty member, said conversations about whether universities are too reliant on federal funding miss the point. He said that investments into research at universities were part of a deal between universities and the government created at the end of World War II. 
“If you will help us with our goals of building out research infrastructure, we will ensure a steady flow of resources into that research infrastructure,” Moynihan said. “Now, we have one of those partners basically withdrawing from the partnership and not just withdrawing from the partnership, but also trying to dictate what the other party does, even though they’re bringing less resources to the table and that activity violated that contract.” 
Moynihan said there’s no way to manage the budget holes that could be created by cuts and that it’s not really feasible that the private sector could fill to gap.
“You’re going to accept or live with a much smaller campus that does much less research…  and that story will be true across lots of other research areas,” Moynihan said. 
Moynihan said the Trump’s administration’s letter to Harvard University, which demanded changes to its administration, student admissions process and called for audits into “DEI” across the campus, lays out a “full menu” of administration priorities. The administration said it would also be cutting over $2 billion in federal grants to the school. 
Moynihan said that it’s clear that individual universities making side deals won’t be a viable strategy. 
“Without collective action, there is not going to be any effective pushback against this administration,” Moynihan said.
Copelovitch said that he has been “heartened” to see the pushback in the last few weeks. UW-Madison Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin signed a letter together with hundreds of other higher education leaders to speak against the “unprecedented government overreach” and the “political interference now endangering American higher education.”  
Copelovitch said discussions about universities banding together, including a recent proposal that  Big Ten schools form a NATO-like agreement, will also be key. 
“No chancellor or provost is going to stick their neck out and lead the fray. Harvard is doing it a little bit, and Harvard can afford to do it, but leaders of any individual public institution are not going to do that, so there’s a need to speak collectively,” Copelovitch said. 
“Fragility” of U.S. democracy
The upheaval in U.S. institutions has gone beyond higher education, and at a separate event, titled “The Fragility and Performance of Democracy in the U.S.” hosted by the Elections Research Center on Thursday afternoon, focused on analyzing Trump’s attacks on the U.S. administrative state and the consolidation of executive power .
UW-Madison professor and director of the Elections Research Center Barry Burden said he didn’t think “any of us imagined we would see the kind of chaos that we’ve experienced these first 100 days,” but said the second Trump administration “has been so massively disruptive” and is “pushing the limits of what a democratic system can handle.” 
“It is doing things that previously seemed illegal, impossible, unimaginable or unconstitutional, and they’re happening daily and often with people who are not really part of the government or part of his party — people like Elon Musk and others — being brought in to do the hatchet work on federal agencies,” Burden said. 
Burden said that Trump is showing warning signs of a “personalized” president, which is often a warning sign for democracies. 
  Barry Burden, political science professor and director of the Elections Research Center at the UW-Madison
“We’ve seen in other countries where a fairly elected leader, and [Trump] is a fairly elected leader, can nonetheless abuse the government against their enemies and make it a kind of weapon — whether it’s using the IRS for political purposes, or threatening judges or intimidating universities or journalists,” Burden said. “All of those things are using his power as president to get parts of society to bow to him and serve his interests.” 
Burden said the protests being held across the country at state Capitols, in small cities and towns — including in Wisconsin — in recent weeks are a sign that civil society is starting to rise up in opposition. 
“We’ve seen the public come back out of its hiding,” Burden said. He added that unpopularity amongst the public and public resistance — along with accountability by the courts and the media — are what has been essential in resisting autocrats in eastern Europe and Latin America as well. “It’s all hands on deck, really, to stop a Democratic government from sliding away.”
Burden said that people need to understand their place in upholding democracy.
“Democracy needs people to keep it flourishing,” Burden said. “It doesn’t operate on its own. We often think of it as a kind of system. You write a constitution, and it exists, and it’s in place, and it will just continue. That’s not how it works. It has to be sustained and tended to and protected. It takes a whole bunch of different actors. It takes the public being vigilant. It takes journalists, media outlets holding government accountable, and transmitting what’s happening. … and it takes political parties to govern themselves and keep bad elements out of government.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma lawsuit coming before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday could produce a landmark ruling on the role of religion in state-funded education.
At the center of the debate is St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, a church-backed online charter school that was approved to open in Oklahoma until the state Supreme Court struck it down in June. It would be the first publicly funded charter school in the nation to adopt a religion.
The case questions whether charter schools, long considered public, are truly an arm of the government and whether states should be able to deny a school access to taxpayer funding because it is religious.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa sought to open the online school to students of all backgrounds and faiths in Oklahoma, especially in rural areas that have no brick-and-mortar Catholic schools. State dollars would be the school’s primary source of funding.
However, St. Isidore would be unapologetically religious, teaching Catholic beliefs, requiring students to attend Mass and operating according to church doctrine. The archbishop of Oklahoma City and the bishop of Tulsa would choose the members of the school’s governing board.
The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board, which has since dropped the word “virtual” from its name, approved St. Isidore in June 2023 to open as a state-funded entity. 
Attorney General Gentner Drummond asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to block the school from opening. The state’s highest court ruled in Drummond’s favor, finding the concept of a religious charter school unconstitutional. 
The matter is now in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, which announced in January it would consider the case. The Court, whose justices have a conservative majority, will hear oral arguments on Wednesday. A decision is expected by the end of June.

Oklahoma’s educational outcomes are too poor to turn down an institution like the Catholic church that has a history of academic success, said Brian Shellem, who leads the Statewide Charter School Board.
National testing showed Oklahoma was among the lowest-performing states in the country in 2024.
In an interview with Oklahoma Voice, Shellem said the state should take an “all-hands-on-deck approach” to give students better options. The statewide board’s objective, he said, is to encourage innovative school models.
“When we have a tornado come through, we don’t ask for someone’s religious beliefs,” Shellem said. “You just hear the chain saws firing up, the wood starts cutting. People come give food and water and shelter. With this crisis of our education, we need everyone to be chipping in. And when someone raises their hand and says, ‘We are willing, and we are able,’ should we say, ‘There’s the door’? Or (do) we say, ‘You obviously have a (strong) track record. Thank you for helping.’”
Introducing religion into public education doesn’t solve Oklahoma’s poor outcomes, said Drummond, the attorney general.
Drummond, who is running for Oklahoma governor, said the Catholic charter school would be “a new, shiny thing” but a distraction from making genuine improvements to reading and math levels. He said it could draw public funds away from existing school districts and hurt their performance.
Gov. Kevin Stitt and the head of Oklahoma’s public schools system, Superintendent Ryan Walters, have advocated for opening St. Isidore to expand educational options in the state. Both filed friend-of-the-court briefs for the U.S. Supreme Court to consider as it weighs its decision.

Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent. Allowing a state-funded charter school to adopt a faith “eviscerates” the state and federal Constitution’s prohibition of government-established religion, he told the state Supreme Court during oral arguments last year.
A ruling in favor of the Catholic school could upend charter programs across the country and open the door to schools adopting faith systems that Oklahomans might find objectionable, Drummond said.
“It’s a recipe for chaos and confusion for millions of charter school students, and that is a tragedy,” he told Oklahoma Voice. “I think it would create a patchwork, truly. You would probably have large states like New York, Colorado, California, discontinuing its charter school program because those states probably won’t tolerate the funding of sectarian education. A ruling against me, the state, would subject religious institutions to state regulations of which they’re typically immune.”
The crux of the case, both sides say, is who creates and controls a charter school. 
A charter school is only established in partnership with the state and is subject to regulations that apply to all public schools, therefore making it inextricably tied to the government and subject to church-state separation, the attorney general said.
Attorneys representing St. Isidore and the statewide board say creation and control of a charter school lie with its independent governing board, not the state. They equated charter schools to private institutions that are paid taxpayer funds to provide public services, like a church-affiliated hospital or construction companies hired to build city roads.

Similarly, charter schools are privately run entities contracted with the state, said Phil Sechler, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, a national conservative Christian legal group representing the statewide board.
Those private entities have a right to religious liberty, he said, so excluding them from public funding is religious discrimination. 
Previous Supreme Court rulings found religious groups cannot be excluded from government grants and school voucher programs. Permitting a religious charter school, though, would set a new precedent.
“The Statewide Charter School Board is treating St. Isidore exactly as the Constitution demands — neutrally,” Sechler said. “It’s not promoting religion. It’s not disfavoring it or being hostile to it.
“St. Isidore is simply trying not to be discriminated against because of its faith.”
Alliance Defending Freedom has been involved in other landmark cases, including the Mississippi lawsuit that resulted in the nation’s highest court overturning Roe v. Wade.
The nonprofit group is representing the Statewide Charter School Board for free, Sechler and Shellem said. Its chief legal counsel, Jim Campbell, will present oral arguments to the Supreme Court.
Michael H. McGinley of Dechert LLP will represent St. Isidore.
The Attorney General’s Office hired Washington, D.C., attorney Gregory Garre to represent Drummond at a cost of $250,000, according to the AG’s contract with Garre’s law firm, Latham & Watkins LLP.
If approved, St. Isidore would be open to students of all backgrounds and faiths, Catholic officials have said. Its contract with the Statewide Charter School Board pledged it would not deny students admission based on their religion, lack of faith, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.
Guiding principles for Oklahoma Catholic schools disagree with the concept of a gender identity that doesn’t match a person’s biological sex, according to guidance the Oklahoma City archdiocese and the Tulsa diocese released in 2021.
However, Catholic schools must ensure “the immeasurable dignity of every child is protected and respected,” the principles state.
All Catholic school students, including those who are LGBTQ+, are treated with human dignity and respect, said Michael Scaperlanda, chancellor of the Oklahoma City archdiocese.

“I think because the Catholic Church believes in the dignity of every human person, we respect the dignity of whoever comes to our school, whoever chooses to come to our school, and respect their freedom to either accept or reject or be curious about the Catholic faith,” Scaperlanda said. “That’s up to them.”
St. Isidore received more than 225 expressions of interest from students wishing to enroll, even with multiple lawsuits hanging over the school, Scaperlanda said. The archdiocese has stated its goal is to enroll up to 500 students in St. Isidore’s first year of operation.
Most of the families expressing interest came from rural areas, and only two attend a Catholic school currently, Scaperlanda said.
The idea for a virtual school had its genesis during the COVID-19 pandemic, Scaperlanda said, when Oklahoma Catholic schools pivoted to online instruction in March 2020. Catholic officials discovered “we could do this sort of education and do it very quickly and very well.”
An online school could make Catholic education available across the state, he said, and as a charter school, it could do so at no cost to families. 
Scaperlanda said Catholic leaders saw other private groups accessing charter school funding and wondered, “Why should we be left out of that?”
“If the state wants to provide these opportunities, it’s discriminatory to say, ‘Chickasaws, you can do this. STEM-minded folks, you can do this. All kinds of other folks can participate in this educational space, but religious groups can’t,’” he said.
It’s no surprise a publicly funded religious school emerged from Oklahoma, considered one of the most predominantly Republican states in the country, said House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City.

In her 15 years in the state Legislature, Munson has seen the GOP supermajority enact a variety of policies inspired by lawmakers’ religious faith — from a near-total abortion ban to a recent House resolution proclaiming “Christ is King.” 
Walters, who leads the Oklahoma State Department of Education, has ordered schools to teach from the Bible and keep a copy of it in every classroom.
Republican lawmakers, afraid of being challenged in a primary election, are “very nervous about standing up and just having real conversations around the separation of church and state,” said Munson, a Democratic candidate for governor.
She said that mindset, along with gerrymandering and straight-party voting, has distanced conservative elected officials from the wishes of Oklahoma voters. Her constituents, despite choosing a private religious education for their children, told her these efforts are “not what we want our government leaders working on.”
“I represent a district that is predominantly Republican and, I would say, religious,” Munson said. “I have Catholics, churches in my district, pretty well-known affluent ones. And they say, ‘This is not what we want in our public schools.’”

(Getty Images)FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — While biodegradable plastics currently account for a half percent of the hundreds of millions of tons of plastic produced annually, a growing demand for the alternative reflects consumer awareness and corporate response.
Researchers from Brazil, Germany and the United States document a multi-faceted global snapshot of the environmental aspects and trends surrounding single-use plastics in a review article titled “Rethinking single-use plastics: Innovations, policies, consumer awareness and market shaping biodegradable plastics in the packaging industry.” The piece was recently published in Trends in Food Science & Technology.
The researchers state that the largest area of application for biodegradable plastic materials is the packaging segment, which accounts for about half of single-use plastic production. The biodegradable packaging market was estimated to reach about $105 billion in 2024 with an expected annual growth rate of about 6 percent between 2024 and 2029, and 44 percent of patents filed worldwide for biodegradable polymers relate to packaging, the study noted.
About 474 million tons of plastics are produced globally each year, and about a third of it is used for packaging, including single-use plastic products for food and beverage containers. Of this, only about 25 percent gets recycled. Plastic production, the article adds, is expected to triple by 2060 following a trend of transitioning from durable plastics to single-use plastics.
Global plastic production increased from 369 million tons in 2016 to 404.5 million tons in 2020, partly due to materials used in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Citing a 2021 study from the same research group in Brazil, the review article noted the pandemic “exacerbated the use of single-use plastic and increased the demand for personal protective equipment and packaging, leading to remarkable growth in the plastics industry and generating more than 8 million tons of waste, mainly affecting Asia, Europe and America.” The same study mentions that the pandemic expanded food packaging due to a shift in eating habits and an increase in online purchases.
Despite the transition to single-use plastics, an increasing number of patents and successful research and development of biodegradable plastic materials has sparked the interest of industries to invest in large-scale production technologies for renewable monomers and polymers, the researchers added.

“There is a lot of opportunity with zein, which is a family of proteins in corn that forms a beautiful film to make biodegradable plastics, and it’s a little bit more expensive, but we hope that will be hitting the market soon as well,” said Sun Ferreira, a co-author of the study and an assistant professor in the food science department for University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture and the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences. Ferreira is part of both the research and extension arms of the Division of Agriculture, the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station and the Cooperative Extension Service.

Ferreira is a food scientist and food processing engineer who has worked with biopolymers for microencapsulation to protect flavors, vitamins and other ingredients during processing, storage and digestion. He collaborated with the study’s lead author, Andreza Salles Barone, a nutritionist and Ph.D. candidate with the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro’s Food and Nutrition Graduate Program.

Barone is supervised by Ana Elizabeth Cavalcante Fai, corresponding author for the review article, a food engineer and associate professor in food science at Rio de Janeiro State University, where she coordinates the Laboratory of Multidisciplinary Practices for Sustainability at the Institute of Nutrition.
“Food packaging plays a vital role in ensuring food safety and quality,” Fai said. “However, it is increasingly unjustifiable to produce short-life cycle packaging using synthetic plastics that persist in the environment for up to 400 years. Even more concerning is the growing awareness that plastics don’t degrade completely — they fragment into micro- and nanoplastics, which are now recognized as widespread environmental pollutants and an emerging public health concern.”
Ferreira said that while biodegradable plastics are a promising long-term alternative solution, it is not where he expects to see the biggest short-term impact on the reduction of overall plastic use.
Fai and Barone said that plastic has undeniably transformed modern life since its mass production began in the 1950s. However, despite its versatility and usefulness, “plastic has often been misused and is frequently applied to single-use items which are discarded with little regard for environmental consequences.”
“Most of the plastic ever made still exists in some form today,” Fai said. “When people say, ‘just throw it away,’ we must remember — there is no ‘away.’ Everything remains within the boundaries of our shared environment. The planet simply cannot absorb this volume of waste indefinitely. If current trends continue, some projections estimate that by 2050, there could be more plastic than fish in our oceans. This is not just alarming — it’s a call to urgent action.”
A “circular economy,” Ferreira said, could have a larger long-term impact on single-use plastic reduction. A circular economy broadens the familiar slogan of “reduce, reuse, recycle” to “rethink, refuse, reduce, reuse, repair and recycle,” in that order.
Brazil has an extraordinary biodiversity, Fai said, and a significant agro-industrial biomass base, rich in polysaccharides such as starch, pectin, lignin, and others. These valuable raw materials can be transformed into bio-based and biodegradable packaging for the food industry, she added.
“Through international partnerships, where each research group contributes its unique expertise, we can join efforts to develop sustainable and innovative packaging solutions,” Fai said. “This collaborative approach is key to building a more sustainable future for food systems worldwide,” said Fai and Barone.
“We are part of the problem as consumers, but at the end of the day, as consumers we can be part of the solution,” Ferreira said.

 Plastics on the farm

Heather Friedrich, director of the Center for Arkansas Farms and Food, said while there are a lot of plastics used in agriculture, her team avoids single-use plastics as much as possible out of concern for the environment and to reduce consumption.

“In our transplant production, rather than using the single-use plastics that you see in a store when you get plants, we use extra sturdy plastic transplant trays,” Friedrich said. “We know farmers who have used these for 20-plus years and are still strong.”
Friedrich said the CAFF farm also uses a paper pot system adapted from Japan that uses a chain of paper strips to form cells in which they grow the transplants. The training farm also uses a landscape fabric instead of plastic mulch for weed control, which can be reused over many years.
However, use of single-use plastic is unavoidable at times. For its “tractor-scale” production, CAFF uses the black plastic seen on strawberry beds at u-pick operations.
“Plants respond well to plasticulture because it warms the soil early, creates a weed free zone and delivers water directly to the plant roots,” Friedrich said. “The current biodegradable options for this function can’t hold up over the long, hot season.”
A thick, clear plastic is used to cover high tunnels at the farm, but that material has a longer lifespan of four to six years. High tunnels differ from greenhouses by generally having less climate control but still allow protection of plants from the elements and extend the growing season from early spring to late fall.
Irrigation drip tape — a flat tubing that provides water directly to plant roots — can also be a source of plastic on the farm, Friedrich said, and they try to use theirs for multiple years to minimize landfill deposits.
“In other areas of the state, there are recycling options that farmers can off-load their irrigation plastic,” Friedrich said.
Polypipe is commonly used for irrigation in row crop operations. When the season has ended, farmers roll up the pipe and drop it off for recycling.
The Center for Arkansas Farms and Food was developed to strengthen and expand our food and farming system by providing new opportunities to shape our current and future farmers, food entrepreneurs and food system leaders. CAFF is a program of the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station through the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.
Through experiential learning, the center’s programs train farmers and food entrepreneurs with the production and business skills and resources necessary to develop resilient businesses that sustain our ecosystem, our land and our communities.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)At a time when my classmates were learning the building blocks of reading, my first grade teacher was informing my mother that I’d be illiterate.
Let’s just say that learning my teacher had washed her hands of me solely because I wasn’t hooked on phonics went over like a lead balloon with my mother, a former classroom teacher whose education degree featured a speciality in reading.
Every day after school that year, my mother worked with me at home, teaching me how to read. Thanks to her tutelage, by the time I reached second grade I was reading at grade level. And by third grade, I was reading well above it. 
That lived experience of having a first-grade teacher who didn’t have the slightest idea how to teach a core foundational subject to a struggling student is one of the reasons I’m positively petrified by Oklahoma lawmakers’ absurd plan to put people without teaching experience — or even any college education — at the helm of our pre-K through third grade classrooms.
Supporters say hiring these so-called “adjuncts,” who must only have “distinguished qualifications in their field,” will help address our state’s ongoing teacher shortage. Opponents suspect hiring untrained teachers could cause long-term negative consequences for our youngest students.
Oklahoma lawmakers were the first in the nation to try this failed experiment with our older grades, and it’s worked so well that we still have some of the worst academic outcomes in the nation as trained teachers continue to leave the profession in droves. 
So, it is mindboggling that we’d now want to expand this concept to our youngest students who desperately need qualified teachers who know how to manage classrooms and teach foundational skills.
Because one thing I’ve learned from virtual school days is that it is not easy to teach my children, who are in their foundational grades, despite me theoretically having “distinguished qualifications” in reading and writing by way of winning journalism awards and leading a newsroom.
It terrifies me that our crippling teacher shortage has led us to a point where we think it’s prudent to use people with no formal education training to teach our youngest children the building blocks that they’ll need to be successful throughout life.
I could see allowing districts to temporarily hire people who are enrolled in college and maybe a few hours away from the completion of their education degree, but we’d have to be crazy — or desperate — to entrust someone untrained to teach reading just because they can read well.
In response to criticism, some Republicans now propose requiring adjuncts to complete training on how to teach children to read — by the end of their second year in the classroom.
What about the poor kids who are placed in that adjunct’s classroom that first year? Are they disposable? Why is it suddenly OK to allow some children to fall through the cracks and be victims of our adult leaders’ inability to keep qualified educators in their classroom?
I could have been one of the children who fell through the cracks had I not had a determined mother with an education degree at home.
Because while I arrived in second grade able to read, I discovered I lacked the basic math skills required because my first-grade teacher didn’t teach that subject at all. I suspect she didn’t know how, and as a result, I spent several weeks taking remedial courses to get caught up.
Years later, I still remember how miserable — and confusing — it was to be behind my peers. My class didn’t stop to wait for me to get caught up. My second-grade teacher continued to build on what I was supposed to have already learned.
We’re at a crossroads, and my question is do we want our classrooms to produce well-educated students? Or do we want our schools to be little more than a babysitting service?
If lawmakers want our schools to simply be low-paid babysitters, then be brave enough to admit it. But I suspect they don’t want to say the quiet part out loud because their constituents — and businesses — demand that we produce students who are literate in math and reading.
If we can’t get qualified people to teach, then lawmakers need to do some soul searching and figure out what’s fundamentally wrong with how they’re doing things. 
Every child should have someone in their life like my mother, who can fill the gaps, but they don’t. Our lawmakers should be moving mountains to ensure every child has the best teachers in their public school classrooms, not taking dangerous short cuts that put student outcomes at risk.

It's Workers Memorial Day. Yet Wyoming elected officials mostly silent in wake of yet another alarming report of workplace carnage, advocates say.
The post Labor advocates: Most lethal state in the nation for workers ignores blue-collar plight appeared first on WyoFile .","In 2023, a worker died after falling through a skylight on a construction job. Another died after being thrown from a front-end loader. Yet another was buried in a trench collapse and two were crushed by vehicles they were either inspecting or repairing at the time, according to the Wyoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s fatal accident alerts website.
The five “alerts” — limited to two sentences or less — belie the actual extent of occupational fatalities in Wyoming that year. Forty-five workers died on the job in 2023 — a 32.4% increase over the previous year and the deadliest since 2007, according to the state’s most recent annual report on workplace fatalities. 
Unless a local newsroom reports on a workplace fatality, or there’s civil litigation, most victims’ names disappear into the maw of multiple bureaucracies where extracting the type of information that might point to problem areas and potential solutions is frustratingly difficult, advocates and officials say.
“These aren’t just statistics — they’re our neighbors, family members and fellow Wyomingites,” Wyoming AFL-CIO Executive Director Marcie Kindred said in a prepared statement.

Today is Workers Memorial Day. Workers and their advocates will gather at the steps of the Capitol in Cheyenne beginning at 5:30 p.m. to commemorate the dozens of lives lost each year while on the job in Wyoming. The workplace tragedies are not only preventable but so frequent that Wyoming has ranked the worst or among the worst in the nation — on a per-capita basis — for decades, according to federal data.
The state doesn’t appear to be on track to shed its deadly distinction.
Last year was comparably deadly, though there’s no official tally yet, and at least four workers have died on the job so far this year, according to Wyoming OSHA. They include: David Wesley Moore, 58, of Douglas, killed in a natural gas compressor station fire in Converse County; Alexander Harsha, 22, of Rock Springs, hit by a door that was struck by a forklift in Sweetwater County; Liam Cobb, 19, of Casper, died by suicide, falling from a wind tower in Carbon County; and Denice Downing, 47, of Gillette, killed in a tanker-truck explosion in Campbell County.
“Year after year, we gather [on Workers Memorial Day] to honor those we’ve lost, yet we see no meaningful improvement in workplace safety,” Kindred said. “We need concrete action to protect Wyoming’s workers.”
Despite the state’s December report confirming yet another notch to Wyoming’s dishonor as the “deadliest,” it doesn’t appear that the carnage — including the hardships families face — is a priority among elected officials. Past state-level initiatives, along with some industry-led safety efforts, seem to have fallen by the wayside, advocates say. Rather than a call to action to understand how to make Wyoming workplaces safer, Kindred said, worker advocates had to fight this year to defeat a measure to reduce unemployment benefits.

Kindred said she recently told union members: “Your elected officials spent your taxpayer dollars arguing about pronouns and bathrooms. Meanwhile, we’re dying out here.”
Each year, the Wyoming AFL-CIO, along with the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association, pleads with lawmakers to take on the worker fatality crisis as an interim topic, and each year, legislative leadership declines. 
“I don’t think we value workers in Wyoming like we should,” said Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association Executive Director Marcia Shanor, who has advocated for workplace safety for decades. “If we did, we would never tolerate 45 people being killed without asking about it.”
What’s driving the crisis?
The 45 occupational fatalities in 2023 made Wyoming the most lethal state in the nation for workers on a per-capita basis — by a long shot. 
Wyoming recorded 16 fatalities per 100,000 workers, according to the most recent federal data available. North Dakota was second at 9.8 deaths per 100,000 workers, and Mississippi followed at 6.9 deaths per 100,000 workers.

Agriculture, ranching and forestry were among the most deadly work sectors, according to the state’s annual report, followed by mining and oil and natural gas extraction. Across all industries, highway crashes and vehicular accidents accounted for 67% of all occupational fatalities in 2023.
At face value, workplace fatalities can appear to be “random” from year to year, according to Wyoming OSHA Program Manager Christian Graham. It’s tempting, he said, to point to Wyoming’s often-hazardous driving conditions, or unregulated ranch work, or employees shirking safety protocols. 
“There’s so many instances where sometimes these can be prevented if we just slow down and pay attention,” Graham said.
Yet, it’s difficult to derive from data what exactly is behind Wyoming’s worker fatality problem, Graham cautioned. The labor, safety and workforce regulatory world is full of reductive reports and databases that, individually, don’t reveal root causes or how to address them. To understand and effectively address what plagues workplace safety, Graham said, requires deep, ongoing analysis and interaction with employers and employees. Wyoming OSHA and the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services do have those conversations with both employers and employees, he said. The agencies also oversee multiple programs that go beyond inspections and enforcement to provide services such as safety training and voluntary consultations.

“One death is too many,” Graham said, adding that more resources are always welcome. “We do our best while we’re out there to present our programs, and we’re completing our inspections throughout the state.”
Though workplace inspections and training programs are vital, the state does not do enough to hold employers accountable, Kindred said. She bristles when people chalk up the state’s track record to vehicle accidents and on-the-job suicides and homicides — which are included in the state’s tally.
“We also have the highest rates of suicide in the nation, and that’s a workers’ issue,” Kindred said. “If they’re doing it on the job, these are deaths of despair because they’re at this job they hate that doesn’t pay enough and they can’t support their families.
“And if a lot of these [vehicle fatalities] are out-of-state truckers,” Kindred added, “we need to make sure they’re prepared. We need to be better neighbors. If people are sending their workers to Wyoming and they’re dying, that’s not the reputation we want.”
There’s always a desire to pin the blame on workers for taking short cuts or not following procedures without acknowledging the pressures they’re under and things they don’t have control over, like improperly maintained equipment or the right tools for the job, said Tyson Logan, a partner at the Spence Law Firm, which specializes in workers’ rights.

“We see it all the time,” Logan said. “Wyoming workers are going out to do their job and being killed because of corporate negligence or recklessness. And what we see again and again is that companies just aren’t making their workers’ safety a priority.”
Most employers provide proper training and equipment and encourage a culture of safety, Logan said, noting a slow cultural shift over decades.
“It’s daunting, though. The problem is it’s not every company or every job,” he said. “When the economy is not as strong, companies tend to take more risks. When there’s fewer people, there’s more expectations and trying to do more with less. That’s when people get hurt.”
There are myriad inherent on-the-job risks in Wyoming, including long commutes to remote locations and working around heavy equipment, said Rep. Lee Filer, a Republican from Cheyenne who owns a company that builds and operates data centers.
“Every bit of the equipment they’re running, none of it is forgiving,” Filer said. “If it’s a forklift or front-end loader, that’s thousands of pounds hitting you. So it doesn’t take much.”
Despite embracing safe workplace practices while serving in the military and as a union representative with the railroad, Filer admits he lost a fingertip to a saw blade due to his own recklessness.

“I did it myself,” he said. “But I do the best I can to make sure that my crew is safe. I always tell them, ‘Come let me know if you have a concern,’ because I don’t want anybody getting hurt. And I’ve been pretty successful with that.”
Too many workers, however, feel they’re under pressure and don’t speak up, he said. His biggest worry is worker fatigue and commuting to and from work.
“It could be mandatory overtime issues where people maybe work 12 hours, 16 hours, then have to drive home,” Filer said. “Wyoming is always going to have a bad rap on this because of our shift work. A lot of our industries — the coal mines and railroads — those places are 24/7 operations.”
What’s being done about it?
Beginning in the 2000s, a spike in fatalities and injuries that coincided with a coalbed methane and natural gas drilling boom spurred advocates like the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association, Wyoming AFL-CIO and the Equality State Policy Center to increase pressure on leaders in Cheyenne.
The response wasn’t immediate. But eventually, the state organized special hearings and there was a genuine statewide discussion about how to make workplaces safer, according to Shanor, who played a key advocacy role. Industries responded, too, forming the Wyoming Oil and Gas Industry Safety Alliance, the Wyoming Transportation Safety Coalition and a new safety training center in Casper.

There were even modest reforms — which were hard-fought, Shanor said — such as an annual cost-of-living adjustment and an increase in death benefits under the Wyoming Workers’ Compensation program. The Legislature in 2014 considered increasing fines and penalties for egregious safety violations to dissuade what some referred to as a “disposable worker” attitude among some employers in the region. The state even created an occupational epidemiologist position at Wyoming Workforce Services to not only analyze workplace fatality and injury data, but to coordinate information among multiple, siloed agencies that investigate worker fatalities to help identify strategies to do something about it.
The drive to finally address Wyoming’s workplace fatality epidemic, however, petered out, Shanor said. 
The Wyoming Oil and Gas Industry Safety Alliance is no longer active, according to Wyoming OSHA, and the Wyoming Transportation Safety Coalition is trying to regain footing. The state recently reclassified the occupational epidemiologist post to an “OSHA compliance assistance position,” which means the state is no longer performing the deep analysis of root causes like it had in the past.
OSHA defended the changes as enhancing “our ability to support health and safety throughout the state by guiding rule and standard development, conducting outreach, and being an accessible resource.”
But Shanor, the workforce safety advocate, doesn’t see it that way. 
“That’s a huge loss,” she said. 
“I just think we lack leadership,” she added. “I worry that maybe we let them off the hook after COVID.”

Kindred, of the AFL-CIO, was more blunt.
“[Wyoming leaders] like to talk about our work ethic and how we love our workers; We get the job done and we don’t complain,” Kindred said. “But when it comes time to put our policies and our efforts where our mouth is, we just want workers to be our mascot. We don’t really want to support them in any way.”
It’s disheartening, Kindred added, because Wyoming really is the place where people will pull over to help a stranger broken down on the side of the road. “That’s why our continued inaction on workplace safety is so jarring. It contradicts our fundamental values.”
Filer, who served on the Labor, Health and Social Services Committee during his first stint in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2014, said he’s seen a shift in the Legislature from solving Wyoming problems to adhering to ideology.
“Worker safety, to me, is not an ideology or political position,” Filer said. “It’s something that everybody can probably agree on — that everybody wants to come home to their family when they get off work.”

Filer said he’s in favor of asking for more detailed reports, analysis and ideas from Wyoming Workforce Services and Wyoming OSHA, and generally prioritizing the workplace fatality epidemic at the Legislature. While he’s adamantly opposed to regulations, some are necessary, like “OSHA laws,” Filer said. “There’s a reason those [laws] are on the books. It’s because they were written in blood.”
Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee Co-Chair Rep. Landon Brown, a Republican from Cheyenne, said he wants the panel to take up the worker transportation safety issue this year. 
Labor Committee co-chairs Sen. Eric Barlow of Gillette and Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams of Cody, both Republicans, did not respond to WyoFile’s inquiry about whether the committee will take on the issue. 
Among the committee’s proposed topics this year, however, is to consider lowering — again — what employers pay into the workers’ compensation program to “promote a more business-friendly environment” and “random” drug and alcohol testing of employees at state-funded institutions.
“It is time to reenergize this conversation and return worker safety to the forefront where it belongs,” Shanor said. “This silence is not just troubling; it is unacceptable.”

The Biden administration proposed a rule that would have required state Medicaid programs to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, but the Trump administration said it will leave the option up to the states. (Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.










I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University


GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

It took nearly two years and some international maneuvering, but now those protective jackets, pants, boots, helmets and air tanks are headed to the city of about 75,000 in the mountainous state of Michoacan, Mexico — to be used by a volunteer team Perez said relied on donations to build their station and a hodgepodge of items for body protection.
“This is about a good humanitarian act where we have equipment we have to dispose of that still has a lot of life in it and can be of use to people who need it,” said Perez, who has lived in Nebraska since age 8 when his family emigrated from Zacapu.
 Cultural pride

Perez joined Columbus Fire Chief Ryan Gray, the Omaha-based Mexican Consul and a few dozen others last week at a reception at Bellevue University that marked the donation — and a celebratory visit by the mayor of Zacapu, Mónica Valdez Pulido. 
While in Nebraska for four days, Valdez, who in Mexico is known as la presidente municipal de Zacapu, finalized details for the delivery, met with officials involved and visited local communities where many natives of Michoacan have settled.
At a time when many immigrants feel threatened and unwelcome by policies of the Trump administration, Nebraska Latino leaders embraced the cross-border collaboration and act of international goodwill as an occasion to spotlight cultural ties and pride.

“May this moment inspire us all to keep building bridges of collaboration, friendship, and brotherhood,” Yesenia Peck, of the Nebraska Hispanic Chamber Foundation, said at last week’s reception.
Peck called the occasion more than just a transfer of equipment. 
“It is a powerful reminder that when communities come together, even across borders, we can create lasting impact,” she said, and in this case, support those who risk their own well-being to help protect others.
Valdez — the first woman mayor of her city, in a nation led by its first female president — told the group that she looked forward to a continued alliance with Nebraska and Columbus, whose population of about 25,000 is now more than 26% Latino. 
 Saving lives, protecting their own  

Statewide, about 12% of Nebraska identifies as being Hispanic or Latino, according to the U.S. Census, with the bulk of those being of Mexican descent.

Valdez pointed out new partnerships built in the process with Omaha-based Mexican Consul Jorge Ernesto Espejel Montes, whose office represents the Mexican government in Nebraska and Iowa, and Karina Perez, executive director of Columbus-based Centro Hispano Comunitario de Nebraska, a nonprofit formed in 2009 to help connect the influx of immigrant families to their new communities. 
Columbus now has two Latinas on the City Council, both of whom were in the audience.
Also attending the Bellevue reception was Omaha’s first female fire chief, Kathy Bossman, and Sergio Robles, the Omaha Fire Department’s public education specialist.
Valdez called the gift and partnership a “historic” occasion and noted that the  Zacapu bomberos are volunteers who fight fires and do so with inferior protective gear.
“With the right equipment, they’ll be able to continue to save lives but also to protect their own lives,” she said. The Zacapu team was arranging to pay to transport the gear from Columbus to Mexico.
 Remembering his roots

Valdez offered a particular shoutout to Aaron Perez, noting that despite having grown up mostly in Nebraska, “he has not forgotten his roots.”
Perez, in an interview, recalled nearly two years ago when his Columbus Fire Department was preparing to get rid of the outdated equipment. Age put the gear outside acceptable U.S. safety standards, but Perez said it was still useful. 
He recalled photos and conversations from his parents’ recent visit to Zacapu. He said the city’s volunteer firefighting gear appeared to be “pieced together” from other places. What Columbus had to offer included an ensemble for about 40 firefighters, including bunker jackets, pants, boots, helmets, hoods, masks and breathing packs.

Gray, the Columbus fire chief, said his current force includes 32 paid firefighters and eight reserves, who get paid an hourly rate when activated. Because of U.S. firefighting standards, options for expired equipment are limited, he said.
“Even though we may not be able to use it here, it doesn’t mean other places can’t use it to help fulfill their duties,” said Gray. “It really came down to the message of humanity and helping other communities.”
He said the City of Columbus views the donation of its taxpayer-funded equipment as an extension of its investment.
The effort was accelerated when Valdez took office about seven months ago, said Perez, who said she was more enthused about the idea than her predecessor. 
“I feel really thankful that our city, our department, and everybody else here was willing and able to do this,” said Perez, 34, who is hoping to return to his hometown soon to see the safety gear in action. 



 Mexican heritage runs deep in Husker state 

Asked to speak about the Mexican settlement in Nebraska, Omahan Cesar Garcia offered full disclosure: He is a native of Colombia.
He smiled, saying many assume he is from Mexico, which has the oldest and still largest share of the state’s Latino population. “And that is a big honor, an amazing thing,” he said, noting that he’s come to know Mexican culture and history better in the 27 years he’s lived in the state.

Garcia, as executive director of nonprofit Canopy South, is based in South Omaha, where Garcia said his team works to build up housing, jobs and other opportunities in a community largely composed of immigrants, refugees and families of Mexican descent.
He spoke at an event last week marking the visit of a Mexican contingent led by the mayor of Zacapu, Mónica Valdez Pulido. That a Colombia-born Latino leader was describing the area’s Mexican immigration patterns provides insight into the expanding population in Nebraska.
The diversity was noticeable among organizers and attendees of the reception at Bellevue University. Speakers included Yesenia Peck, originally of Peru, and Karina Perez, whose parents emigrated from El Salvador originally to California.
Those in the audience included a representative of the local Guatemalan Consulate, along with a team from the Mexican Consulate, both based in Omaha. 
Later generations of Spanish-speaking immigrants were represented in the audience, part of the 12% of Nebraskans who, according to the latest Census data, identified as Hispanic or Latino.
A further breakdown of 2022 Census estimates, by the Office of Latin American Studies at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, showed that Latin Americans make up about half of the 7.5% of the state’s population born in a foreign country.
Among those native born in Latin America: 62% are from Mexico; 14% from Guatemala; 7% from El Salvador; nearly 5% from Cuba; nearly 4% from Honduras and 8% from other countries in Latin America.
Garcia told the group that Nebraska’s Mexican population swelled in the early 1900s, as immigrants were lured largely by jobs picking beets in western Nebraska and in South Omaha’s meatpacking industry.
South Omaha was known as a landing point for European and Latin American newcomers as far back as the late 1800s. Garcia said many European families have moved to western and suburban areas, while many old and new Latino families remain. 
He told the group that Mexican and Latino culture is an economic driver in areas such as South Omaha and has become mainstream in various ways throughout the state. 
“There is no corner in the state of Nebraska where you won’t find a Mexican restaurant,” Garcia said. “It’s part of American culture.”

“As land management agencies governing these wilderness areas have seen — and expect to continue to see — dramatic shifts in capacity so far this year, a stable, consistent base of volunteers to look after our Central Idaho trails is key to keeping these shared spaces maintained,” Idaho Conservation League officials said in a written statement. “If you spend some of your summer recreating in Central Idaho’s beautiful wilderness areas and are concerned about the use, accessibility, and wildness of these spectacular places, this program is for you.”
Applications for the Wilderness Stewards program are available online and are due by May 2. 
New wilderness stewards volunteers are required to complete training June 7 at the Sawtooth National Recreation Area headquarters in Ketchum. After they are accepted into the program, wilderness stewards will be asked to complete four patrols between June and September.

Wilderness stewards patrol the Sawtooth Wilderness, Hemingway-Boulders Wilderness, Cecil D. Andrus-White Clouds Wilderness, Craters of the Moon National Monument, Jim McClure-Jerry Peak Wilderness and recommended wilderness areas in the Sawtooth and Salmon-Challis national forests.
The Wilderness Stewards Program began in 2016. 
Since the program launched, wilderness stewards have packed 200 pounds of trash out of Idaho wilderness areas, cleared or naturalized 761 illegal fire rings and removed 182 human waste issues, according to the Idaho Conservation League.
Wilderness stewards also share Leave No Trace principles with other trail users they meet. Since 2016, wilderness stewards have engaged with 120,775 other trail users, the Idaho Conservation League reported. 
Founded in 1973, the Idaho Conservation League is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization with offices in Boise, Sandpoint, Ketchum and McCall that works to protect air, water, land and wildlife.

Colorado had a 4.5% increase in births last year, the largest in the nation, as births increased nationally for the first time since 2021. (Photo courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an email.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Johnathan Cohen/Getty Images)It was a stunning loss for Idaho’s agricultural community: On April 16 the U.S. Department of Agriculture withdrew a $59 million grant from the University of Idaho’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
The Partnerships for Climate-Smart Communities grant was designed to help state agriculture producers develop more sustainable business practices as part of the Farmers First initiative. Before the termination, 201 Idaho producers representing 34 counties had already signed up for the program.
Federal government terminates University of Idaho climate grant for farmers

A University of Idaho press release said many of the producers had completed all the paperwork and were enrolled, others were in the final stages of enrollment.
In Idaho, agribusiness is 20 percent of the state’s industrial backbone. Agribusiness includes crops, seed, dairy, livestock, wine and beer cultivation and sales. This makes agriculture the state’s number one industry, followed by lumber, chemicals and paper, mining and tourism.
Overall, Idaho is the seventh largest agribusiness state in the country, led by livestock and dairy sales at more than 50 percent of all agribusiness sales. Any assistance to this large industry can only help the state grow.
Historically, this was the largest grant to UI in school history. When the new administration drew up new guidelines, the USDA withdrew the grant because Idaho’s plan fell short of the requirements.
How short? The new guidelines would require the program, titled the UI Innovative Agriculture and Marketing Program, to allocate at least 65 percent of the money to go to producers. Under the withdrawn grant, UI allocated more than 50 percent of the funds to go directly to state producers. The remaining nearly 50 percent was allocated for grant management and providing technical and marketing services to the enrolled producers.
UI can reapply, but there is no guarantee one will be awarded or that the school will receive same amount of money as the original grant. The deadline for the new Advanced Markets for Producers initiative is June 20.
Innovative Agriculture and Marketing Program co-director Sanford Eigenbrode said while disappointed, the UI is in a good position to re-apply for the grant by reconfiguring the numbers to meet the new guidelines.
Why was the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Communities grant eliminated? According to the federal government, it was because it was a Biden-era program. Under the current administration, just about anything that came from the previous administration is being labeled “bad” and being removed.
The grants were designed to help any state’s agribusinesses better compete in the world marketplace. Under the Innovative Agriculture and Marketing Program, information gathered by UI faculty, staff and students provided technical support and guidance to Idaho producers, helping them make better informed decisions about their financial bottom line. Overall, the program was designed to help reduce risks to agribusinesses and help them engage in new practices.
Granted, many people say the administrative costs of such programs can be high when run through a university. Often, depending on the university and the grant, administrative costs can run as high as 50 percent or more.
To better help Idaho’s agribusiness community, UI and other state universities need to adjust their administrative costs so more money can flow to the intended targets, in this case, the farmers and ranchers.
But even more needs to be done. As indicated, there is no guarantee that the grant will be re-issued to Idaho. This should now be priority work for the state’s congressional delegation. In Washington, D.C., Idaho’s U.S. senators and House members need to engage with their staff members and the USDA to regain at least part of, if not all, the grant money.
Failing to do so would mean the congressional delegation will be unsuccessfully representing their primary constituents: Idaho’s very large rural and agribusiness communities.
Anyone who has lived here knows Idaho is much more than potatoes. The state’s agribusinesses are vital to the state’s economic well-being.
To help improve especially small agribusinesses, it is time for schools to adjust their overhead expenses and for those elected officials to truly help their constituents by fighting for a reinstatement of the Farmers First philosophy grant.

(Photo: Getty Images)Legislation to guarantee teen victims of sexual assault the right to a forensic rape exam without parental consent failed in the Tennessee Legislature last week, despite drawing strong bipartisan support.
The legislation was brought as a technical fix to the 2024 “Families’ Rights and Responsibilities Act,” which established a parent’s right to “make all physical and mental healthcare decisions for the child and consent to all physical and mental health care on the child’s behalf.”
The legislation was among the most recent brought in reaction to the lingering impacts of COVID-era vaccine and testing mandates. Tennessee lawmakers have already passed legislation requiring parental consent for all vaccines.
But forensic rape exams, which include collecting evidence for law enforcement and providing medical care and support to victims, were not explicitly made an exception to the 2024 parental consent law, which adds hefty penalties for healthcare providers who fail to comply: parents have the right to sue doctors and nurses who fail to get their consent, and healthcare providers may face professional discipline, including the loss of their licenses.
As a result, some sexual assault centers in Tennessee are interpreting the law as tying their hands in serving teens without a parent’s permission and have turned young victims away to avoid legal repercussions, victim advocates in Tennessee said this week.
TBI makes progress in reducing rape kit backlog

“We have ended up with programs across the state interpreting this law differently,” said Jennifer Escue, CEO of the Tennessee Coalition to End Domestic & Sexual Violence. At least one sexual assault center in East Tennessee has told her it has been unable to serve teen victims on the advice of its attorneys, she said. 
“The consequences of this are potentially devastating,” Escue said. “It takes so much courage, so much bravery, to seek out an exam. To be denied that…they could very well decide they don’t want to go through with reporting the crime. It denies an opportunity for collecting evidence, and it might be that someone who is sexually assaulting a minor goes free.”
Most teenagers do inform their parents, Escue said. But others may feel reluctant or afraid. 
Teens are far more likely to have been victimized by someone inside their home or within their family circle, including a parent. A 2024 Tennessee law allowing the death penalty for child rape convictions may add to the reluctance by even nonoffending adults to consent to a teen’s rape exam if the perpetrator is known to them, she noted. 
The Sexual Assault Center in Nashville continues to provide forensic exams to teens 14 and older, a practice it has opted not to change with the passage of the 2024 law, said Rachel Freeman, president of the Sexual Assault Center in Nashville.
Facing criticism for turning away victims, Murfreesboro hospital to ‘rebuild’ sex assault program

“We’ve had legal counsel saying they can interpret this either way,” she said. “We’ve decided it’s worth the risk, and the right thing to do is provide exams to minors who need them.”
“This is time sensitive,” Freeman said. “It cannot be done after 96 hours. That’s a very short period of time to try and convince, let’s say a mother, to try and get a rape kit.” 
The bill by Sen. Heidi Campbell and Rep. Bob Freeman, both Nashville Democrats, would have explicitly ensured that the “consent of a parent or guardian is not required for the victim to receive a forensic medical examination” for minors who are victims of sex crimes. 
The measure easily sailed through legislative committees and received a rare unanimous vote on the House floor. 
Then it stalled on the Senate floor last week after Sen. Adam Lowe, a Republican from Calhoun, raised the spectre of children as young as his elementary school-aged daughter undergoing a rape exam over allegations that did not involve a parent as perpetrator.
“Someone could take my daughter for an examination without notifying me,” Lowe said. “That would be a very potent and traumatizing experience.”
Sen. Brent Taylor, a Memphis Republican who previously voted in favor of the bill in committee, then moved to send the bill back for further committee debate, citing “serious concerns” raised by Lowe and effectively killing the measure for the year. 
Victim advocates said Lowe’s concerns are based on a misunderstanding of systems in place to address child rape and sexual abuse. 
  “The reality is a five-year-old is not going to get a medical legal rape kit,” said Rep. Bob Freeman, a Nashville Democrat. (Photo: John Partpilo/Tennessee Lookout)
The Sexual Assault Center in Nashville does not provide rape exams to elementary-school-aged children. The agency serves victims starting at age 16, Freeman said. 
Child sex abuse victims 13 and younger are typically referred to Child Advocacy Centers and undergo a separate pediatric forensic process, Law enforcement and the Department of Children’s Services are notified. 
“The reality is a five year old is not going to get a medical legal rape kit,” Freeman said. 
Like all sexual assault centers, Freeman’s agency is a mandatory reporter of child abuse: the assault on any victim under the age of 18 who visits the center is reported to the Department of Children’s Services and law enforcement, which, in turn, contact non-offending parents.
“They certainly pull in parents when that happens,” Freeman said. “The reality is that the people who need to know will end up knowing.
Freeman worries that teens in Tennessee will be discouraged from seeking out help after being sexually assaulted but stressed that sexual assault centers will help them. 
A statewide crisis line can direct teens and other victims to available services and resources. The Tennessee Statewide Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24/7 to provide support and information to sexual assault survivors: 866-811-7473.

When the Trump administration cut more than $11 billion in COVID-era funds to states in late March, addiction recovery programs suffered swift losses.
An Indiana organization that employs people in recovery to help peers with substance use disorders and mental illness was forced to lay off three workers. A Texas digital support service for people with addiction and mental illness prepared to shutter its 24/7 call line within a week. A Minnesota program focused on addiction in the East African community curtailed its outreach to vulnerable people on the street.
Although the federal assistance was awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic and some of the funds supported activities related to infectious disease, a sizable chunk went to programs on mental health and addiction. The latter are both chronic concerns in the U.S. that were exacerbated during the pandemic and continue to affect millions of Americans. Colorado, for example, received more than $30 million for such programs and Minnesota received nearly $28 million, according to health and human services agencies in those states.

In many cases, this money flowed to addiction recovery services, which go beyond traditional treatment to help people with substance use disorders rebuild their lives. These programs do things that insurers often don’t reimburse, such as driving people to medical appointments and court hearings, crafting résumés and training them for new jobs, finding them housing, and helping them build social connections unrelated to drugs.
A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s cuts, allowing the programs to continue — for now — receiving federal funding. But many of the affected programs say they can’t easily rehire people they laid off or resurrect services they curtailed. And they’re unsure they can survive long-term amid an environment of uncertainty and fear, not knowing when the judge’s ruling might be lifted or another funding source cut.
The week it slashed the funding, the Trump administration also announced a massive reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services, including the consolidation of the main federal agency focused on addiction recovery services. Without a stand-alone office like the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, many advocates worry, recovery work — and the funding to support it — will no longer be a priority. Although private foundations and state governments may step in, it’s unlikely they could match the tranches of federal funding.
“Recovery support is treated as optional,” said Racquel Garcia, founder of HardBeauty, a Colorado-based addiction recovery organization.
The federal cuts put at risk a roughly $75,000 grant her team had received to care for pregnant women with substance use disorders in two rural counties in Colorado.
“It’s very easy to make sweeping decisions from the top in the name of money, when you don’t have to be the one to tell the mom, ‘We can’t show up today,’” Garcia said. “When you never have to sit in front of the mama who really needed us to be there.”
Mental health conditions, including substance use disorders, are a leading cause of maternal mortality in the U.S. And although national overdose deaths have decreased recently, rates have risen in many Black and Native American communities. Many people in the addiction field worry these funding rollbacks could reverse hard-earned progress.










You can’t have manufacturing if people can’t pass a urine drug test or continue to suffer from addiction or relapse.


– Rahul Gupta


U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard told KFF Health News that the department is reorganizing to improve efficiency, foster a more coordinated approach to addiction, and prioritize funding projects that align with the president’s Make America Healthy Again initiative.
“We aim to streamline resources and eliminate redundancies, ensuring that essential mental health and substance use disorder services are delivered more effectively,” she said in a statement.
But to Garcia, it doesn’t feel like streamlining. It feels like abandoning moms in need.
Between the time the cuts were announced and when the federal judge paused them, two women served by Garcia’s program gave birth, she said. Though her grant funding was in limbo, Garcia told her employee to show up at the bedside for both moms. The employee followed up with daily check-ins for the new moms, connected them to treatment or housing services when needed, and helped them navigate the child services system.
“I just can’t leave moms” without services, Garcia said. “I just can’t do it.”
Nor can she abandon that employee, she said. Although the federal funding provided half of that employee’s salary, Garcia has continued to keep her on full time.
Garcia said she primarily employs women in recovery, many of whom spent years trapped in abusive situations, relying on welfare benefits. Now they’re sober and have found meaningful work that allows them to provide for their families, she said. “We created our own workforce of mamas who help other mamas.”
This type of recovery workforce development seems to align with the Republican Party’s goals of getting more people to work and reducing reliance on welfare benefits. The Trump administration’s drug policy priorities, released in early April, identified creating “a skilled, recovery-ready workforce” and strengthening peer recovery support services as crucial efforts to help people “find recovery and lead productive, healthy lives.” Many recovery programs train people for blue-collar jobs, which could support Trump’s goal of reviving the manufacturing industry.
But the administration’s actions appear to conflict with its stated goals, said Rahul Gupta, the nation’s drug czar during the Biden administration.
“You can’t have manufacturing if people can’t pass a urine drug test or continue to suffer from addiction or relapse,” said Gupta, who is now president of GATC Health, a company using artificial intelligence for drug development.
Even if jobs return to rural America, cutting funding for recovery services and the main federal office overseeing such efforts could mean fewer people are employable, Gupta said.
Research on recovery programs, particularly those run by people with personal addiction experience, suggests they can increase engagement in court-ordered treatment, reduce the prevalence of rearrest, bolster attendance at treatment appointments, and improve the likelihood of families reunifying and stabilizing.
Billy O’Bryan sees these benefits daily. As a state director for the national nonprofit Young People in Recovery, O’Bryan oversees about a dozen chapters in Kentucky that teach people in recovery life skills, such as balancing a checkbook and interviewing for jobs, and show them how to have fun in sobriety, through group hikes and glow-in-the-dark Ultimate Frisbee games.
Providing recovery services “is when we really invest in their future,” said O’Bryan, who is in recovery too.
Six of his chapters were affected by the federal funding cuts. That has meant dipping into his organization’s rainy day fund to pay staff and cutting back on community events, including cleanup days in which chapter members gather used syringes off the street, pass out the overdose reversal medication naloxone, and talk to people using drugs about the possibility of recovery.
He’s exploring fundraising efforts now, but not all his chapters have the same ability.
“In a city like Louisville, fundraising is not a problem,” O’Bryan said, “but when you get out into Grayson, Kentucky” — a rural area in the Appalachian Mountains — “there’s not a lot of opportunities.”

In Minnesota, Kaleab Woldegiorgis and his colleagues at Niyyah Recovery Initiative used to spend hours a day at soup kitchens, community events, mosques, and on the streets of East African and Muslim neighborhoods, trying to connect with people using drugs. They spoke Somali, Amharic, and Swahili, among other languages.
Those outreach efforts allowed them to “find individuals in need of recovery services” who “weren’t seeking it out themselves,” said Woldegiorgis, who previously attended Niyyah’s support groups when he was dealing with addiction.
After building relationships with people, Woldegiorgis could help them connect with formal recovery services that bill their insurance, he said. But help couldn’t always wait for a contract.
One afternoon shortly before the federal funding cuts, Woldegiorgis and his colleagues spoke with a man who began weeping, recounting how he had wanted to get treatment a few days earlier but had lost his belongings, returned to using drugs, and ended up on the street. Woldegiorgis said he helped the man reconnect with a sister and begin exploring treatment options.
With the federal funding cuts, Niyyah may no longer be able to support this type of outreach work. Woldegiorgis fears it means people won’t receive the message of hope that can come from interacting with role models in recovery.
“People don’t pick up pamphlets to receive these messages. And people don’t read emails and people don’t look at billboards and find inspiration,” he said. “People need people.”

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at FEMA


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

Kennedy Jr. speaks at the Rx and Illicit Drug Summit at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 24, 2025. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s push to “Make America Healthy Again” is making some North Dakota farmers queasy. 
Kennedy’s MAHA movement shuns highly processed foods and dyes. But it also includes an attack on oils made from seeds such as sunflowers and canola, with North Dakota being a leading producer of those specialty crops.
These oils are among what has become known as the “Hateful Eight,” oils from canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, soy, rice bran, sunflower and safflower targeted by the MAHA movement. 
During a roundtable discussion last week in Fargo with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, representatives of crops such as sunflowers, canola, soybeans and lentils said the MAHA movement is troubling for their members.  
Rollins is part of a MAHA Commission, created by President Donald Trump, with Kennedy as the chair.

John Sandbakken is executive director of the National Sunflower Association, headquartered in North Dakota but representing growers around the country. He said he has heard from farmers in multiple states concerned about the Rollins’ role on the MAHA Commission, led by Kennedy. 
“There’s a lot of misinformation out on the internet about seed oils, and we are hoping, as groups, that you will be a strong advocate for seed oils and the healthy benefits that they do bring to our consumers,” Sandbakken said.
Rollins responded that Kennedy is a “unique voice.” 
“My commitment is to be a vigorous and persistent advocate for all agriculture, including the great people that you represent,” Rollins said. 
The American Heart Institute is among the groups siding with seed oils advocates that they are healthy. 
Kennedy is backing beef tallow, a cooking oil that fell out of favor for being high in saturated fat.

An oil that is low in saturated fat is canola oil.  
Tim Mickelson, a Rolla farmer who is president of the U.S. Canola Association, encouraged Rollins to “follow the science” on health and ag research.
Mickelson said he fears the anti-seed oil movement is gaining momentum among consumers, which is just one of the problems facing canola growers. 
Mickelson farms near the U.S. border with Canada, where most canola is grown. 
He said canola prices in the U.S. follow the prices on Winnipeg Commodity Exchange and prices are also affected by the Canadian dollar.

“So if you’re pushing ideas of a tariff on Canada, and it’s hitting canola, you’re going to hit the futures price negatively. You’re also going to hit the Canadian dollar negatively,” Mickelson said. “So canola is getting a double whammy.” 
He said even the rumors of tariffs hurt the canola market. “Anytime somebody would sneeze on the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange about a tariff, canola would just be plummeting down,” Mickelson said. 
He said the market fell about 20% in March as tariffs with Canada were making headlines. 
“Anything that disrupts the flow of canola between the United States and Canada is detrimental to the entire industry,” Mickelson said. 
While the canola market has rebounded, he said the tariff talk and market drop was happening as farmers were making final decisions about what to plant in the 2025 growing season. 
The United States had a record year for canola production in 2024, most of it coming from North Dakota, according to the U.S. Canola Association. There were 2.7 million acres planted to canola in 30 states last year, led by North Dakota with more than 2.1 million acres.
Mickelson said with farmers concerned about changing consumer demand for canola oil and the timing of the tariff talk, canola acres could be down by 20% this year. 
Mickelson said he was grateful that Rollins came to North Dakota. 
“I think she has very good intentions on taking what we talked about today and trying to implement the things that need to be changed,” Mickelson said, but acknowledged that she has less influence on the MAHA movement than the health secretary. 
“That’s a big challenge,” Mickelson said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/John Partipilo)The city of Nashville has sued the federal government over the abrupt halt of federal public health grants to vaccinate children, test for infectious disease, operate community clinics and conduct outreach to unhoused individuals.
The lawsuit, filed Thursday in a Washington, D.C. federal court, alleges the Centers for Disease Control and Infection (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) illegally terminated $11.4 billion in federal public health funding across the nation last month. The lawsuit claims the action usurped the authority of Congress, which appropriated the funding during the COVID era for current and future pandemic preparedness. 
The grants to Nashville and other local governments were terminated “for cause,” a term that applies to wrongdoing on the recipients’ part. The federal government, however, said the “end of the [COVID] pandemic constituted its cause.” Being terminated from a federal grant for cause can impact the ability to get new grants.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” a March HHS statement about the funding cuts quoted in the lawsuit said. “HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Health Again.”










It could delay investigation and follow up to vaccine preventable diseases, such as Hep A (Hepatitis A) and B, measles, pertussis (whooping cough), among many others, unless we find other sources of funding which could lead to increased instances and more acute cases of vaccine preventable diseases.


– Dr. Sammi Areola, Metro Nashville Pubic Health


An HHS spokesperson on Friday declined to comment further on the litigation.
Nashville joined Harris County, Texas, Columbus, Ohio, Kansas City, Missouri and the American Federation of County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO in filing the suit, which also names HHS chief Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and CDC acting director Susan Monarez. The CDC is overseen by HHS.
The lawsuit said the funding to public health departments reflected Congress’ intent to address the “longer term challenges it knew the country would face in Covid-19’s wake, including gaps in the public health system and the need for investment in critical public health infrastructure.”
Metro Nashville Public Health Director Sanmi Areola said Friday he was “concerned about the impacts of the funding losses on the health of our residents.” 
Among the Nashville health services impacted are efforts to ensure children are up-to-date on vaccines, oversight of daycare immunization compliance, providing back-to-school physicals and delays in receiving immunization records, he said. 
Areola said the cuts could lead to more acute cases of vaccine-preventable diseases.
“It could delay investigation and follow up to vaccine preventable diseases, such as Hep A (Hepatitis A) and B, measles, pertussis (whooping cough), among many others, unless we find other sources of funding which could lead to increased instances and more acute cases of vaccine preventable diseases,” Dr. Areola said via email. 
Dr. Areola said health officials are working to minimize impacts on services. 
Nashville received word March 25 that it had lost the funding effective the prior day, March 24. 
The public health department has had to cut 16 full time staff in a division that conducted health and resource barrier screenings. The public health department can also no longer move forward with six already-advertised positions to do outreach to homeless individuals, the lawsuit said.
Plans to purchase a mobile medical unit have been shelved, too.
The lawsuit is seeking the restoration of funding and a declaration that the actions by the Trump administration were unlawful. The federal government has not yet filed a formal legal response to the lawsuit, and no court dates have yet been set.

“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland | Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.











They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency



Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Get rid of FEMA? Trump-appointed group to look at shifting disaster response to states.

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo by Coady Media) Beyond Kentucky’s borders, horse racing is a sport in steep decline. Within the commonwealth, however, wealth is common.
Though no fewer than 48 American racetracks have closed since 2000, Kentucky operators continue to invest hundreds of millions in their facilities and are reaping an outsized return, and not only on the first Saturday in May. 
For instance:
Churchill Downs Inc. reported record net revenue ($2.7 billion) and net income ($427 million) for 2024. 
Keeneland’s September Yearling Sale netted a record $427.9 million. 
The 2006 races run in Kentucky in 2024 paid an average purse of $112,648, 20% higher than the second most lucrative state (Arkansas). 
September’s seven-day all-grass meet at Kentucky Downs in Franklin paid out $490,789 per race, easily the highest total ever recorded at a North American track. 
“Retreat to Kentucky if you want a future in racing,” California horseplayer Andy Asaro tweeted on April 15. “Things are moving fast.”

Beyond the Bluegrass, things are moving mostly in reverse. Jockey Club data shows the number of Thoroughbred races run in the United States has dropped by more than 50% since 1995, and the size of the national foal crop has been falling even faster, from 34,358 in 2007 to an estimated 16,675 last year. The Sonoma County Fair recently announced it will forego live racing for the first time since 1936 because of a shrinking supply of horses in Northern California. Last month, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled the state’s historical horse racing machines unconstitutional, prompting Churchill Downs Inc. to project a 25% cut in purses at its Fair Grounds racetrack.
Slots-lite a double-edged sword 
Meanwhile, “decoupling” legislation that could free Florida gaming operators of the obligation to stage live racing as a condition of their licenses has been stalled, but may only represent a temporary reprieve from redevelopment of major tracks. The Stronach Group’s 1/ST Racing, which owns Gulfstream and Santa Anita, has threatened to sell both tracks while showing a pronounced inclination to divest rather than invest in its properties. Last year, the company closed Golden Gate Fields near San Francisco and cut a deal that turned over Baltimore’s Pimlico, the home of the Preakness Stakes, to the state of Maryland. 
Against this gloomy backdrop, and in contrast to its own contentious closure of Arlington Park near Chicago, Churchill Downs Inc. continues to spend aggressively on its flagship track. Plans for new capital projects with a projected cost of $920 million were put on pause last Wednesday, ostensibly in response to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and trade disputes,  but recent improvements to the paddock and the addition of Homestretch Club and Turn One Experience cost in excess of $300 million and speak to management’s long-term bullishness. 
While these investments are largely attributable to the singular appeal of the Kentucky Derby, they also reflect the thoroughbred industry’s political influence in Frankfort and, in turn, the gushing revenue stream historical horse racing (HHR) terminals have unleashed. 
Since their 2011 introduction at Kentucky Downs, the slot-like historical horse racing terminals have reinvigorated racing in the state. Programmed to pay out based on the results of races previously run, Kentucky’s HHR machines generated more than $9.6 billion in handle during the 2024 fiscal year, accounting for $99 in bets for every $1 wagered live at the state’s thoroughbred and standardbred tracks. 
They contributed $55.5 million to Kentucky’s Thoroughbred Development Fund during that 12-month period, fueling the growth of purses that have more than doubled since 2017. Consequently, Eric Hamelback, CEO of the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, refers to HHR’s proliferation as racing’s “golden ticket.”

When HHR’s legality was challenged in 2018, Ellis Park General Manager Jeffery Inman said the loss of that revenue would “likely threaten the very survival of one of Kentucky’s iconic racing venues.” Though opposition was vocal, it was handily outvoted. Attorney Ryan Roark, in an article published in the Kentucky Law Journal, wrote that the legislature settled on a definition of pari-mutuel wagering “not shared by anyone outside Kentucky … to allow for the powerful horse industry to exclusively run their slot-like gaming systems.” 
The result, says Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen, has been a “juggernaut.” According to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, gross HHR commissions for Churchill Downs’ two Derby City Gaming locations exceeded $224 million for the 2024 fiscal year, nearly 12 times the total commissions from on-track wagering at all of the state’s racetracks. 
To the extent this disparity underscores the industry’s reliance on revenue sources that require no physical horses, it inevitably raises questions about racing’s sustainability and the best use of its real estate.

“Racing is on life support in Southern California, Florida, Delaware, Pennsylvania etc. and exists almost everywhere else only with the support of non-racing revenues from slots, casinos and state supplements,” Kenwood Racing founder H. Robb Levinsky wrote in a January letter to Thoroughbred Daily News. “Instead of embracing innovative ideas to make the sport more attractive to a new generation of racing fans and owners, the focus continues to be on protecting those non-racing revenues. An industry where 80-90% of purse money comes from slots instead of wagering on the core product is simply not viable in the long run.”
Signs of progress in New York, Maryland
In the short run, at least, the growth of Kentucky’s purses has led to a higher quality of horses competing in the state, more interest among bettors and a breeding boom running contrary to national trends. As Ed DeRosa documented for Horse Racing Nation, Kentucky passed both California and Florida in total handle in 2024 after trailing both states annually since 2007. 
“We’re the only jurisdiction (among the top four states) that has grown since 2020,” said Chauncey Morris, executive director of the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association. “The rest have contracted.”
And as cash incentives for Kentucky-breds have increased, so has the state’s share of registered foals. When HHR was introduced at Kentucky Downs in 2011, Kentucky produced 29.2% of the national foal crop. In 2023, the most recent year for which statistics are available, it was 42.2%.   
  Damon Thayer (LRC Public Information)
“In states where racing has a good relationship with state legislators, racing is in good shape,” said consultant Damon Thayer, formerly the Kentucky Senate’s majority floor leader. “In states where they have not cultivated a long-term relationship with the legislature, horse racing is either in a declining state, a crisis state or a questionable state.”
In addition to Kentucky, there are pockets of progress. New York and Maryland have committed nearly a billion dollars to renovations at Belmont Park and Pimlico. Multiple industry executives cited developments in Wyoming, the nation’s last populous state, as a basis for bullishness. Yet their optimism is tempered by unsolved problems in larger locales, including the most populous state, California. 
Without supplemental income from other forms of gambling, California’s racing and breeding businesses have been contracting for decades. Efforts to enhance purses through HHR remain at the discussion stage in view of Native American tribes’ virtual monopoly on the state’s casino gaming. Unless some accommodation can be reached, racing columnist Ray Paulick warns, “racing in California is history.”
“You can put 1,000 HHRs in at Santa Anita and it would change California racing overnight,” Thayer said. “They’d be wildly popular. You’d direct the money to purses and breeders reward programs and it would be a huge success. It seems like some sort of attempt should be made to cut a deal with the Indians and convince them that 1,000 HHRs at Santa Anita is not going to damage their land-based casinos. . .
“Like Cyndi Lauper used to say, money changes everything.”

(Ben Wasserstein)In a parking lot across from the governor’s residence filled with construction trucks and contractor vans, a crowd of around 200 gathered and listened to prayers, songs and speeches from members of different faiths — Jewish, Christian, Sufi and Baha’i. They had marched nearly a mile from Temple Beth El, a conservative synagogue on the Susquehanna River, for a vigil organized by the Jewish Federation of Greater Harrisburg.
Only days earlier, Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family were evacuated from the residence just before 2 a.m., hours after their Seder celebrating the first night of Passover. Someone had thrown Molotov cocktails into the room downstairs that was prepared for their next Seder, engulfing it in flames.
“We say in our Seder ‘Let all who are hungry come and eat’ and we open the door,” Rabbi Melody Davis, one of the attendees, told the Capital-Star. She added the attack evoked a history of pogroms against Jewish people on the Passover holiday. 
“For this to happen, [it] affects all of us,” she said.

Details of what happened in the early morning hours of April 13 trickled out over the following few days. A man, Cody Balmer of Harrisburg, was arrested after turning himself in to state police. Images of the destruction — a burnt Haggadah, a Jewish prayer book recited at Passover Seders, melted tables and blackened plates — were shown in news stories about the incident around the world
Balmer told authorities he would have attacked Shapiro with a hammer had he come across him, and acted because he did not want to “take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.”
It is not known if Balmer targeted Shapiro explicitly because of his Jewish faith, or intentionally acted on Passover, but the circumstances of the attack, the images that have emerged, and what is publicly known of his motive have raised fears in Pennsylvania’s Jewish community at a time when many already already feel vulnerable.
Since the beginning of the conflict in Gaza that began with Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the emergence of a protest movement opposing Israel’s campaign that’s estimated to have killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, debates over what constitutes antisemitism and how institutions and governments should respond have been thrust into the center of American politics. And the Trump administration has used the specter of antisemitism to justify some of its most divisive policies.
In the state that bore witness to the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history in 2018 at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the spotlight on Jews has left many feeling vulnerable. That sense was exacerbated following the attack on Pennsylvania’s highest-ranking Jewish official.
“A lot of the conversations I’ve been having are with people saying, ‘This is our worst fear confirmed,’” said Laura Cherner, the director of the community relations council at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. 
Cherner’s job, as she describes it, involves keeping a finger on the pulse of how Jews are responding to a reported rise in antisemitism incidents that accelerated following the outbreak of war in Gaza. Since the attack on Shapiro, Cherner has received dozens of calls.
“Often, Jews feel like a political football,” she added. “I think, ultimately, many feel like this is almost a confirmation of what we’ve been talking about. We’ve been trying to raise awareness and screaming from the rooftops of the increase in antisemitism.”

Urging caution
The state’s Jewish community has different views on whether the attack on Shapiro can be called antisemitic, but the imagery that emerged from it left an indelible mark.
“I don’t know a single Jewish family that wasn’t talking about it on the second night Seder,” said Andrew Goretsky, regional director for the ADL-Philadelphia. “What happened at Governor Shapiro’s residence, this has an impact,” 
For the members of the Tree of Life congregation in Pittsburgh, the photos from earlier this month of the burnt room triggered memories from the 2018 mass shooting that killed 11 people. 
“We’ve been in that room. Some of us have been there multiple times,” said Alan Hausman, the president of the Tree of Life Congregation, referring to the reception room in the governor’s residence. “No matter what the motivation is, it’s a difficult thing to look at.”
Following news of the attack, members of the congregation began writing a letter to express solidarity and support for Shapiro. But drafting it proved difficult, and Hausman had concerns with an early iteration.
Initially, he said, it focused too much on the circumstances and timing of the attack on Passover.
“I don’t think that’s important,” Hausman said. “What’s important is to tell him, ‘We’re here. We’re gonna help you get through this. We’re going to help you rebuild.’”
It’s part of a broader message he wants to get across: Don’t jump to conclusions about Balmer’s motive when so much remains unclear.
“There are people that immediately go to, ‘This is 100% antisemitic,’” Hausman said. “But we want to caution against that.”
Members of Hausman’s synagogue know better than most what an investigation into an attacker’s motivation can look like, and how to sit with both the knowns and unknowns. And Hausman worries that prematurely ascribing an antisemitic motive to the attack could cause undue panic and fear.
Shapiro has urged similar caution, refusing in interviews and press conferences to weigh in on whether Balmer should be charged with a hate crime until investigations play out.
But not all Jewish faith leaders share that perspective.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At a synagogue only a mile-and-a-half from Tree of Life, Rabbi Daniel Fellman wrestled with the same questions over how to address the matter with his congregation.
He first heard about the arson attack when he got an alert on his smart watch during a service on the first morning of Passover. During that day’s prayer for healing, he said words for Shapiro and his family, and left it at that
But as more details emerged, he felt the timing of the attack, and the decision to target a vocally Jewish elected leader over an international conflict he has no control over, led to a clear conclusion.
So on the Friday after the attack, Fellman dedicated the majority of his sermon to calling out what he saw as an explicitly antisemitic attack.
“If you ask me personally, if Governor Shapiro was a good Lutheran, that firebombing wouldn’t have occurred in Harrisburg at the governor’s (residence). It just wouldn’t have happened, and we have to acknowledge that,” Fellman said. “People need to understand that was an attack not just on the governor and his family, but an attack on all of us here. And it was certainly an attack on the people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

‘Outside Pressures’
For Fellman, the violence can’t be viewed in a vacuum. 
Since Hamas attacked Israel in the fall of 2023, and Israel responded by waging a war on occupied Gaza that has killed tens of thousands, Fellman has felt a need to speak out, including criticizing what he saw as Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinians.
His congregation includes both fierce critics and defenders of Israel. Most, he noted, are somewhere in the middle, which he defines roughly as believing in the country’s right to exist, while disagreeing with many of its actions. He is encouraging dialogue, even teaching a class on modern Israel that addresses history and politics.
“Jews are raised and nurtured on arguing for the sake of Heaven. We believe in discussion. We believe in debate,” Fellman said. “The difference here is the outside pressures that this has released … That has made this much more complicated for the folks in my community.”
Those outside pressures, he said, include people who he sees as conflating the actions of the state of Israel with a reflection of the desires of the Jewish community writ large.
Fellman, who describes himself as a moderate, says he sees that in the actions of pro-Palestinian protesters who have targeted Jewish students and businesses. And he sees it on the political right, where politicians have cheered on the punishment and deportation of critics of Israel in the name of opposing antisemitism.
“I think for most American Jews, we’re feeling the confusion and the unsettledness of it all,” Fellman said. “And the governor’s mansion being firebombed is just adding to that.”

‘Red herring’
In its 2024 audit, the Anti-Defamation League noted that around half of the more than 5,000 anti-Israel rallies contained antisemitic rhetoric. The ADL included justification of antisemitic violence, equating Judaism with Nazism and celebration of the October 7 attacks as antisemitic rhetoric or activity.
The ADL has been under scrutiny after its CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, made comments conflating anti-zionism and antisemitism. But the group said its audit conforms with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, which includes holding the Jewish people as a whole accountable for the actions of the Israeli government.

Ten days into his second term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order taking steps to combat antisemitism.
But for some Jewish people, those bring their own concerns.

Sen. Judy Schwank (D-Berks), co-chair of the Pennsylvania Jewish Legislative Caucus,  worries about what these measures will mean for the Jewish people in the future.
“Are we going to face the brunt of the anger of people about what the administration is doing?” she said.
Since the executive order, the federal government has arrested students who spoke out against Israel on the grounds that they were participating in antisemitic activities or even endorsing terrorism. 

This includes Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University student from Turkey who was in the U.S. on a visa. Her apparent crime was co-writing an 2024 op-ed in her student newspaper urging her school to divest from companies with ties to Israel. 
Öztürk was approached and arrested by six plainclothes federal agents on a street near her home in Massachusetts and placed in an unmarked car.  Now, she’s in a detention center in Louisiana fighting her potential deportation in court. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said that Öztürk engaged in activities supporting Hamas, the militant group that governs the Gaza strip and is deemed a terrorist organization by the U.S.. But an internal memo from the U.S. Department of State, reported by the Washington Post, said they found no evidence linking her to Hamas or engaging in antisemitic activities.

Security camera footage of Öztürk’s arrest went viral, and became a rallying call for critics of the Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to snatch and deport student visa holders for their roles in anti-Israel protests.
“I believe that agents within the federal government representing the Trump administration are calling out antisemitism, but it’s really just a red herring, an excuse to forcibly and maybe illegally remove people from this country,” Schwank said.
Following multiple lawsuits, the Trump administration reversed course and restored thousands of revoked student visas, but a federal lawyer told one judge that U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement is developing a policy for future revocations.
Rabbi Linda Holtzman, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace, argued that reports of antisemitism at pro-Palestinian protests have been drastically overemphasized, and that the narrative is being used to punish those protesting.
“What’s clear to me is that the Trump administration uses antisemitism in order to punish Palestinian rights activists who are trying to stop a United States-backed genocide … that’s where I see antisemitism being used in a way that’s illegitimate and inappropriate,” she said.
She worries that what she believes are false accusations of antisemitism obscure people’s ability to address legitimate concerns. 
Jonathan Goldman, chair of the Pennsylvania Jewish Coalition, does see a link between anti-Israel protests and rising reports of antisemitism.
“I believe it’s intellectually possible to have views that are anti-Israel — anti the state of Israel — and not be antisemitic,” Goldman said. “But man, is that slice of cake thin.”
Still, he opposes policies punishing foreign students who participated in protests without offering them due process, and of threatening universities where protests took place.
For him, the images of Öztürk’s arrest, and the crackdown on perceived political enemies more broadly, evoke darker times of Jewish history.
“I watched that video before bed, and then I watched it again the next day,” Goldman said. “Those are not Jewish Values … Historically speaking, Jews do well where a society is more free and democratic politically.”
But Goldman has spoken to some Jewish people who support the administration’s efforts to combat alleged antisemitism, but as he sees it, those tools can be turned on other perceived enemies.
“The Jewish institutions are scared, even the ones I’m representing,” Goldman said.
“What’s happening in the broader political environment is insane, and it’s affecting the way people are feeling with regard to this firebombing and the way people are acting and speaking with regard to it.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)No one complained when state regulators quietly allowed hemp-derived THC beverages to be sold in Rhode Island’s liquor stores late last summer. 
But now that state lawmakers are considering codifying the rules, the state’s cannabis cultivators and retailers are speaking out, saying the liquor industry is circumventing stringent guidelines they’ve had to follow to get their psychoactive products to market
A bill sponsored by Rep. Jacquelyn Baginski, a Cranston Democrat, would declare it legal for licensed distributors to sell beverages containing up to 5mg of delta-9 THC at liquor stores, bars, and restaurants. The bill would also increase the fee liquor wholesalers pay for the right to sell these products. Companion legislation is sponsored in the Senate by Robert Britto, an East Providence Democrat.
“The goal of my legislation is to get our arms around the sale of beverages that are already being sold,” Baginski said in an interview. “For every good actor and retailer who goes out and goes through the trouble of requiring that license, there are potentially one or two who have not done that.’”
Existing hemp rules allow the sale of delta-9 THC products such as gummies, lozenges, packaged baked goods, and beverages at licensed retailers. The state now has 120 hemp retailers and distributors, which include businesses headquartered in Colorado, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. 
Connecticut last July mandated THC-infused drinks only be available at state-licensed liquor stores and cannabis retailers. Massachusetts regulators, meanwhile, declared last May that intoxicating hemp-based products cannot be sold outside of cannabis retail stores.
Under Baginski’s and Britto’s bills, the annual fee paid by liquor wholesalers would increase from $500 to $1,500 to distribute delta-9 THC drinks under rules crafted by the state’s Department of Business Regulation. Bars and restaurants would have to pay $250 a year. 
Rhode Island’s seven cannabis dispensaries, meanwhile, pay a yearly $30,000 licensing fee to sell THC products. Those rules are based on regulations crafted by the state’s Cannabis Control Commission.
“Why is one held to all this high regulation, while the other is not?” Magnus Thorsson, a professor at Johnson & Wales University’s Cannabis Entrepreneurship Program, told Rhode Island Current. “It’s not fair and balanced.”
Mike Simpson, co-founder of Lovewell farms in Hopkinton, said he’s fine with liquor stores being allowed to sell hemp products in Rhode Island. He just wishes that hemp growers like himself had a say in the initial legislation.
“They completely left out the existing hemp industry, as if we don’t exist,” Simpson said in an interview Thursday. “This kind of not only feels superfluous, but also feels like they didn’t actually engage with the industry — I hope they’re open to hearing.”
Baginski acknowledged that she has not met with hemp industry leaders but said she is always willing to connect with them.
“I don’t claim to know everything, and I am happy to take all the feedback out there for me to absorb,” she said. 
Baginiski’s bill received its initial hearing before the House Corporations Committee on April 8, where it was held for further study as is standard practice during a first vetting by a legislative panel.
The state’s liquor industry is backing the proposal.

Rhode Island Liquor Operators Collaborative Executive Director Nicholas Fede Jr. said alcohol retailers are well-positioned to be part of the hemp-derived THC market. He told Rhode Island Current that store owners and staff are already trained to recognize the effects of intoxicating substances when interacting with customers.
“We have a long history of high product integrity,” Fede said. “We are the gatekeepers for public safety.”
Alex Nendza, director of marketing for Bottles Fine Wine on Providence’s East Side, understands the sense of resentment coming from cannabis dispensaries and cultivators but said he believes having more retail outlets will help the industry grow.
THC drinks already account for 10% of Bottles’ revenue. 
“It’s difficult to keep them in stock at times,” Nendza said in an interview. “Our shelves empty out pretty fast.”
Getting THC from CBD
Hemp has been legal at the federal level since 2018. Hemp-derived THC drinks were technically illegal in Rhode Island — at least until last August when the state’s Office of Cannabis Regulation began allowing the sale of products containing low levels of delta-9 THC at licensed retailers, which includes vape shops and liquor stores.
Beverages derived from cannabis continue to only be sold at licensed cannabis retailers. Hemp by itself produces little to no THC content and is typically non-psychoactive when first harvested, unlike other cannabis plants.
“It’s a molecule, and your body doesn’t make any discretion at all to where it comes from,” Stuart Procter, co-founder and lab director for cannabis testing facility PureVita Labs in West Warwick, said
The main difference is how the psychoactive compound is derived. 
Delta-9 is a naturally-occurring cannabinoid within cannabis plants. With hemp, it takes a little chemical magic to convert non-psychoactive CBD into THC. Methods include soaking the hemp material in a liquid like butane or ethanol, applying enough pressure and heat to extract THC compounds, or exposing the plant to acid.
“If all of the processes are done properly by chemists and people who know what they’re doing, you probably end up with a nice safe product which is absolutely identical to the delta-9 taken from marijuana plants,” said Procter, who chairs the Cannabis Advisory Board’s Public Health Subcommittee.
But because hemp testing rules vary from state to state, Procter said safety isn’t always guaranteed.
“There are very limited to no testing standards guiding hemp-related products,” he said. “If you were to bring hemp into the same regulatory protocols that would make sense — if they want to play in the same market, they should abide by the same regulations.”

Conflicting rules?
During the bill’s April 8 hearing, Baginski told lawmakers she was surprised to see hemp-based THC products available on the marketplace “and largely sold unregulated.”
“The intent of this legislation is not to make any changes to the existing structure of sales of marijuana-based THC, but to create a new safe marketplace for hemp THC beverages.”
But state regulators argue Baginski’s proposal could conflict with existing cannabis rules. 
Cannabis Control Commission Chairperson Kimberly Ahern wrote to the committee that the existing bill would revoke several existing hemp licenses and contradicts the state’s commitment to “building a robust cannabis economy.”
Hemp-derived THC products under Baginski’s bill would not be subject to the same testing, labeling restrictions, and additional safety protocols required under existing rules and upcoming regulations required for recreational cannabis.
“The absence of clear requirements for psychoactive hemp-derived products increases the risk of accidental overconsumption and potential exposure to vulnerable populations, including youth,” Ahern warned.
Ahern asked that the General Assembly hold the bill until regulators and industry leaders could discuss “alignment with the state’s broader cannabis and hemp regulatory strategy.”
Baginski said she’s open to making any necessary changes to the bill to ensure it aligns with existing regulations, adding that the goal of any legislation is to spark conversation and let the democratic process unfold.
“I do think it’s worth having a conversation about who we’re selling these things to and what exactly they are,” she told Rhode Island Current.

ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.



FEMA denies assistance to some KY counties affected by February floods

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says the state will appeal FEMA’s denial last week of assistance to some Kentucky counties affected by flooding in February.
The agency determined the severity and magnitude in those counties did not warrant assistance, says a letter from an acting assistant administrator in the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
FEMA denied public assistance for the February flooding to local governments in Simpson and Woodford counties, and individual assistance to six counties: Butler, Franklin, Knox, Laurel, Lawrence and Whitley.
In a news release, Beshear said 68 counties have been approved for public assistance and 16 counties for assistance to individuals. 
Meanwhile, Beshear announced that President Donald Trump has approved part of Kentucky’s April 11 request for a major disaster declaration stemming, which includes individual assistance for Kentuckians in 13 of the counties affected by the most recent flooding. 
The state’s requests for public assistance for 33 counties and hazard mitigation for the entire state are still pending.
Individual assistance has been approved for Anderson, Butler, Carroll, Christian, Clark, Franklin, Hardin, Hopkins, Jessamine, McCracken, Mercer, Owen and Woodford counties. The governor will request that additional counties be added to the declaration through an amendment once ongoing assessments are complete. 


“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
Beshear says dismantling FEMA would be ‘disastrous’ though improvements need to continue

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
Some Kentucky Republicans echo Trump’s complaints about FEMA after latest flood

But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)As she briefed contractors about their upcoming bids to rebuild housing in western North Carolina last week, a state official laid out a candid assessment of the mission ahead.
“We need you, desperately, to build those homes and get people home,” said Angie Dunaway, the director of contracting for the NC Department of Commerce’s new team leading Hurricane Helene recovery efforts.
In early May, the state will begin fielding offers from companies to demolish, repair and rebuild homes destroyed by the deadliest storm in North Carolina history.
It is a monumental task in both scope and logistics. The western mountains will require “some special type of building,” Dunaway told contractors. And the capital involved will be immense — including more than $1.4 billion in federal money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
At every turn, the process will be closely scrutinized. Mismanagement and accounting errors plagued the state’s home rebuilding program after Hurricanes Matthew and Florence. Years later, some of those homes are still incomplete. Furious state lawmakers have made it clear they have little patience this time around.
Gov. Josh Stein has taken a different route than his predecessor, former Gov. Roy Cooper, and spun up new teams to spearhead recovery for Helene. He and his top lieutenants have said they intend for those teams to be smaller and leaner — making private sector contracts all the more critical.
When contractors are selected and get to work, day-to-day operations will look different than they have in the east. State officials do not intend to pay to put up survivors in hotels except in “extreme” circumstances; newly-built homes will follow strict floor plans and timelines; and every interaction between homeowners and builders must be thoroughly documented.
HUD approved the state’s plan to spend its $1.4 billion on Friday — taking another step toward repairing and rebuilding more than 73,000 total damaged homes, and around 8,800 that are significantly damaged or totally destroyed.

Jonathan Krebs, Stein’s advisory for western North Carolina, told contractors they are aiming to be “swinging hammers at the first homes in July.”
State is leaning on contractors for rebuild. Here’s what they’re asking of them
Instead of hiring dozens of new state workers to oversee rebuilding efforts, Stein’s administration is bringing on a contractor to manage the day-to-day operations.
Bidding has been open for that role, referred to as the “implementation vendor,” since mid-April. That company, once selected, will open intake centers, identify projects and source them out to construction vendors.
State officials are aiming to contract around 25 companies for home demolition, repair and rebuild (hundreds of bids are expected). Those contracts will be for at least three years, but up to six, with one-year renewal options.
The constructors must be licensed in North Carolina, and will be selected based on a wide swath of criteria — but foremost, their ability to do “quality work, fast.”
“We want you out there building homes, as quickly as possible,” Dunaway told contractors.
Companies will indicate which types of projects they want to handle — new builds or repairs. They’ll be paid, through the state’s management vendor, based on a project’s phases being completed. Dunaway said it was the state’s intent “that all vendors will be paid the same thing for each project.”
After the contractor receives a “notice to proceed” — an OK to begin construction — they will have up to 150 days to complete the project. Unless they receive a state-approved delay, they’ll be charged $100 per day they go over that deadline. The deadline for each project will depend on its scale: some could include repairs to private roads or bridges on the property, which the state is also contracting for separately.
Newly-built homes will have a two-year warranty. The state needs companies to document that they’re financially sound to ensure they’re around for the duration of that warranty.
In eastern North Carolina, rebuilding dragged on in part because of customizable homes with various layouts. That won’t be an option for homeowners this time. The state is planning to have a limited set of layouts — two-, three- and four-bedroom floor plans, all with two bathrooms — that will be provided by contractors and reused throughout the program.
The administration is also doing away with long-term hotel stays that racked up costs and infuriated legislators during rebuild efforts in the east.
“Unlike previous programs, we are expecting the homeowners to figure it out in most instances,” Krebs told contractors. “Not every homeowner in every instance is going to be relocated at the state’s expense.”
Relocation will happen as a “last resort” and only in “extreme” circumstances.
The state is also requiring construction vendors to have office space on-site in western North Carolina. Dunaway cited state lawmakers’ request that there be a “visual presence” in the region.
“Some of my kinfolk even complained about y’all’s accent,” Rep. Karl Gillespie (R-Cherokee) told state officials in January, as he relayed frustrations from locals about Raleigh. “But if you’re on the ground, we’ll make allowances for your accent.”
The state wants contractors to be able to hold in-person meetings with homeowners if needed, and to thoroughly document every interaction with them. The managing company will plan to set up three offices across 39 counties — and all contractors are expected to provide “extraordinary customer service.”
“When you engage with those applicants, those homeowners, we are looking for it to be positive,” Dunaway said.
FEMA denied North Carolina’s request for permanent housing earlier this year
Earlier this year, North Carolina sought another avenue for rebuilding homes in the mountains — FEMA.
The agency’s housing assistance program offers permanent repairs or new construction for households after disasters, depending on specific circumstances and eligibility. North Carolina applied for that construction, but the request was denied by FEMA.
“[Permanent housing construction] would not be an appropriate form of direct housing as alternative housing options in North Carolina exist,” FEMA disaster recovery manager Brett Howard wrote in an internal memo sent to administrators Feb. 26 and obtained by NC Newsline.
FEMA identified 269 North Carolina homeowners eligible for direct housing assistance as of late February, according to the memo. Twenty-seven of those homeowners would have been eligible for permanent housing aid, but the agency found 85 available resources, including 47 FEMA-contracted properties, that the homeowners could use.

Stein’s communications director, Kate Frauenfelder, confirmed that the governor’s office had requested the program in January. FEMA told them they no longer had the authority to issue permanent housing construction “except in extreme circumstances.”
As of April 22, 5,298 North Carolina households are receiving rental assistance, according to joint state and federal data. Another 216 are in mobile homes or trailers; 31 are in FEMA-leased properties, and 18 are in hotels or transitional shelter.
FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on its denial of the program, which has not been previously reported. In a news release last week, the agency touted its grants sent to North Carolina and its communities since January.
The agency recently denied a request from the state to extend its 100% reimbursement rate for debris removal and emergency services. Those rates now stand at 90%.

Community connection can also make a difference by reducing stress, isolation and feelings of judgment or shame. (Getty Images)In a moment, so much can change in a family’s life. 
A last-minute work schedule change that leads to relying on an unsafe babysitter. An unsupportive reaction from a bystander that could have been a connection point for support and kindness rather than further shame and frustration. A busy morning with medications left unattended and the toddler reaches up on the counter. A job loss that led to a relapse for a parent who struggles with substance use. 
Or a knock on the door from child protective services following up on an accusation of maltreatment.
Kentucky families face these real-life moments every day. And, the reality is, that last-minute change, that split-second decision, that dismissive reaction can be the key to safety or harm.
The latest national Child Maltreatment report cites that Kentucky has nearly double the national rate of child victims of maltreatment, with babies and young children remaining as the most vulnerable. It’s our tendency to think of those tragic child abuse cases featured on the news — but, when you further break down the numbers, over half of those substantiated cases were categorized as neglect. 
These families face substance misuse, domestic violence and economic stressors – all leading to deepened parental stress, mental health concerns and unstable living conditions. 
Kentucky’s Child Fatality and Near Fatality External Review Panel’s latest report further extrapolates the state of child safety. The most common cause of child deaths or near deaths in Kentucky: neglect due to access to deadly means or supervisory neglect, such as unsafe storage of firearms or of medications or illicit substances that then led to a tragedy. 
In nearly three-quarters of the cases reviewed, the family faced financial issues, and over half had substance misuse present in the home and two-thirds had a history of DCBS involvement. 
As business and faith leaders, elected officials, health providers, educators and just as good neighbors, we can play a role in supporting families in those moments of need and in all of those moments that lead to it.
What does that look like in practice? 
Most clearly, direct support, such as food and child care assistance, are proven to make a big difference in promoting well-being. When a family’s basic needs are met, parental stress goes down and child safety goes up — bottom line. 
If we know this and have a commitment to preventing child maltreatment in Kentucky, we must not jeopardize access to these critical supports for working parents struggling to make ends meet while juggling child rearing. For example, support in accessing safe child care is a “moment” that can prevent an incident of preventable abuse with an unsafe babysitter.
Next, when looking at the child maltreatment and fatality data, we can pull out some key moments in which a family is most vulnerable to their stress and frustration going too far — mainly in those critical first years of a child’s life. 
Babies are most likely to be victims, so let’s better equip new parents with tips on sleep safety and how to soothe a crying baby. Potty training can be a frustrating moment (or many, many moments) for parents and their toddler — let’s promote best practices in achieving that milestone. The HANDS home-visiting program and other voluntary parenting education courses can be a helping hand for parents to strengthen their skills and knowledge on developmentally appropriate expectations for their young children. 
Finally, when faced with challenging moments or even in those moments of joy that should be celebrated, community connection can make the world of difference in a family’s well-being. Parenting is tough, but everyday connections can reduce stress, isolation and feelings of judgment or shame. 
Connection is a small investment in time that can have a big impact. Consider helping a parent with their hands full of groceries and buckling seatbelts by returning their cart to the corral. Try sharing words of encouragement, not advice, to a parent at a park who is keeping their patience as their toddler tantrums. 
A simple “you’ve got this” to a parent can turn a stressful moment into a moment of connection and relief. 
As Child Abuse Prevention Month comes to a close, the Kosair for Kids Face It Movement encourages each of us to find those moments to offer support and connection so when those tough moments arise, families have resources, skills and community to lean on.

(Photo courtesy of Virginia DMV)Come May 7, your old Virginia driver’s license might not get you past airport security.
That’s the day the federal government will begin enforcing the long-delayed Real ID Act, requiring all domestic air travelers who use a driver’s license at TSA checkpoints to present a Real ID-compliant credential — or be turned away. If you don’t have one, and you’re planning to fly after that date, it’s time to act.
The Real ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005 in response to the 9/11 Commission’s call for tougher security standards on state-issued identification. Its goal is to prevent terrorists from using fake or low-security IDs to board planes or access sensitive government facilities. 
Initially, states were supposed to comply within three years. But privacy concerns, funding issues and political resistance caused years of delays. Even after all 50 states and Washington, D.C. became compliant by 2020, the Department of Homeland Security pushed back full enforcement — most recently citing a pandemic-era backlog of applications at state DMV offices.
Now, after multiple extensions, the Transportation Security Administration has set May 7, 2025, as the final deadline.
“With summer travel just around the corner, I would encourage all Virginians to take a quick look at their driver’s licenses and check for that star on the right-hand side,” U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in an email. 
“The government has been clear that folks will need a compliant license to board an airline or enter a federal facility, so don’t delay – apply for a Real ID today.”
 Virginia: A mixed bag

While more than 4.1 million Virginians have already gotten a Real ID as of early April, that still leaves over 40% of license and ID holders in the commonwealth without one, according to the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles. 
In contrast, nearby states like Maryland and the District of Columbia boast a 99% Real ID compliance rate — among the highest in the nation, Axios reported earlier this month.
Virginia DMV officials say demand has surged in recent months, with thousands of Real IDs being issued each week. But they also warn that appointments and service centers are busier than usual, and that anyone considering travel after the enforcement deadline should not wait.
“Are you flying soon? You still have time to get your REAL ID!” the agency said in a recent social media post. 
 What it means — and doesn’t

Real ID is optional in Virginia. You’re not required to have one to drive, vote, or access public benefits. But starting May 7, it will be mandatory for boarding domestic flights and entering certain federal buildings, unless you have another form of federally accepted ID, like a passport, military ID, or DHS Trusted Traveler card.
That includes military bases, which may already be rejecting licenses marked with “Federal limits apply.” Requirements vary by installation, and base visitors are encouraged to confirm what ID is accepted before showing up.
Children under 18 don’t need ID when flying domestically with an adult, but adults without a compliant license or alternative ID won’t make it past TSA.
 Getting your Real ID

The process starts online, but you’ll need to visit a DMV customer service center in person to finish the job. The fee is $10 if you’re upgrading before your license expires.
You’ll need to bring original documents — no copies allowed — proving your identity and legal presence in the U.S. That could be a birth certificate or a valid passport. You also need your full Social Security number, either on a Social Security card or a W-2 form, and two documents proving your current Virginia residency. These can include a mortgage statement, utility bill, or rental agreement.
If your legal name differs from the one on your identity documents — due to marriage or divorce, for instance — you’ll also need to bring an official name change document, such as a marriage certificate or divorce decree.
DMV officials urge residents to check their current license’s expiration date. You can renew up to one year in advance, and if your license doesn’t expire for several years, you can still come in to get a Real ID replacement.
 Why the long wait?

The Real ID rollout has taken nearly two decades to reach full enforcement. Initially set to take effect in 2008, it faced pushback over cost, state-federal tensions and fears of government overreach. 
Later, the COVID-19 pandemic created long delays and service interruptions at DMVs across the country, causing a backlog that the Department of Homeland Security cited when it postponed the May 2023 deadline to 2025.
Real ID-compliant licenses and IDs are marked with a star in the upper right-hand corner — the visual cue TSA officers will be checking for starting this spring.
 Don’t panic, but don’t delay

Travelers who don’t have a Real ID can still use a valid passport, U.S. military ID, permanent resident card, or other federally approved form of ID. A full list is available on the Virginia DMV’s Real ID FAQ page.
But DMV officials stress that getting a Real ID is the most straightforward solution for anyone who flies domestically and wants to avoid last-minute surprises at the airport.
So if you’re planning to board a plane after May 7 and your current driver’s license isn’t Real ID-compliant, the time to fix that is now. Otherwise, you may find yourself grounded — before you even get through security.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)With the 69th North Dakota Legislative Assembly finishing its business in the coming days, lawmakers elected members to the Legislative Management Committee to prepare for the next session and deal with any unfinished business.
The Legislative Management Committee has three primary roles during the interim before the 70th Legislative Assembly meets in January 2027. 
The committee decides which studies will be completed before the next legislative session and assigns them to the appropriate committees. They will appoint lawmakers to at least eight mandatory interim committees and additional committees, such as the committee tasked with being the North Dakota version of the Department of Government Efficiency, that were approved during the session. Lastly, the committee will accept the reports compiled during the interim.
John Bjornson, director of the Legislative Council, said up to 60 discretionary legislative studies and up to 15 mandatory studies are approved during each legislative session, and it will be up to the committee to whittle that down to a more manageable 45 studies in total and assign them.
“Then, they might not meet again for months,” Bjornson said.
The Legislative Management Committee also has the power to reconvene the Legislature with a majority vote, using any unused days remaining from their 80-day allotment. If Gov. Kelly Armstrong calls for a special session, the Legislature would not need to use the remaining legislative days. It’s anticipated that lawmakers may need to reconvene to address impacts from federal funding cuts.
Speaker of the House Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, said the committee also elects its own chairperson that would have additional responsibilities during the interim, such as approving requests from lawmakers to attend meetings requiring travel reimbursement and working with the Legislative Council.
“Legislative Management doesn’t have any role in funding,” Weisz said. “We have an Emergency Commission, a Budget Section that will deal with funding issues outside of session.”
Bjornson said the Legislative Management Committee is expected to meet in June to decide which studies to pursue and make interim committee appointments.
Members of the 2025-26 Legislative Management Committee are:

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Miles Borne, Alexander Muirhead, and Lila Muirhead didn’t vote in the 2024 presidential election. At the time, none of the three New Hampshire residents had turned 18.
But each will be legally old enough to vote by 2026. And they say a new state law requiring them to provide hard documentary evidence that they are citizens, such as with a passport or birth certificate, is going to “burden” their “ability to register to vote.”
Now, lawyers for the three hope a judge will agree. 
They are part of a lawsuit against the recent state law, joining a diverse group of plaintiffs that includes the Coalition for Open Democracy, the League of Women Voters of New Hampshire, the Forward Foundation, and several individuals.
The lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, alleges that House Bill 1569 is unconstitutional because it places an undue burden on voting by requiring documents that not all residents can easily access, risking disenfranchisement.
But as voting rights groups and the state of New Hampshire gird for potentially years of litigation, the plaintiffs face a more immediate question: Can they sue the state over a law that has not yet stopped them from voting?
Lawyers for the Attorney General’s Office, which is defending the law, say none of the plaintiffs — neither the prospective voters nor the organizations that say they are affected by it — are qualified to sue the state, a determination known as standing.
“Where is the direct impediment here?” Assistant Attorney General Michael DeGrandis asked in court. 
The new law took effect Nov. 11 last year, a week after the Nov. 5 presidential election, and has not yet affected any statewide elections. It was in place during the town meeting season this spring, and advocates say at least 96 people were turned away from voting as a result of not possessing the proper documentation. But so far, none of those 96 people has joined the lawsuit. 
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said under previous case law, the individuals and groups do not need to be directly disenfranchised to be harmed by the new statute.
“Those folks were injured as soon as the law was passed, as soon as the law came into effect,” Jacob van Leer, a staff attorney at the ACLU Voting Rights Project who is helping represent the plaintiffs, said at a press conference. “The urgency, I think, could not be more present here with the 2026 elections coming up.”
The arguments came to a head during a lengthy stretch of oral arguments in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire last week. Judge Samantha Elliott is considering a motion by the state to dismiss the lawsuit entirely. Part of that motion is an argument that the law has not sufficiently harmed the people suing.
The fight over the new state law, which imposes the most stringent voter registration requirements in the country, comes as Republicans are pushing similar legislation on the national stage. On April 10, the U.S. House passed the SAVE Act, which would in part require hard documentary proof of U.S. citizenship for federal elections nationwide, but the bill is likely to struggle to overcome the 60-vote requirement in the Senate to escape a filibuster. 
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump issued an executive order on March 25 that directed the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to require proof of U.S. citizenship. On Thursday, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court of Washington, D.C., granted a preliminary injunction to temporarily halt that order. 
In the New Hampshire lawsuit, the plaintiffs say the state law will affect them in multiple ways.
McKenzie Taylor, the New Hampshire state director of America Votes, an advocacy organization, got married in 2024 and changed her last name; the name on her birth certificate is St. Germain, her maiden name. As of September, when the lawsuit was filed, Taylor had not updated her name on her passport or state driver’s license. In the lawsuit, she argues the new law would require her to do so in order to vote, a financial burden.
December Rust is an unhoused man living in Littleton without a passport or access to his birth certificate, who has argued he would not be able to easily obtain it. He has also argued that because the law eliminated challenged voter affidavits — which allowed people to cast a ballot even when an election observer challenged their citizenship or other qualification at the polls — he could be targeted by a challenge with no ability to defend himself. 
Each advocacy organization involved says the new law impairs their ability to carry out their missions, which include helping residents register to vote. 
DeGrandis argued each of the people or organizations suing is flawed. He argued the organizations have not sufficiently shown that HB 1569 is a threat to their missions.
“Open Democracy isn’t turning anyone away,” he said. “They’re providing this information. And if someone doesn’t have documentation, they’re saying you need that documentation. That’s not turning someone away, that’s advising.”
And he said the individual plaintiffs have not suffered injury from the law, and especially not injury with “actual or imminent concrete and particularized harm.”
“There’s a difference between preference and injury,” DeGrandis said. “That’s why the youth plaintiffs don’t have standing. They’re engaging in speculation regarding how the remedy would operate to remedy the harm that they allege.”
Elliott appeared skeptical of that critique. 
“I’m confused as to your confusion,” she said. “They complained that they would have to bring documentation, and with the remedy, they would not need to bring documentation.”
And van Leer said the organizations faced an immediate impediment in understanding the law. “We still have no idea what it means to need other reasonable documentation proving citizenship. It makes it impossible for these organizations to provide clear voter registration services to voters when they themselves don’t know what that means.” 
Lawyers for the ACLU filed the lawsuit early, in September, in order to secure an injunction against the new law before the next statewide elections in September 2026. The timing meant that none of the plaintiffs had been directly affected by the law when it was filed. But in court, they emphasized that a law can be blocked as unconstitutional even before it has disenfranchised someone, and noted that the lawsuit could proceed even if Elliott rejects some or even most of the plaintiffs, as long as she finds that at least one has standing. 
Elliott at times appeared to agree with the argument that at least some of the plaintiffs had shown a burden. 
“The issue is: What barrier does this law impose on voting?” Elliott asked. “In this case, the barrier that it imposes is this requirement to produce the identification.”
If the SAVE Act passes the Senate and is signed by Trump, or if Trump’s executive order survives a court challenge, New Hampshire could be required to participate in a national scheme very similar to HB 1569 — and one that would supersede that law and any block on it by a court. For now, attorneys for the plaintiffs say they are pushing the attempt to stop the state law from moving ahead.
“It seems like HB 1569 is a solution in search of a problem in ways that ultimately will require individuals to scrounge together very limited forms of documentation that many folks don’t have at all, and, even more, don’t have immediate access to in order to exercise their fundamental rights,” van Leer said at the press conference.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/voteridnh-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-04-28 05:03:22.975135

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)  The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.











I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
States consider high costs, possible savings of covering weight-loss drugs for their workers

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

(Getty Images)A Louisiana lawmaker says he wants to avoid the scenario that unfolded last year in Alabama, where clinics offering in vitro fertilization closed their doors rather than risk legal liability based on a new interpretation of a 19th century law.
The matter has pitted some conservative Republicans, who normally take the same side on reproductive health issues, against one another. It also provides a glimpse into the national debate over IVF, which proponents fear could be threatened under Trump administration policy.
Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, received committee approval Tuesday for Senate Bill 156, which he said “is essential for IVF to continue in Louisiana.” But the proposal’s language had to be massaged to get the backing of one staunch anti-abortion lawmaker. Even then, the measure is still opposed by the state’s top two anti-abortion groups.
Senate Health and Welfare Committee member Rick Edmonds, R-Baton Rouge, stood firm on making a change to the definition of embryo in Pressly’s proposal. As a state representative, he authored a 2016 law to prohibit abortions for genetic abnormalities.
Originally, Pressly’s bill referred to an “in vitro fertilized human embryo” as one that “has certain rights granted by law … and organized that it may develop in utero into an unborn child.” Edmonds amended the proposal to define an embryo as “biologically human,” removing any reference to whether it actually develops into a child.
These seemingly subtle differences in language could become critical if its final version creates a situation similar to what happened last year in Alabama. Its state Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos outside the womb are considered children under the law, citing an 1872 statute that allows lawsuits for the wrongful death of a child. Fearing potential legal consequences from embryos that become nonviable – even through no fault of their own – IVF clinics in Alabama shut down.
The Alabama Legislature then scrambled to approve civil and criminal protections for IVF providers, leading clinics to reopen. There remain concerns, however, over whether long-term access will remain available.
The Trump administration’s cuts to federal health care programs have served to reinforce such worries about the future of IVF. Staff reductions at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will curtail research into IVF and other fertility treatments, experts say.
The changes have unfolded rapidly, even though Trump referred to himself as the “fertilization president” after signing an executive order last month to expand fertility treatment access. A separate order from Trump in February sought policy direction on IVF, yet Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency went ahead with the CDC attrition plans.

Anti-abortion groups back status quo
Louisiana Right to Life and Louisiana Family Forum oppose Pressly’s bill. Both groups were at the forefront of creating one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans three years ago after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. The landmark 1973 opinion declared women have a constitutional right to an abortion, but it also said states could regulate when the procedure is allowed. With the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June 2022, justices removed the federal right to an abortion and opened doors to outright state bans.
During Tuesday’s committee hearing, Pressly insisted his proposal was essential to ensure IVF remains available to 1 in 6 families that struggle with infertility, citing numbers the World Health Organization has used. It has been nearly 40 years since Louisiana has updated its IVF statute, and health technology improvements in the interim need to be reflected in the law, the senator said.
Kathleen Benfield, legislative director with Louisiana Family Forum, told the committee the Pressly proposal is unnecessary because the state’s IVF law has never been challenged.
“Not one example has been given where the practice of in vitro fertilization or any other artificial reproduction technology has been threatened (in Louisiana), and I don’t think it will be threatened,” Benfield said.
Even with Edmonds’ amendment, the bill’s language was still problematic for Benfield. She took issue with describing a “viable in vitro fertilized embryo” as a “juridical person,” or an entity that has the same rights in law as a person but is not a human being.
Put another way, Pressly’s bill doesn’t go nearly far enough to treat embryos as children, according to Benfield. A juridical person is “not the same thing as a natural person,” she said.
Last year, anti-abortion forces pushed to change to an IVF protection bill Rep. Paula Davis, R-Baton Rouge, sponsored. She shelved her bill when rather than include the term “biological human beings” in it, fearing it could lead to criminal consequences for reproductive care providers.
Davis has authored another version of her bill this year, but it has yet to be scheduled for a House committee hearing in the lawmaking session that ends June 12.
Erica Inzina, policy director for Louisiana Right to Life, said the state’s current IVF law has room for improvement, but it still offers the most protection for human embryos of any state. Pressly’s bill would weaken those safeguards, she said.
“It leaves the embryo looking a lot more like a thing rather than a person,” Inzina told the committee.
‘We’re quibbling’
The proposed changes are the product of a rather unusual partnership: Pressly, who gained approval for a first-of-its-kind abortion drug restriction; and Katie Bliss, an attorney whose firm specializes in in vitro fertilization contracts.
Pressly, who joined the Senate last year after four years as a state representative, authored a law in 2024 that treats mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances. Both medications are used in abortions but have other applications, including lifesaving ones. The Schedule IV status puts them on par with drugs that have addiction and abuse potential, meaning hospitals have to keep them under lock and key.
Some health care providers have said the added layers of security for controlled dangerous substances put women’s lives at risk when, for example, misoprostol is needed immediately to stop postpartum hemorrhaging.
Bliss has two children conceived through IVF. She said the revisions to existing law are needed to protect patients and physicians while also ensuring care for embryos.
Louisiana is the only state that’s made the destruction of embryos illegal, and conservative lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully in the past to stop patients from shipping embryos out of state for disposal. Such measures are unconstitutional, Bliss said, because one state can’t tell another state how to conduct business.
Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, attempted last year to end embryo transports across state lines, but the amendment he tried to attach to another lawmaker’s bill was ruled irrelevant to the original proposal and therefore was not allowed.
Pressly said his bill covers this scenario because it would make any IVF contract null and void if it includes a provision for the intentional destruction of an embryo.
Edmonds also objected to the removal of the terms “married couple” and “parental” from a section of existing IVF law that deals with embryo donations. Instead, “person” is used to describe an embryo donor and recipient.
Pressly told Edmonds keeping “couple” in the law could create constitutional issues, implying it conveys bias against single people who want to start a family through IVF.
“It would be hypocritical for me to vote for a bill that would eliminate parental rights,” Edmonds said, though Pressly assured him his proposal doesn’t pose that threat.
Sen. Beth Mizell, R-Franklinton, shared with other committee members that she personally had a “horrible history of miscarriages” and feared her children would have the same difficulty. Through IVF, her son and daughter-in-law have given her three of her eight grandchildren.
Mizell said she had “a hard time finding obstacles” in a bill that gives more people the opportunity to start and grow families.
“I’m listening to pro-life people argue with pro-life people,” Mizell said, who then recounted efforts during her nine years in the Senate to put strict abortion laws in place. As a result, she said Louisiana has the strongest anti-abortion laws in the nation.
“… We’re there and we’re quibbling” over language to protect IVF, she said.

For the second time in recent weeks, a North Carolina Republican judge has courageously put the constitution ahead of their political party.
First, it was Supreme Court Justice Richard Dietz who rightfully dissented when his four Republican colleagues okayed a GOP effort to change election rules after the election in last fall’s disputed Supreme Court contest.
And last week, Superior Court Judge Lori Hamilton helped strike down a law passed by the Republican-dominated legislature last fall to seize powers from Gov. Josh Stein.
The law would have placed the auditor – in effect, the state’s accountant – in charge of appointing the state Board of Elections.
In rejecting the scheme, Hamilton wrote that the duty to faithfully execute the laws has been exclusively assigned to the governor and cannot be reassigned without violating the constitution.
Good for her.
The bottom line: In this time in which a handful of politicians are trying to seize and monopolize more and more power, courageous judges are a bulwark against despotism. North Carolina is fortunate to have two of them.

Santiago/Getty Images) Ripple effects of potential federal funding cuts have been spotlighted by advocates in essentially every sector, from the overall economy to school lunches and infectious diseases. But one such potential cut, and a proposal in the Ohio House’s version of the state budget, could directly impact an issue the state has been struggling to improve for decades: infant and maternal mortality.
Ohio has been near the bottom of rankings for infant mortality rates in the country, and has seen significant maternal mortality rates as well. With children making up one-third of national Medicaid enrollment and 40% of all births in the country covered by Medicaid, cuts to that program could mean even more struggles for the state’s children and mothers.
Part of the problem that already exists within the Medicaid system, specifically in Ohio, is a low reimbursement rate that results in some physicians refusing to accept Medicaid patients, and other facilities, like Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, relying on donor support to compensate for the low reimbursement rates.
“Even when we talk about infant mortality, this Medicaid reimbursement rate is a huge factor in why the infant mortality rate is so abysmal,” said Erica Wilson-Domer, president and CEO of the greater Ohio arm of Planned Parenthood.
Of the patients who seek care from the facility, 43% are covered by Medicaid, which includes coverage for wellness exams, vaccines and cancer screenings, among other services, according to Planned Parenthood.
“I am deeply concerned about the potential cuts to Medicaid and what it will to do the overall health of Ohioans,” Wilson-Domer said.
She also pointed to rising rates of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis as a timely reason to avoid cutting public health funding. A report from the Cleveland Department of Public Health showed an increase in syphilis case rates “across all age groups,” but individuals age 30-39 had the highest case rate from 2019 to 2020.
Male Cleveland residents saw a case rate of more than 150 per 100,000 residents in 2021, and cases in women, which had previously been “stable” from 2017 to 2020 nearly doubled in 2021, according to the Cleveland report.
Loss of care
Cuts in health funding, particularly Medicaid funding could not only impact those who are covered under the program, but also medical facilities across the state, even those who may not accept Medicaid.
“If there’s lost access to preventive care, that moves care to emergency rooms,” Wilson-Domer said. “Remember, it’s more expensive to go to the ER, and these patients don’t have the ability to pay, so the burden is on the hospital.”
Those who may have commercial insurance will see impacts too, if ERs are now filled with those who no longer have Medicaid coverage. Wait times could increase for everyone, even those who go to emergency rooms for truly emergent issues, Wilson-Domer said.

State funding decisions in the Ohio House budget proposal could add to the uncertainty, as the House absorbed a proposal from Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive budget to cut Group VIII, or the Ohioans who are part of the Medicaid expansion program, if the federal contribution to Medicaid drops below 90%.
Advocates have said that will leave around 770,000 Ohioans without health insurance, leaving them with few options for care.
As discussions pop up on the federal side about encouraging women to have children through one-time funds, lowering of funding in the Medicaid program could result in more women delaying care and impacting their pregnancy because of a lack of access to the health care they need.
With the reimbursement rate low, and the potential for cuts to the state program if federal Medicaid contributions are lowered, pregnant individuals and their children could face an uncertain future.
“What ends up happening, there’s a newly pregnant person on Medicaid, but they can’t find a provider who will see them, and so they don’t end up being seen until later in the pregnancy,” Wilson-Domer said.
If the pregnant individual develops conditions like gestational diabetes or other treatable conditions, a delay in care could mean it’s too late to treat those conditions.
“If we want to really impact the maternal mortality and the infant mortality rate … what we need to do is increase the reimbursement rate so people will want to see these patients,” according to Wilson-Domer.
Reproductive health
The GOP fight over reproductive health has led to a slashing of “family planning” grants at the federal level impacting Title X funds, talk of national abortion bans, government websites on reproductive health being taken down and threats of defunding Planned Parenthood all together, which all tie in to discussions about reducing medical care for low-income families through Medicaid, according to advocates.
A study by the Gender Equity Policy Institute found that those living in states with abortion bans were nearly 2 times as likely to die during pregnancy, child birth or shortly following birth, compared to states that allow abortion.
The maternal mortality rate worsens for Black mothers in states with bans, with the GEPI finding those mothers were 3.3 times more likely to die compared with White mothers in the state.
“Even before abortion was outlawed, the states that subsequently banned abortion had worse outcomes on key indicators of reproductive health,” the GEPI stated.
Ohio couldn’t enforce the six-week ban that was put in place in 2019 because of court challenges, but once Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide, was overturned, Attorney General Dave Yost quickly sought for a court to break the ban of its court challenges, which a federal court did.
The six-week abortion ban was in effect for a short time before abortion rights advocates sued to get the ban struck down. Enforcement is currently stopped once again, after a Hamilton County Court sided with abortion clinics and advocates that the new constitutional amendment passed in November of 2023 gave abortion rights to Ohioans.
The court’s decision is currently under appeal with the First District Court of Appeals, but Yost has said he’s not appealing the decision to strike down the abortion ban, but instead argues other parts of the court decision overreach to the state laws that regulate reproductive health and abortion services.
Other provisions in Ohio law that impact abortion services have been overturned in court, like a 24-hour waiting period required before abortion services could be conducted, and another rule against virtual visits to provide medication abortion services.
Wilson-Domer said Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and their supporters “continue to bang our heads against the wall with legislators” to inform them that the health and Medicaid services dollars are “critical,” that the loss of those funds would impact all Ohioans, and that current laws that regulate such services at health clinics that also provide abortions are not only unconstitutional, but unhelpful.
“What we seek to do is provide a safe space for people to get good medical care that they need,” Wilson-Domer said.

An advocate for immigrants said it’s a bad idea to house them in facilities built for people accused of committing crimes.
Trump ran on false claims that migrants commit high rates of crime and on promises that he would deport millions. 
But mass deportations are a lot harder than Trump made it sound. And his administration is reclassifying people who came legally and asking help from local law enforcement as it tries to live up to his promises.
One way it’s done that is by signing contracts with sheriffs to house detainees in county jails. 
So far in Ohio, ICE has contracted with Seneca, Mahoning, Butler, and Geauga counties, said Lynn Tramonte of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. It has also contracted with Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio, a multi-county jail, and Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, a private prison in Youngstown, she said.
Trump might act as if it’s a crime to be in the United States without documents, but it’s not, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.
“The act of being present in the United States in violation of the immigration laws is not, standing alone, a crime,” it said in an issue brief.  “While federal immigration law does criminalize some actions that may be related to undocumented presence in the United States, undocumented presence alone is not a violation of federal criminal law. Thus, many believe that the term ‘illegal alien,’ which may suggest a criminal violation, is inaccurate or misleading.”
What is a crime is illegal entry — coming into the country without declaring it to authorities.
“Entering the United States without being inspected and admitted, i.e., illegal entry, is a misdemeanor or can be a felony, depending on the circumstances,” the ACLU said. “But many undocumented immigrants do not enter the United States illegally. They enter legally but overstay, work without authorization, drop out of school or violate the conditions of their visas in some other way. Current estimates are that approximately 45% of undocumented immigrants did not enter illegally.”
Trump is trying to deport many of those people, in addition to trying to revoke protections of those who came legally under temporary protected status, or by using the CBP 1 app. 
Tramonte said county slammers are not the place to hold migrants.
“We are literally putting people who are not charged with crimes in a criminal jail,” she said in an email. 
She listed what she believes are some of the harms: “Taking them away from their families, jobs, and communities, making them rot in jail, while their immigration cases are pending. Making it harder for them to work with lawyers and win their cases. In the United States, you can be eligible for deportation and legal status at the same time. It’s up to the courts to figure out which way to go.”
Several Ohio counties contracted with ICE to house migrants during the first Trump administration. There were some problems.
Detainees complained of mistreatment by jail staff. And at one point, the jail in Morrow County had a 100% covid infection rate.
Tramonte warned that taxpayers were on the hook to defend the lawsuits that were filed during the first Trump administration and likely would be again.

(Getty Images)Let me tell you the story of the sex raft.
Back in 1973, anthropologist Santiago Genovés conducted an astonishing social experiment. He picked a crew of men and women to pilot a custom-built raft through the Atlantic Ocean for months, beginning in Spain’s Canary Islands and ending in Mexico. Genovés sought nothing less than an understanding of fundamental human conflict, with the hopes of advancing world peace.
And goodness gracious, did he have hypotheses about what would happen.
The Guardian newspaper reported an array of his deranged thoughts: “Most conflicts are about sexual access to ovulating females.” “I believe that in a dangerous situation people will act on their instincts, and I will be able to study them.” “Maybe men will become more frustrated when women are in charge, and try to take over power.”
Genovés approached the mission with all the misguided confidence of politicos in the Kansas Statehouse and Washington, D.C. Like him, these power-hungry men believe they can manipulate and persuade members of the public into being their willing dupes. Like him, they believe they can avoid negative consequences while reaping personal benefits. Also like him, I believe they’re going to end up sorely disappointed.
To make a dramatic story short, none of Genovés’ predictions proved correct. Those on the raft, which was actually named the Acali, got along perfectly well. Crew members did have some sex, but they generally focused on survival and working together. This infuriated the researcher, who regularly tried to stir up drama on board, at one point firing the woman he had chosen as captain.
He wrote in a journal: “I can tell that violence is present deep down in their unconscious, but so far it is resting under the surface.”
Eventually, the crew rebelled. They reinstated the previous captain and Genovés fell into a deep depression, exiling himself below decks and musing about how his own desire for control had led to such a colossal failure. (He also hated the “sex raft” nickname given to the expedition by sarcastic journalists.)
What he didn’t understand was that the sex raft expedition had been a success — just not in the way he imagined. The surviving crew members told a documentarian in 2019 that they found a common cause and mission through the voyage. Some had escaped domestic violence and racism. The barely controlled environment actually gave them a supportive community. Some members apparently even considered offing Genovés together.
I’ve been thinking about the sex raft a lot lately, because I’m a sucker for hope and we’re living through less-than-hopeful times.
Maybe Kansans and Americans will fight among themselves while the country burns, not taking a moment to step back and assess the situation. Maybe elected officials and fundraisers and consultants and messaging gurus have all the information they need to perfectly manipulate us one way or another.
But perhaps not. Take property taxes. Republicans expanded their supermajorities in the House and Senate with promises to lower the sales tax burden on Kansans. What did they end up doing during the session? Next to nothing.
Members might think that Kansans weren’t watching. I can tell them firsthand that the crewmates on raft Sunflower noticed. On Thursday, Kansas Reflector staff appeared at the Trails That Connect Us event in Lawrence. The gathering featured beer, entertainment and various community organizations. I spoke at length to one reader who definitely had noticed the lack of action on property taxes.
He saw. He understood. He felt frustrated.
Likewise, Kansas politicians sent a constitutional amendment to voters that would change the selection process for Kansas Supreme Court justices. They clearly hope to reverse rulings on abortion and school finance that have forced the state to respect reproductive rights and fully fund education.
Leaders didn’t talk about the amendment that way during the session, though. They hailed voice of the people — never mind the fact that people already had their say and supported abortion access. Do they expect the crew of our Sunflower raft to sit back and listen to spin from only one side?
“We all know elections are not for sale,” Rep. Susan Humphries, R-Wichita, said during the amendment, echoing some of Genovés’ weirder proclamations.
People are smarter than officials believe. Just like the folks who navigated the Atlantic more than a half-century ago, we look out for one another. We don’t seek conflict. We want to work together.
We may disagree on matters big and small. But I like to think that if you threw us all aboard a raft, we would find a way to cooperate. We would support people who knew what they were doing. We would contribute what we could, because that’s how you survive.
And we would steer through the tumultuous waves together.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)I was born with Muscular Dystrophy, I’ve always been in a wheelchair, and I’ve always held a job. Medicaid Buy-In supports my healthcare needs and enables me to remain employed. 
Many think Medicaid is simply government-subsidized health insurance, but for me, and millions of others like me, it is so much more. It allows me to live independently in a home that I own. It pays for modifications like a ramp and roll-in shower that make life’s routines easier.   
Most importantly, Medicaid pays the wages of my caregivers who support my personal care needs and household tasks. As a 59-year old, it enables me to stay employed, leave the house, and live a fulfilling life. Without it, these things would be impossible because I would be stuck in bed with no one to care for me.   
Congress is currently considering significant cuts to Medicaid. The House and Senate have passed a joint budget resolution, calling for the House Energy and Commerce Committee to make $880 billion in cuts and the Senate Finance Committee to make $1.5 trillion in cuts to its programs – requiring large cuts to Medicaid. 
Currently, House and Senate committees are working to decide where and how much to cut. Any cuts or barriers to enrollment will have cascading impacts across the United States, putting the health and independence of Medicaid beneficiaries at risk.  
For those of us living with neuromuscular diseases, Medicaid allows us to plan for long-term care.
 If Medicaid suffers funding cuts, the consequences will be significant. We will likely face delayed treatments, be unable to afford life-saving medication, and have increased difficulty affording the homecare assistance that we need to be healthy and fulfilled. 
Medicaid is a pathway to better health outcomes, financial stability, and an overall higher quality of life. Preexisting health care issues, like lengthy home care waitlists, nursing shortages, and hospital closures are likely to follow as well, compounding the negative impacts.  
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Affordable and adequate health care is not a luxury; it’s a necessity. As the single-largest source of health insurance for Americans, it covers 72 million Americans. 
I am one of nearly 3 million Ohioans who rely on Medicaid daily. In Columbus and across Ohio’s 3rd Congressional District, where I live, 23.9% of our residents are enrolled in Medicaid — compared to the national average of 22.7%. This increased vulnerability puts many beneficiaries at risk of life-altering consequences.  
I deeply fear for the outcomes of others who depend on the service. It covers 2 in 5 adults with a disability, 2 in 5 births, and 2 in 5 children. Whether or not you are on Medicaid, chances are that someone you love needs it. 
Potential cuts will directly or indirectly impact nearly every single Ohioan. As Congress moves forward deciding what pieces of the federal budget get cut, I hope that Medicaid remains safe.  
For many Ohioans, there are no other opportunities to receive the health benefits, services, and treatments that we need besides Medicaid. If cuts are made, we will have to make difficult decisions about how to pay for the healthcare we need. 
I need Ohio U.S. Sens. Moreno and Husted to know that the lives of real Americans like me and so many others are in real danger if Medicaid budget cuts are enacted. Ohioans rely on Medicaid to live fulfilling and free lives. Please act in the best interest of those you represent.

ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Get rid of FEMA? Trump-appointed group to look at shifting disaster response to states.

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Republican legislators are attempting to prevent local and state government and law enforcement agencies from adopting policies that would restrict them from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration law.
When Rep. Michael Soboleski of Phillips presented LD 1656, which is co-sponsored by nine other Republicans, to the Judiciary Committee on Friday, he described the measure as sending “a clear message that Maine values the safety of its citizens and the partnerships that make that safety possible.” 
Those opposed to the bill argued it would subvert the balance of powers between federal and state governments and run afoul of existing state laws and the U.S. Constitution. 
If passed, government and law enforcement entities would not be able to “adopt or maintain a law, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation, policy, directive, order, practice or procedure, formal or informal, written or unwritten” that prohibits or “materially restricts” the entity from complying with or assisting in the enforcement of immigration law. 
First Maine police department joins ICE partnership

Immigration law is defined in the bill as both state or federal law relating to immigrants or immigration, including but not limited to the federal Immigration and Nationality Act. 
Among the prohibited restrictions listed in the bill are preventing participation in any program authorized under the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program. 
The Wells Police Department in York County is the only department in Maine so far to enter into an agreement for that program, which allows its officers to arrest people on immigration violations in the course of routine work, an authority previously reserved for federal agents. Some in the community are calling for the contract to be terminated. 
While the Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities, had also initially applied, the department withdrew its application due to community pushback.  
This restriction in LD 1656 appears to be in direct conflict with another bill, LD 1259, proposed by Democrats to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities.
Soboleski said inconsistent policies regarding the sharing and use of information can undermine the overarching goal of enforcing the rule of law, as an example pointing to the benefits of cooperation between state and federal agencies in combating drug trafficking along the border.
Alicia Rea, policy fellow with the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said undermining state and local governments’ power to exercise discretion about law enforcement priorities in their communities would undermine the 10th Amendment, which enshrined the principle of federalism.
Rea also argued the bill could lead to violations of the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the 14th Amendment, which addresses due process, by exposing state and local agencies to expensive litigation and potential civil liability. 
Community members request Wells Police terminate contract with ICE

Beyond official partnerships, LD 1656 would prevent state and local government and law enforcement from generally refusing to assist with immigration enforcement, preventing federal immigration officers from conducting enforcement activities in local jails and sharing information about a person’s immigration status. 
Those entities also couldn’t refuse to cooperate with an immigration detainer, defined in the bill as a “facially sufficient” request from a federal immigration agency. 
Facially sufficient, according to the bill, means either a completed, official form that indicates on its face that the agency has probable cause to believe a person is a “a removable alien” under federal immigration law, or an incomplete form that does not indicate probable cause but is supported by an administrative warrant that does. 
Unlike judicial warrants issued by a court, an administrative warrant is issued by a federal agency and does not permit authorities to enter a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy without consent. 
The top concern among Wells residents calling for the termination of the ICE contract is entangling their local police with the agency’s recent illegitimate enforcement. Rea pointed out to the committee on Friday that, according to ICE’s own records, the agency’s enforcement has not always been exact. For example, between 2008 and 2012, the agency issued detainers against 834 U.S. citizens and 28,489 legal permanent residents, or “green card” holders. 
LD 1656 would also establish a complaint process for members of the public to report any government or law enforcement entity to the state Attorney General for violating the restrictions set out in the legislation. 
If the Attorney General determines an entity is in violation, the officer would be required to issue an opinion and the entity would then have 30 days to appeal. If the Superior Court agrees with the Attorney General, it must issue an injunction and the entity would face a $500 daily fine for each day its practice remains in effect. 
The only person to testify in support of the bill on Friday, former Republican state representative Lawrence Lockman from Bradley, urged the committee to increase that penalty to $10,000 per day. 
While not opining on the immigration policy behind the bill, Julie Finn, analyst for Maine’s Judicial Branch, said the branch opposes the bill because of what she characterized as the  problematic legal process it proposes. 
It lacks an adjudicatory process, which would involve a neutral third party, Finn said. The Attorney General can only issue opinions on a question of law not on a question of fact, and only final agency action is generally appealable.  
Finn also raised concern about the bill’s ambiguity as to whether judicial marshals are included in the definition of law enforcement agency. 
She requested these positions be excluded, as their primary purpose is to provide protection and security for judicial branch employees and members of the public in a courthouse, not to investigate, apprehend people or enforce criminal violations. 
Immigration arrests in courthouses elsewhere in the country have led to growing concern that the work of local justice systems is being undermined by making immigrants fearful of coming to court. On Friday in Wisconsin, FBI agents arrested a Milwaukee County Judge, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action.
The co-sponsors of LD 1656 are Sens. Scott Cyrway and Dick Bradstreet, both representing parts of Kennebec County, and Reps. Richard Campbell of Orrington, Abigail Griffin of Levant, Gary Drinkwater of Milford, James Thorne of Carmel, Jeffrey Sean Adams of Lebanon, Katrina Smith of Palermo and Reagan Paul of Winterport.

(Stock photo by Birute/Getty Images Plus)Over 360,000 Catholics call Nebraska home. As a cradle, conflicted and often non-practicing version of that theology, I may have been part of that number. Suffice to say being contrary and asking questions is part of my DNA, a trait journalists find helpful. Perhaps not so much for those on a spiritual journey. 
Neither the current condition of my “lapseness” nor my contrarian ways matter much, however, when it’s clear that in a world awash in a rising tide of tough guys (and women) — whose dispassionate search of even greater power teems with toxicity — Pope Francis was a blessed bulwark against the further coarsening and dividing of humanity.
Most important was that he did so with grace, dignity and a sense of humor. Others may have formidable armies, the obedience of others borne of fear or the means and motives to take what they want. 
Life of service
Pope Francis had more: A true “power,” a spirit steeped in service, compassion and gentleness, a massive dose of which the world could use.
He walked the walk of gospel — perhaps his own brand of “wokeness” — focusing his servant ministry on those living on the margins of life, those with the least power, the smallest voices and the fewest options. Among them are the poorest of the poor, refugees and migrants and vulnerable members of the LGBTQ community. He preached the imperative that we must care for and restore the earth.
He famously skipped much of the papal pomp, which many of his more conservative and traditional predecessors preferred. He was also fearless in poking some of the church’s billion-plus members in their very Catholic ribs. His modern, progressive views never sat well with a number of bishops and cardinals. Nor was he averse to standing against the aforementioned world’s most powerful.
The scandal involving priests sexually abusing children changed him. By his admission, Francis said he was wrong when, on a visit to Chile, he defended an accused bishop. He apologized to the victims he slighted, set in motion an investigation, the result of which toppled the entire Chilean church leadership. Still, even though Pope Francis convened a summit of clergy in Rome to address the scandal, many believe he didn’t go far enough.
Willing to criticize
As a critic of the war in Gaza, Pope Francis’ death was barely acknowledged in official Israel, where the government offered condolences on social media, but later deleted them. Aside from being critical of Israel’s prosecution of the war, Francis suggested an investigation into Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as the war dragged on. The pope had spoken with a small community of Catholics in Gaza every evening since the war began. 
Francis also reached out to Muslim leaders, a prickly bridge too far for some among the faithful. He challenged the church’s views on the death penalty and in 2018 officially changed Catholic teaching, calling capital punishment ​“an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person,” and ​“inadmissible” in all cases. He also altered the church’s stance on nuclear weapons, deeming them immoral, yet was often silent on Russia’s invasion of and war on Ukraine.
Other detractors have argued that while he promoted women in the church, he didn’t go far enough, elevating them to leadership roles at the Vatican but stopping short of calling for their admission into the priesthood.
Surely, for some, his legacy will be mixed.
Immigration was where he was most outspoken, admonishing world leaders — including the current U.S. administration — to find solutions to the massive displacement of people around the globe consistent with not only the gospel, but more broadly simple humanity. 
Where some see migrants as parasites and pariahs, Francis saw them as human beings. During what would be his last message, he said, “How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized, and migrants! … I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!” 
I read a condolence for Pope Francis in the vast, ecumenical ethos of social media, followed immediately by a wish that his successor be anything but the aforementioned “woke.” Yes, God forbid the Vatican continue to challenge injustice, minister to outcasts and value the planet.
All of which makes me miss him already.

These are students with the most significant needs, students who deserve every opportunity to thrive, and who often rely on specialized supports to access a free and appropriate public education. Yet for years, the state and federal governments have underfunded this grant, shifting the financial burden onto local school districts and municipalities and leaving many communities struggling to meet both student needs and budget demands.
This year, the Connecticut General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee took an important step forward. The Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents (CAPSS) extends sincere thanks to Sen. Catherine A. Osten, Rep. Toni E. Walker, and members of the Appropriations Committee for voting to approve an additional $124 million in each year of the biennium for the Excess Cost Grant. If enacted by the full General Assembly, this funding would, for the first time ever, fully fund the Excess Cost Grant for the 2025 – 2026 school year.
This is not just a budget decision; it’s a moral commitment. Fully funding the Excess Cost Grant ensures that every student, regardless of ability, can access the specialized instruction and services they need. It affirms our values as a state that prioritizes equity, inclusion, and educational opportunity for all.
It also provides tangible relief to local school districts and municipalities. Special education costs are unpredictable and, in some cases, extraordinary. When the state falls short in its obligation to share these costs, districts are forced to reallocate local resources, often at the expense of other programs or services. Full funding allows district leaders to stabilize their budgets, plan more effectively, and maintain the full range of supports their students and communities require.
This has long been a top legislative priority for CAPSS, as well as for Connecticut’s Special Education Task Force. We now urge the full General Assembly to act decisively to approve this investment. Doing so would demonstrate a powerful commitment to students with disabilities, to equity in public education, and to the fiscal health of our towns and cities.
Connecticut has the opportunity to correct a longstanding funding gap and to strengthen the foundation of support for our most vulnerable learners. Let’s seize this moment and fully fund the Excess Cost Grant.

Donald Trump’s executive orders and election have removed the sense of stability and security that many, but not all Americans had become accustomed to — much in the same way that a child relies on the safety provided by his or her parents in a home that feels safe and secure.

Howard Selinger, MD
Most Americans have lived for years, secure in the knowledge that our government by design, although not always in practice for all people, respects the rule of law and operates according to ethical principles of fairness and the pursuit of the common good.
That has now changed as this Trump administration embarks on reshaping the design of government checks and balances. 
There is undoubtedly a tremendous amount of stress being generated for millions of Americans who feel threatened financially, psychologically and societally. As a family physician, I have seen what stress can do to a person’s health. Stress  not only triggers flare-ups of underlying pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, emphysema, diabetes and other medical conditions but can also trigger serious episodes of mental illness including anxiety, depression, and even promote risks to oneself or others.
This is damaging governance. Job loss threatens healthcare affordability and sustainability for the individual and at great cost to the GDP of this country of lost productivity and output, certainly at odds with this administration’s purported claim to reduce the federal deficit. We must, as stated by Abraham Lincoln, preserve government “of the people, by the people, for the people.” Attacking diversity, equity and inclusion and gender affirming care is blatantly unethical and anti-democratic.
Estimates are that nearly 200, 000 individuals or four percent of the federal workforce will have their jobs terminated. Law allows for only 31 days of continued health coverage after job termination. Further maintenance of federal employee health benefits requires the individual to pay both the worker’s share and the government’s share  which would cost the employee for family coverage over $1,800 per month which is out of reach for most Americans.   
This federal behavior will inevitably harm our most vulnerable citizens.
Longer term, the threatened defunding of the Department of Education , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Institutes of Health “indirect funding” support for critical healthcare research will degrade the health of our nation. Imagine handicapping the CDC’s ability to prepare for future pandemics, or to identify and prevent widespread food source contamination. State Medicaid programs have been targeted for significant funding reductions that will potentially cause millions of low-income and disabled Americans to lose their health coverage.
It is always the goal to deliver high-value healthcare and avoid unnecessary expenses. We teach this every day as we train future family physicians.
In the beloved story “A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens, Scrooge states that regarding the vulnerable population, “If they would rather die, they had better do it and decrease the surplus population.” This callousness is reflected in our present day presidential leadership. 
Diversity, equity, inclusion and the common good are the pillars of our democratic culture. We MUST raise our voices again and again to preserve these ideals. There is no other alternative.

Throughout the state, it is apparent that the ghosts of Connecticut’s industrial past remain. They loom over communities and are usually abandoned, dilapidated, and contaminated. The presence of these vacated sites creates environmental issues and safety hazards, and most importantly, they do not fix themselves. As Connecticut’s economy has shifted away from manufacturing textiles, firearms, clocks, and hardware, these crumbling structures are left behind.


These former factories, warehouses, and industrial properties are known as brownfields. A brownfield is a term for abandoned or underutilized sites that have yet to be redeveloped due to the presence or potential presence of pollution in the building, soil, and groundwater. These sites require investigation or remediation before development. 
In the past decade, Connecticut has focused more and more on brownfield redevelopment and understanding the importance of refurbishment. These sites, along with the effects they impose on communities across the state, create numerous issues. These issues range from environmental contamination problems of soil, groundwater, and pollutants to various social and economic issues like deterrence of investments, job creation, and reduced property values.

Jack Lambros
Connecticut’s initiative to redevelop brownfield properties is both an environmental plan and an innovative economic strategy. It aims to improve neglected urban spaces, attract businesses, create housing, and provide open spaces for the community.
This also revitalizes local economies and generates tax revenue, so why does this seem too good to be true? The cost.
The redevelopment of brownfields in Connecticut faces many obstacles because of cost. Most importantly, the environmental cleanup required to decontaminate these sites substantially heightens remediation costs. To ensure and prioritize safety, Connecticut enforces high regulatory standards even after a project’s completion, resulting in higher costs. The truth is, these buildings are so old that they remember when the term “environmentally friendly” meant we dumped it behind the factory, so significant cleanup is a prerequisite to development. 
A direct example of this issue is the setbacks in the plan for a new soccer stadium in Bridgeport. This plan envisions a brand-new 7,500-seat stadium and housing, a hotel, retail stores, and restaurant spaces. Due to the site’s former tenant, the AGI rubber factory, anticipation of soil contamination is expected, potentially requiring the soil to be removed entirely or rendered inaccessible. 
This is a challenging and costly project that will likely delay  the opening and projected spring 2026 kickoff for CT United FC.  
The Connecticut DECD is providing $8 million to expedite the process, and the 2025 session of the Connecticut General Assembly is working on the quest for an unspecified amount of state aid. The legislature aims to have a financial commitment by June, but will this be enough to make this vision a reality?
In December, Governor Ned Lamont announced state grants for brownfield remediation projects statewide under the Brownfield Municipal Grant Program. The Department of Economic and Community Development’s Office of Brownfield Remediation and Development supports the grant program, providing approximately $20 million in funding to redevelop 21 properties in 18 municipalities across the State.
State investments have leveraged roughly $530 million in private investments, facilitating the creation of 1,392 new housing units and new businesses. 
Successful examples of remediation include the Colt Armory in Hartford. The former firearms manufacturer from the 19th century was abandoned for decades in Hartford’s Charter Oak neighborhood. Over six years, between 2015 and 2021, the Colt Gateway Apartments demonstrated the successes of remediation. Developers combined historical charm and character with contemporary living and commercial space, revitalizing the neighborhood into a vibrant community through the support of DECD funding. 
The paramount issue for brownfield redevelopment remains the need for increased and consistent funding. Without a reliable and substantial flow of funding, municipalities and developers face many obstacles, stalling redevelopment projects. 
The Connecticut State Legislature introduced Senate Bill 1403, for addressing the cost issue of  remediation within the state. The bill’s objective is to gather data and insights that can be used to guide future policies and initiatives on brownfield sites. The bill appears to have gained support so far, but it still seems to face scrutiny because of flaws in the allocation of resources and the overall effectiveness of proposed solutions. In the end, this bill needs the public’s support to confront the challenges that brownfields create because it is a proactive and progressive step toward the future of Connecticut’s economic development. 
Brownfield redevelopment is needed to attract business, create housing, and revitalize communities in Connecticut’s post-pandemic world. This redevelopment initiative is an investment in the future of Connecticut, while solving environmental problems and eliminating community health hazards. By transforming liabilities into community assets, and economic growth, it is a creative initiative to rethink what is needed to incentivize businesses and residents of Connecticut.

There was a multibillion-dollar budget deficit to solve. Sharp debate on parental rights and capping rent increases. Clashes over tax policy. Tensions between the new Democratic governor and legislators in his own party. And the unexpected deaths of a sitting senator and a former House speaker.
“I’ll say certainly today, it feels like the toughest one that I’ve been through,” House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, said at a post-session news conference.
Washington lawmakers wrapped up around 6 p.m. Sunday. They spent their final day approving new two-year budgets for the state’s day-to-day operations, transportation system and capital construction.
They also put the finishing touches on two of the year’s most hotly debated pieces of legislation, one to cap residential rent increases and another delaying closure of the Rainier School, a rehabilitation center in Pierce County for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, who took office in January, applauded moves from state lawmakers to increase education funding, provide his demanded $100 million to hire more police, preserve the state’s rainy day fund, narrow their tax platform, and accept many of his proposed budget savings.
But Ferguson, who did not speak to reporters after the session adjourned, stopped short of a full-throated endorsement.
“I look forward to carefully reviewing the budgets line by line over the next few weeks,” the Democratic governor said in a statement late Sunday. “When that review is complete, I will share my thoughts with the public in greater detail.”
Budget troubles
The largest hurdle lawmakers faced entering the session was writing the next two-year budget. They knew months of lower-than-expected tax collections and an inflation-driven surge in costs were going to leave less money than needed to maintain existing levels of service.
What emerged, and cleared the House and Senate on partisan votes, is a two-year $77.8 billion budget that is balanced with spending cuts and billions of dollars in new and higher taxes.
“Reductions are hard. Revenue is hard. This budget is a combination of hard and difficult choices,” Fitzgibbon said ahead of its passage in the House.
The tax package Democrats assembled totals around $9.4 billion over four years. Much of that money — around $5.6 billion — will come from increases in the state’s main business tax. There’s also a higher rate added to the state’s capital gains tax for gains above $1 million.
Republicans in both chambers assailed the tax hikes and insisted Democrats could have written a balanced budget without them.
“When we started this session, all I heard about was making the wealthy pay their fair share,” said Rep. April Connors, R-Kennewick. “This budget spreads taxes across all working Washington residents in a manner that is going to make this state more and more and more unaffordable to live in. This budget does not fix Washington, it hurts Washington.”
A coalition of business groups also slammed Democrats over taxes, saying they were “deeply disappointed.”
“These costs simply can’t be absorbed by businesses — they will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for everyday goods and services,” said Kris Johnson, president and CEO of the Association of Washington Business. 
State employee unions scored wins, with lawmakers foregoing plans for furloughs floated earlier in the session and commitments in the budget to support new collective bargaining agreements that will provide 5% pay raises over two years.
Roads, rent and guns
On a bipartisan note, the House and Senate easily passed a $15.5 billion, two-year transportation funding plan, earmarking money for state ferries, highway megaprojects and much more. That plan hinges in part on a 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax that would take effect July 1, and a raft of other tax and fee hikes. 
More than one-third of the overall sum is set aside for road improvements, allowing the state to finish some of its biggest undertakings, like the North Spokane Corridor and State Route 520. Another $895 million is set to pay for new state ferries, terminal improvements and existing vessel preservation. And the court-ordered removal of barriers to fish migration gets $1.1 billion.
“This budget keeps Washington’s roads, bridges and highways remaining safe and functional,” said House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma. “It supports the state ferry system and improves reliability. It makes commitments to repair culverts and protect Washington waterways.”
The funding plan is a leap from $13.2 billion for transportation in the current biennium set to end June 30.
In his statement, Ferguson applauded the transportation investments, but was silent on the new revenue that would help pay for them.
And in unanimous votes, lawmakers approved a separate $7.5 billion for infrastructure projects, including record investments in affordable housing as well as money for K-12 school construction, salmon recovery and behavioral health facilities.
Progressive Democrats scored some long-sought victories, pushing through the bill that will limit annual rent increases for many tenants across Washington, capping hikes at 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. A bill to provide up to six weeks of unemployment insurance benefits for striking workers also made it through. 
Legislation to require a new state permit to buy guns is poised for action from the governor, too. The state would join about a dozen others with similar gun control laws.
One of the more fiery conflicts had to do with the rights of public school students and their parents. Democrats led an effort to overhaul a citizen initiative on parental rights the Legislature approved last year. They said this was needed to clarify language in the earlier measure and align it with other federal and state laws. Republicans said it was an attempt to gut the initiative.
Wealth tax gets a vote
Progressives in the Senate got their long-awaited opportunity to argue for and pass legislation to tax the financial assets of wealthy individuals — knowing full well the bill would not reach the governor, who is not a fan.
The legislation to establish a wealth tax passed on a 26-21 vote. The House did not debate the bill.
Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, the bill’s sponsor, said taxing those with more than $50 million in certain assets like stocks and bonds “is constitutionally compliant and a sound policy,” a seeming swipe at Ferguson, who has questioned the novel tax’s ability to withstand a legal challenge.
Ferguson’s opposition forced Democrats to axe the wealth tax from their tax package.
“I think we have shown the people of Washington state what is possible,” Frame said. “I hope we will return to that soon.”
Solemn ending
This year’s session was enveloped in sadness.
Two political legends, former Secretary of State Ralph Munro, a Republican, and former House Speaker Frank Chopp, a Democrat, died days apart in late March.
Then, on April 19, Bill Ramos, a first-term Democratic state senator, died while on a run near his Issaquah home.
And Saturday afternoon, the wife of state Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, died following a medical emergency at her workplace.
On Sunday, senators honored Ramos in an hourlong, emotion-packed tribute as House members watched from the gallery. Ramos had served in the House before winning his Senate seat in November. The tribute ended with a special roll call including his name.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2177-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-27 23:59:41.297003

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)A highly contested bill around the closure of a residential center for people with disabilities passed the Washington state House and Senate this weekend with mixed support from lawmakers and some major changes.  
Senate Bill 5393 intended to shutter Rainier School, a rehabilitation center in Pierce County for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, by June 30, 2027.
But a Republican amendment approved on the House floor, and agreed to by the Senate, will instead prohibit new long-term admissions starting July 27 this year and stop short-term admissions starting June 30, 2027.
Under the amended version, the center would close when there are no more long-term residents. Former long-term residents would have the ability to return within one year of transitioning out of the center. 
The rewrite gained some Republican support but lost some among Democrats. 
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, was one of the lawmakers concerned that the bill was rushing the closure and didn’t have enough safeguards. He and other GOP legislators walked out of a House committee hearing this week when the panel advanced the legislation. 
After the amendment, he felt better about the bill, even though he still voted against it.
“This is a pill I can swallow,” Couture said. 
The bill would also require the Department of Social and Health Services to provide regular reports to the Legislature until June 1, 2030, and offer residents the choice of alternative placements with careful planning. 
It now heads to Gov. Bob Ferguson’s desk. 
Debates around the closure of the Rainier School and the similar Yakima Valley School have been a hot topic in the Legislature this session.
Rainier School has faced scrutiny in recent years over incidents of abuse, neglect and safety lapses. Some disability rights advocates have pushed for its closure.
The facilities are also expensive, with a year of services for a patient at Rainier running around $775,000. Proponents of closing them said it could allow for resources to be shifted in a way that gives people improved options for services and reduces costs for the state.
“This isn’t about buildings or dollars, this is about the people who live at Rainier, people who have been hurt, forgotten, ignored, and betrayed,” said Rep. Darya Farivar, D-Seattle.
 “If home means fear, being silenced, bruised, and even death, we have an obligation to show some better options,” Farivar added.
But Republicans argued that centers like Rainier provide a crucial form of services and care and that people would be left with few nearby options if the center were to close. 
Workers at the facilities also opposed the closure plans.
In 2017, the Legislature passed a bill that would close the Yakima Valley School once the number of permanent residents had dwindled to eight people. There are roughly 36 long-term residents at the center, according to figures presented to lawmakers. 
A House bill that stalled this year proposed closing both the Rainier and Yakima Valley schools by June 30, 2027.

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Washington is poised to limit annual residential rent increases with legislation now headed to the governor’s desk.
The House and Senate on Sunday, the last day of the legislative session, passed the rent increase limit at 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. Landlords could still set rent however they please when a tenancy begins.
Rent increases for manufactured homes are limited to 5% under House Bill 1217. While the rent cap policy on traditional homes would expire after 15 years, the manufactured home rule wouldn’t lapse.
The final version was a compromise after moderate Democrats in the Senate wouldn’t go along with the initial 7% cap, without inflation, the House had approved. 
Landlords also couldn’t raise rents in the first year of a tenancy under the proposed law. If a landlord violates the provisions, tenants or the state attorney general could bring litigation.
Buildings owned by nonprofits or public housing authorities would be exempt from the limits. The same goes for duplexes, triplexes or fourplexes if the owner lives in one of the units, as well as new construction for its first dozen years.
Republicans argue the bill will chill development and price landlords out of the business. Most Democrats say it’ll give renters a modicum of predictability as they deal with the high cost of living. 
The Senate approved the bill on a 27-20 vote, with Democratic Sens. Annette Cleveland and Sharon Shewmake joining Republicans in opposition. The House vote was 54-44. Five Democratic representatives opposed the final bill. 
It was a long and windy road to Sunday’s votes.
After stalling in the Senate last year, lawmakers came into 2025 energized to enshrine House Bill 1217 into law. But after passing the House, the Senate, in dramatic fashion, lifted the cap from the initial 7% to 10% plus inflation and exempted many single-family homes entirely, moves advocates said “gutted” the proposal.
In negotiations, Democrats in both chambers agreed to excise the carveout and find a middle ground on the limit.
But when the new iteration landed on the Senate floor Friday night, lawmakers were thwarted by a procedural snafu that delayed votes a couple more days.
The compromise frustrated advocates, but they said it was better than nothing.
“Even a 7% rent increase will force some people to move, disrupting their lives and their communities, and some will have no option but to move into cars, shelters, or tents,” said Michele Thomas, of the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance. “But this bill makes a first step towards sensible protections against egregious predatory rent increases.”
Gov. Bob Ferguson has repeatedly declined to weigh in on the legislation. 
He told reporters Friday that he recognizes “the different perspectives that different folks within the caucuses have, and so we’re trying to be helpful on that and I feel optimistic that they’re going to work something out,” but stopped short of saying what he hoped that resolution would be.
Once the bill reaches his desk, Ferguson has 20 days, excluding Sundays, to act on it. If he signs, the policy would go into effect immediately.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_4915-Large-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-27 17:02:29.820883

You can read more about the section here.

Each year, in a handful of states, public offices close, flags are lowered and official ceremonies commemorate “Confederate Memorial Day.”
Mississippi is among those handful of states that on Monday will celebrate the holiday intended to honor the soldiers who fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War.
But let me be clear: celebrating Confederate Memorial Day is not only racist but is bad policy, bad governance and a deep stain on the values we claim to uphold today.
First, there is no separating the Confederacy from the defense of slavery and white supremacy. The Confederacy was not about “states’ rights” in the abstract; it was about the right to own human beings. Confederate leaders themselves made that clear.
Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens declared in his infamous “Cornerstone Speech” that the Confederacy was founded upon “the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man.” No amount of revisionist history can erase the fact that the Confederacy’s cause was fundamentally rooted in preserving racial subjugation.
To honor that cause with a state holiday is to glorify a rebellion against the United States fought to defend the indefensible. It is an insult to every citizen who believes in equality and freedom, and it is a cruel slap in the face to Black Americans, whose ancestors endured the horrors of slavery and generations of systemic discrimination that followed.
Beyond its moral bankruptcy, Confederate Memorial Day is simply bad public policy. Holidays are public statements of our values. They are moments when a state, through official sanction, tells its citizens: “This is what we believe is worthy of honor.” Keeping Confederate Memorial Day on the calendar sends a message that a government once committed to denying basic human rights should be celebrated.
That message is not just outdated — it is dangerous. It nurtures the roots of racism, fuels division and legitimizes extremist ideologies that threaten our democracy today.
Moreover, there are real economic and administrative costs to shutting down government offices for this purpose. In a time when states face budget constraints, workforce shortages and urgent civic challenges, it is absurd to prioritize paid time off to commemorate a failed and racist insurrection. Our taxpayer dollars should be used to advance justice, education, infrastructure and economic development — not to prop up a lost cause of hate.
If we truly believe in moving forward together as one people, we must stop clinging to symbols that represent treason, brutality and white supremacy. There is a legislative record that supports this move in a veto-proof majority changing the state Confederate flag in 2020. Taking Confederate Memorial Day off our official state holiday calendar is another necessary step toward a more inclusive and just society.
Mississippi had the largest population of enslaved individuals in 1865 and today has the highest percentage of Black residents in the United States. We should not honor the Confederacy or Confederate Memorial Day. We should replace it.
Replacing a racist holiday with one that celebrates emancipation underscores the state’s rich African American history and promotes a more inclusive understanding of its past. It would also align the state’s observances with national efforts to commemorate the end of slavery and the ongoing pursuit of equality.
I will continue my legislative efforts to replace Confederate Memorial Day as a state holiday with Juneteenth, which commemorates the freedom for America’s enslaved people.
It’s time to end Confederate Memorial Day once and for all.

As many parents will know, research points to several negative effects of screen time. As scholars who specialize in speech pathology and early childhood development, we are particularly interested in the recent finding that too much screen time is associated with less parent-child talk, such as fewer conversational turns between parents and children.
As a result, the American Academy of Pediatrics and World Health Organization suggest limiting screen time for children. 
Beyond quantity, they also emphasize the quality of a child’s engagement with digital media. Used in moderation, certain kinds of media can have educational and social benefits for children – and even contribute to language development.
These tips may help parents structure and manage screen time more effectively.
 No. 1: Choose high-quality content

Parents can enhance their children’s screen-time value by choosing high-quality media – that is, content with educational benefit. PBS Kids has many popular shows, from “Nature Cat” to “Sid the Science Kid,” that would qualify as educational.
Two other elements contribute to the quality of screen time.
First, screen content should be age-appropriate – that is, parents should choose shows, apps and games that are specifically designed for young children. Using a resource such as Common Sense Media allows parents to check recommended ages for television shows, movies and apps.
Second, parents can look for shows that use evidence-based educational techniques, such as participatory cues. That’s when characters in shows break the “third wall” by directly talking to their young audience to prompt reflection, action or response. Research shows that children learn new words better when a show has participatory cues – perhaps because it encourages active engagement rather than passive viewing.
Many classic, high-quality television shows for young children feature participatory cues, including “Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,” “Dora the Explorer,” “Go Diego Go!” and “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood.”
 No. 2: Join in on screen time

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents and children watch media together whenever possible.
This recommendation is based on the evidence that increased screen media use can reduce parent-child conversation. This, in turn, can affect language development. Intentionally discussing media content with children increases language exposure during screen time.
Parents may find the following joint media engagement strategies useful:

Press pause and ask questions.
Point out basic concepts, such as letters and colors.
Model more advanced language using a “think aloud” approach, such as, “That surprised me! I wonder what will happen next?”

 No. 3: Connect what’s on screen to real life

Learning from media is challenging for young children because their brains struggle to transfer information and ideas from screens to the real world. Children learn more from screen media, research shows, when the content connects to their real-life experiences.
To maximize the benefits of screen time, parents can help children connect what they are viewing with experiences they’ve had. For example, while watching content together, a parent might say, “They’re going to the zoo. Do you remember what we saw when we went to the zoo?”
This approach promotes language development and cognitive skills, including attention and memory. Children learn better with repeated exposure to words, so selecting media that relates to a child’s real-life experiences can help reinforce new vocabulary.
 No. 4: Enjoy screen-free times

Ensuring that a child’s day is filled with varied experiences, including periods that don’t involve screens, increases language exposure in children’s daily routines.
Two ideal screen-free times are mealtimes and bedtime. Mealtimes present opportunities for back-and-forth conversation with children, exposing them to a lot of language. Additionally, bedtime should be screen-free, as using screens near bedtime or having a TV in children’s bedrooms disrupts sleep.
Alternatively, devoting bedtime to reading children’s books accomplishes the dual goals of helping children wind down and creating a language-rich routine.
Having additional screen-free, one-on-one, parent-child play for at least 10 minutes at some other point in the day is good for young children. Parents can maximize the benefits of one-on-one play by letting their children decide what and how to play.
A parent’s role here is to follow their child’s lead, play along, give their child their full attention – so no phones for mom or dad, either – and provide language enrichment. They can do this by labeling toys, pointing out shapes, colors and sizes. It can also be done by describing activities – “You’re rolling the car across the floor” – and responding when their child speaks.
Parent-child playtime is also a great opportunity to extend interests from screen time. Including toys of your child’s favorite characters from the shows or movies they love in playtime transforms that enjoyment from screen time into learning.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Megan Cantone stumbled out of the hospital in tears from the pain.
She sought treatment for an infection from drug use. Medical professionals at the Denver hospital provided the treatment, but as Cantone recalls, it came with a heavy dose of judgment.
A doctor refused to numb her wound after recognizing it as being from illicit drug use, she said. The pain was supposed to convince her “never to shove a needle in your arm again,” Cantone said.

“I told my husband I feel like a complete failure, like a terrible person,” Cantone said. “That’s almost when a person could kill themselves because you’re at the lowest of your low and somebody treats you like that.”
Earlier that week, a nurse at a different hospital confronted her while treating another infection. The nurse told Cantone she’d end up killing herself and “pretty much told me I was disgusting,” Cantone remembers. 
Cantone began experimenting with drugs in high school, but her opioid use started when she attended cosmetology and esthiology school in the Twin Cities. Her use escalated to meth and heroin over the years.
A doctor stepped in to defend Cantone, scolding the nurse. The doctor suggested medication to help her stop opioid use; he said she suffered from a medical disorder that could be treated.
As the opioid epidemic continues in South Dakota, physicians can offer medications for opioid use disorder. But the practice — made possible by a change to federal law in 2022 — is held back in South Dakota because of stigmas attached to it, advocates say. Stigmas like Cantone experienced, and what she still experiences in South Dakota today.

Cantone didn’t accept the medication from the emergency room doctor. She grappled with self-loathing. But the doctor’s kindness and offer stuck with her.
Months later, after near-death experiences and the realization she was pregnant, Cantone accepted a prescription and delivered a healthy baby girl. The medication straightened a winding path toward recovery.
The 35-year-old mother and wife, who lives in Sioux Falls, credits her Christian faith and the medication for her recovery. She will celebrate six years of sobriety in May.
Training providers to ‘recognize bravery’
Buprenorphine prescriptions in South Dakota tripled in the last five years, increasing from about 2,500 at the start of 2019 to around 7,500 at the end of 2024. The drug reduces opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings.
Naloxone is available in some public spaces throughout South Dakota, especially in Sioux Falls and Rapid City. It prevents opioid overdoses by blocking receptor cells.

Cantone took a Suboxone prescription for years, which is a drug that contains both buprenorphine and naloxone to treat opioid use disorder. Now she takes buprenorphine.
The increased access to both medications is heartening for Craig Uthe, a family physician at Sanford and local spokesman for the national Opioid Response Network. The Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act eliminated a federal waiver requirement for prescribing buprenorphine. But physicians need more education on the prescriptions, he said.
“We didn’t have that many people prescribing buprenorphine before, and we still don’t,” Uthe said. “We have a lot of people still prescribing opioids but not prescribing buprenorphine.”
Opioids are prescribed for pain management but can be addictive, especially for patients with chronic pain, Uthe said. South Dakota opioid prescription counts in 2024 stood at 437,431.
Of the top 10 controlled substances prescribed to South Dakota patients in 2024, opioids claimed three spots, according to the state’s prescription drug monitoring program data. Two of the three drugs — methylphenidate and oxycodone — moved up in the rankings to fourth and sixth most prescribed controlled substances. Hydrocodone retained its number one spot.
The state and health systems are gathering data to measure how much buprenorphine is prescribed.
“If we see a county with high overdose numbers, we’d like to see a higher amount of buprenorphine prescribed,” Uthe said. “How can we, as the state Health Department or as health care systems, try to place a resource where there is the greatest need?”

South Dakota Health Department Secretary Melissa Magstadt said medical providers should make it a “prescribing habit” to prescribe naloxone for each opioid prescription they write. Overdose victims do not always suffer from opioid use disorder, she said.
“I’ve seen very well-meaning patients who took one too many doses or maybe forgot they took a dose or didn’t realize they had two different medications that had opioids in them,” Magstadt said.
She said it’ll likely take years for prescriber behaviors to change.
In 2023, South Dakota reported the second lowest overdose death rate in the nation at 11.2 deaths per 100,000 residents, according to the latest data available.
Ninety-five South Dakotans in 2023 died from drug overdoses, 47 of which were from opioids. In 2024, 90 South Dakotans died from drug overdoses, 36 of which were from opioids, according to the state Health Department.
Although most overdose deaths are among white residents, Native Americans are disproportionately affected. Native Americans die from overdoses at a rate of 26.6 per 100,000 — more than four times the rate among white South Dakotans, according to the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System.
Sioux Falls nonprofit Emily’s Hope partners with emergency departments. Physicians connect patients with the nonprofit, which works to connect them to medication and other treatment services, said Angela Kennecke, founder and CEO. Kennecke’s daughter, Emily, died of a fentanyl overdose, laced in heroin she injected. Her family was planning to enroll her into a treatment program when she died in May 2018.

Medication is the “gold star” for treatment, Kennecke said. Treating opioid use disorder without medication can be more harmful than no treatment, according to a Yale study published in the Drug and Alcohol Dependence journal in 2024. 
“That is our first line of defense in getting people to feel better, to reduce cravings and get them the help they need,” Kennecke said.
Loretta Bryan, a registered nurse focused on clinical improvement within the South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations, educates medical providers on opioid use disorder, medications and how to engage with patients.
Her work focuses on “motivational interviewing techniques” to create authentic conversations with patients and improve screening.
“It takes a lot of bravery to walk through those doors and admit you’re struggling,” Bryan said. “Finding those words to recognize that bravery and having those in your back pocket is helpful.”
Expanding opioid use disorder treatment infrastructure
Access to medications for opioid use disorder is growing in clinics across the state, but not as fast as needed, Uthe said. The focus remains in emergency rooms and on harm reduction. Aside from clinics dedicated to behavioral health, Uthe said, family physicians and urgent care doctors should be comfortable prescribing the medications.
“We don’t have the infrastructure in place to address that need at the moment,” he said.
Lewis and Clark Behavioral Health Services in Yankton runs a telehealth behavioral health program focused on opioid use, with two outreach sites in Pierre and Huron. Rapid City-based Project Recovery is an addiction recovery clinic for opioids, alcohol and stimulant use with satellite clinics in Sioux Falls, Sisseton and Pine Ridge.

State funds to combat opioid use in the state support both programs.
Kendra Joswiak, clinical practice director at Project Recovery, said the organization treated 1,100 people for opioid use disorder in 2024. Of those treated without medication, about 90% will use again, she said, comparing medication for opioid use disorder to insulin for diabetes patients.
“If we had something as good for cancer as we do for opioid use disorder, we’d say we cured cancer,” Joswiak said.
Patients continue to face stigma after years of sobriety
Cantone continues to feel judged when she shares her history with medical professionals, pharmacists, friends and family.
She felt “icky” when she first ordered her prescription at a pharmacy when she moved back to South Dakota in 2020. Medication for opioid use disorder isn’t as common or well known in South Dakota as it is in Denver, she said.
“They looked at me like I was a drug addict or from Mars,” she recalled.
Friends and family have told her she’s switching one addiction for another. But medical professionals say the prescription drugs help restore balance to parts of the brain affected by addiction, allowing patients’ brains to heal without cravings or withdrawal symptoms.
The doubt and stigma undercut the pride and hard work it took to earn Cantone’s sobriety. But she knows people who struggle with substance use disorder are more than what others see.
“As much as we worry about what others think, what matters is you being healthy, getting your life together, staying alive and getting the help you need,” Cantone said. “Whether it’s medication or counseling or cutting cold turkey. You need to get yourself better and cancel out that noise.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/591A9544-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-27 13:08:37.307051

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Shame consumed Cameron Nielson as he lay curled and shaking on an emergency room bed.
Nurses shouldn’t have to rush to care for him, he thought. Other patients deserved attention more than him. This was his seventh relapse.
His mother drove him to the emergency room with severe withdrawal symptoms from opioids and Xanax last summer after his drugs were stolen from his safe, he said.

“I hated myself,” the 27-year-old Sioux Falls resident remembered.
He accepted medication from one of the nurses to stop the withdrawal symptoms. His head was clearer and he could fall asleep, but the shame remained.
Vanessa Needles entered the room after he woke up. She wasn’t a nurse, but a peer support specialist meant to connect Nielson to resources. His shame turned to embarrassment, but it soon became gratitude for the medical staff and Needles.
Needles spoke his language in a way the nurses and doctors surrounding him couldn’t. She overdosed once herself and struggled with alcohol use, eventually leading to a car crash that killed her coworker in 2017. Needles and Nielson started experimenting with drugs and alcohol around 14 years old. They’d both done things and treated their loved ones in ways they regret. He wasn’t alone.
Needles, who is seven years sober, offered Nielson grace. 
“When you’re trying to get off of it, the littlest thing makes the biggest difference,” Nielson told South Dakota Searchlight. “The most valuable thing is having someone understand what you’re going through.”

Needles is one of nine peer support specialists in eastern South Dakota with Sioux Falls-based nonprofit Emily’s Hope. Their work is part of a pilot program overseen by the state Department of Social Services and launched in January 2024 to reduce overdoses by providing “essential supports and strengthening connections” to local resources, according to a statement from the department. Rapid City-based Project Recovery piloted the program in western South Dakota.
The pilots are funded by national opioid settlement dollars, costing $346,445. The national opioid settlement was reached in 2021 to resolve opioid litigation against the country’s three largest pharmaceutical distributors and one manufacturer. More than $50 billion in settlement funds are being delivered to state and local governments from the companies accused of flooding communities with opioid painkillers even though they allegedly knew how addictive and deadly the drugs were. South Dakota is set to receive $54 million of settlement funding within the next two decades.
The department plans to continue funding the program with settlement dollars through 2029, based on a plan presented to the opioid advisory council in April.
What is the program?
The two organizations received a combined 34 referrals since the program’s launch and connected with 26 people to provide resources. Between 2016 and 2020, there were more than 2,400 drug-related hospitalizations and 684 drug-related deaths in South Dakota.
Angela Kennecke, founder and CEO of Emily’s Hope, said the organization works closely with emergency room departments for referrals. Sometimes the initial contact yields later results. One woman who ended communication with a peer support specialist last year picked communication back up this year to seek help.
“I always say a seed is planted,” Kennecke said. “Even if they don’t go into treatment immediately or they don’t go on medication and get the help they need, a seed has been planted that there is someone there to help them when they’re ready.”

Kennecke’s daughter, Emily, died of a fentanyl overdose, laced in heroin she injected. Her family was planning to enroll her into a treatment program when she died in May 2018.
Project Recovery has found most of its success working with Rapid City’s Fusion Center, which is a law enforcement task force. The clinic receives referrals based on overdose data collected by law enforcement. Kendra Joswiak, clinical practice director at Project Recovery, said her response team connected with 82% of activations, 56% of which continue to be engaged in addiction service treatments.
Needles, a 30-year-old mother of two — soon to be three — served as a peer support specialist for years in other capacities before working with Emily’s Hope to meet with overdose victims in the emergency room. She’s previously talked with people struggling with substance use on the street, and she’s shared her story with jail inmates.
The program bridges gaps in South Dakota’s behavioral health infrastructure, she said. It also destigmatizes substance use within the medical profession and in the community, and gives a sense of purpose to those in recovery.
“By helping someone stay sober, I stay sober another day,” Needles said. “I can stand in front of them and tell them that this is scary and sh—y, but that it’s going to get better.”
Peer support specialists with Emily’s Hope receive a group text when an overdose victim arrives at a Sioux Falls-area hospital. Whoever is available goes, Needles said.
Most of the time, people have already checked out of the hospital before a specialist arrives. She remembers when she overdosed a decade ago, and she left the hospital as soon as she could because she was scared. She needed to cope with her emotions, and the only way she knew how was to use again.
She and other peer support specialists will follow up with patients after they leave the hospital, dropping off bags of fentanyl test strips or medication to prevent overdose. She’ll hand them to the patient, parents or spouses — whoever she can find.
‘Everybody deserves a little bit of grace’
After Nielson was admitted to the hospital and into a treatment program through Avera Health, Needles joined him each Friday. She checks in on him to see how he’s feeling and has taken him to support meetings since he completed treatment. She sent him a coin and card when he reached three months of sobriety late last year.

Nielson is eight months sober. He’s taking a Suboxone prescription to eliminate cravings, and he feels more like himself, he said. He started reading again, hasn’t missed a day of work and spends time with his 3-year-old son each week. It’s something he couldn’t have dreamed of a decade ago.
Needles’ guidance and support reminds Nielson he’s not alone and what he’s capable of achieving.
“Besides Vanessa, I don’t have another person to talk to regularly who knows what I’m going through or is sober,” Nielson said. “It can kind of get lonely after you cut off every friend you had, since they were all part of my addiction.”
One relationship isn’t a lot, but it’s a start, Needles said. She hopes as others learn about medications for opioid use disorder and about efforts to curb overdose deaths in the state, overdose response teams will be able to reach more people.
“Everybody deserves a little bit of grace,” Needles said. “We’re all struggling one way or another.”
