(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Gov. Kevin Stitt and legislative leaders on Wednesday announced an agreement on a $12.6 billion state budget for the upcoming fiscal year that contains a tax cut, increased education spending and money to purchase a prison.
Republican leaders praised the budget deal, with one legislator calling it the smoothest negotiations he’d seen in seven years. 
Democrats, though, expressed doubts that the deal benefits Oklahoma residents. 
The proposed tax cut, which drops the state’s top income bracket to 4.5% from 4.75%, comes after years of calls from Stitt. The Republican had faced roadblocks from lawmakers within his own party, who feared it could harm state coffers in bad revenue years. 
It also reduces the number of tax brackets from six to three.
“It stays in people’s pockets to be able to be spent how they see fit,” Stitt said.
The plan calls for triggers to further reduce the top bracket when revenue hits a certain target. Most Oklahomans fall within the top bracket.
A family of four with an income of $50,000 would save about $137 a year, according to Senate staff.
“That’s going to be very, very significant for a lot of families,” Stitt said.
He said the cut is needed so Oklahoma can be competitive with other states.
The budget agreement keeps most state agency allocations flat. However, it includes a 3.15% increase in public school funding, but a nearly 8.8% decrease in CareerTech funding, according to the Oklahoma State School Boards Association. Public schools will get $3.98 billion, up from $3.86 billion, according to the association.
Some other agencies are slated to receive strategic investments for special projects.
Some $200 million will go to construct a University of Oklahoma pediatric heart hospital, said House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow.
Another $250 million is allocated to the Oklahoma State University College of Veterinary Medicine in an effort to increase the number of animal doctors in the state, Hilbert said.
“It has not been taken care of and it should be an absolute gem for the state of Oklahoma,” Hilbert said.
The state also plans to buy the private prison in Lawton for $312 million. The facility currently houses about 2,300 Oklahoma inmates.   
The budget keeps about $3.5 billion in state savings, Hilbert said.
Senate Appropriations Chairman Chuck Hall, R-Perry, said the budget allocates funding to address deferred maintenance at state facilities.
It also calls for a $26 million supplemental appropriation for the financially troubled Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. 
In addition, it gives the agency some funds to finance the provisions of a settlement agreement that the state entered into after being sued for not providing competency restoration services to inmates awaiting trial, said Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, the House Appropriations and Budget Committee chairman.
On the policy side, Republicans said they agreed to create business courts, which are specialized courts that handle commercial litigation matters. They also said they’ve agreed to reform the state’s workers’ compensation system and lawsuits.
Under the proposed tort reform, lawmakers are expected to propose a cap on damages for pain and suffering, called non-economic damages. A prior cap was deemed unconstitutional.
The bills are being drafted and will run through the legislative process, officials said.
Hilbert said it was the seventh year he has been involved in the budget process.
“I would say it to me it feels like the smoothest year in terms of budget negotiations amongst the three stools of the House and Senate and governor,” Hilbert said.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said her party was left out of the process and has some deep concerns about the budget.
She said the budget has priorities for big business and corporate giveaways, but doesn’t prioritize people and services.
“We don’t believe this budget prioritizes people,” she said.
Lawmakers must pass a budget before 5 p.m. May 30.

Bob Ferguson sign or veto a pile of tax bills and a state budget dependent on them? It’s anyone’s guess.
Lawmakers, lobbyists and business leaders are all watching to see what the governor does. Ferguson, just four months on the job, is aware of the acute interest and seems determined to keep folks in suspense right up until Tuesday. 
That’s the appointed deadline for him to act — or not act — on a new two-year operating budget and the pieces of a $9.4 billion tax package on which it is balanced, as well as a multibillion-dollar transportation revenue bill containing a 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax.
“You’ll hear on Tuesday,” Ferguson said as he walked through a parking lot at Saint Martin’s University in Lacey.  “It’s a work in progress. Each day, we make some decisions and delay others. Some are a little more complicated, so we’ll keep talking.”
Pressed on whether lawmakers should be planning to return in summer to deal with his decisions, Ferguson smiled. “I can’t give anything away. I want to keep people guessing,” he said.

The Standard caught up with the first-term Democrat after he addressed 250 people at the Thurston County Chamber of Commerce’s annual meeting.
Ferguson didn’t provide them any clues either, saying only that he’s busy going through “the many bills that need to be signed or vetoed” and has until Tuesday “to essentially sign the budget or make any vetoes I think are appropriate.”
Ferguson didn’t delve into specific budget decisions except to laud the Legislature for putting his requested $100 million law enforcement hiring grant program in the spending plan. But he did tell the crowd he was surprised it “took so much work” to get it through.
It’s not to the finish line. Those dollars are in House Bill 2015, which he’s yet to sign.
He warned, as he has before, spending cuts are made throughout the budget and some taxes are needed to help overcome a shortfall he pegged at $16 billion over four years.
“There are going to be increased taxes,” he said. “There was no way to cut your way out of a $16 billion shortfall. So there’s going to have to be a balance there.”
With tax hikes on the horizon, he acknowledged, “It is becoming unaffordable for a lot of Washingtonians.”
“Anything that the government does that makes life less affordable is a concern,” he said. “Philosophically speaking, these are your dollars and my job is to spend them as efficiently as possible.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0785-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 20:04:42.767525

Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton participates in an 8th District Republican primary debate at the Grizzly Rose in Denver on June 1, 2024. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Democrats, nonprofit advocates and health providers from across Colorado on Wednesday slammed U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans’ vote in favor of a Republican plan to reduce Medicaid spending by an estimated $625 billion over the next 10 years.
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce advanced the plan — part of a sweeping GOP budget package that envisions trillions of dollars in tax cuts paired with trillions more in cuts to spending programs — after a marathon 26-hour hearing that began Tuesday afternoon in Washington. Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican elected to Congress last year, was one of 30 GOP committee members to vote in favor of the cuts, with all 24 Democrats opposed.
About 1 in 4 of Evans’ constituents in the 8th Congressional District, which includes the northern Denver metro area and parts of Weld County, receive Medicaid benefits. Advocates with Protect Our Care Colorado, a coalition of groups opposed to Medicaid cuts, said that Evans’ yes vote broke a promise he made last month not to “support cuts that harm Colorado providers or patients.”

“The shameful cuts advanced in the Energy and Commerce Committee today … will force Colorado to make impossible choices,” said Kathy White, executive director of the Colorado Fiscal Institute. “These cuts to Medicaid have nothing to do with fiscal responsibility or improving efficiency. They take critical healthcare away from people, plain and simple, to finance tax cuts for the rich.”
U.S. House panel passes GOP plan that cuts Medicaid by $625B, adds work requirement

Colorado lawmakers adjourned their 2025 legislative session last week, but have openly discussed the likelihood that they will have to return for a special session later this year to manage the impact of up to $1 billion in federal cuts to the state-administered Medicaid program.
House Republicans’ plan, part of a so-called budget reconciliation bill, includes new work requirements for Medicaid enrollees, a suspension of Biden-era rules aimed at streamlining enrollment and renewal, reductions to federal matching and cost-sharing rates, and more. An analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, shared with States Newsroom by Republican staff on the Energy and Commerce Committee, estimates that the Medicaid changes would add up to $625 billion in cuts over the next decade.
At nearly 10% of projected spending over that period, it would be the largest cut in the program’s 50-year history. About 10.3 million people would lose access to Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with 7.6 million people becoming uninsured during the 10-year budget window, according to the CBO analysis, which has yet to be released publicly.
In a written statement, Evans dismissed concerns about the cuts as “fear mongering for political purposes,” and said the GOP reconciliation bill will preserve Medicaid “for the people who need it most.”
“This bill follows through on our promises to cut waste, fraud and abuse while simultaneously protecting coverage for Colorado’s most vulnerable populations,” he said.

‘Monstrosity of a bill’
Evans didn’t speak at any point during the Energy and Commerce Committee’s lengthy hearing on the bill, which dragged on as Democrats introduced a series of unsuccessful amendments and procedural motions. He skipped at least one vote, on an amendment brought by Democrats to repeal a provision in the bill prohibiting Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal funds, even to cover the costs of cancer screenings, birth control and other non-abortion-related services.
As the clock neared 1 a.m. in Washington, Democrats moved for a recess until the morning, but Republicans defeated the motion on a party-line vote.










House Republicans are so focused on appeasing Trump and giving tax cuts to billionaires that they are gutting essential health care programs and providers.


– U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette


Denver U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, the No. 2 Democrat on the committee, said in a statement on Wednesday’s vote that Republicans had plowed ahead with the hearing “to hide what they are doing from the American people.”
“House Republicans are so focused on appeasing Trump and giving tax cuts to billionaires that they are gutting essential health care programs and providers,” DeGette said. “I called out their cuts throughout the markup, and I am going to continue to fight to protect Medicaid and access to health care as Republicans try to jam this monstrosity of a bill through Congress.”
Democrats say a nationwide Medicaid work requirement, coupled with new mandates for eligibility verification and other obstacles to enrollment enacted by the bill, are extraneous hurdles that will deny care to millions of eligible Americans. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid recipients are already employed, and nearly all the rest are caregivers, students and people with disabilities, according to the nonprofit KFF. Studies have found that state-level Medicaid work requirements, like one enacted in Arkansas, result in substantial losses of coverage and higher administrative costs, but no change in the rate of employment.
In addition to the projected rise in the number of uninsured Americans from Medicaid cuts, Democrats pointed to a CBO analysis showing that an additional 5 million people will lose coverage if Republicans, as expected, decline to extend insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act before they expire this year, bringing the total number losing insurance to 13.7 million.
U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who visited Evans’ district in March to denounce the GOP’s Medicaid cuts, took time during the hearing on Tuesday to warn that Platte Valley Medical Center in Brighton was among the health providers that would be at risk of closure under the GOP plan. And she rejected claims by Evans and other Republicans that the cuts would target benefits for immigrants in the country unlawfully or otherwise fall into the categories of “waste, fraud and abuse.”
“The math is not adding up,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Their claim, which I dispute — but if you believe them, their claim is that 1 million undocumented people are on Medicaid. So why are they trying to cut 13.7 million Americans off their health care?”
“Who do you believe?” asked Ocasio-Cortez. “The people who are trying to cut this — not, by the way, to cut from ‘undeserving people’ to give to ‘deserving people’ — but they are cutting these Medicaid dollars to pay for tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires.”

(Photo courtesy of Boeing)A $96 billion deal with Qatar Airways will give Boeing its largest order ever for South Carolina-made planes, the White House announced Wednesday.
The order of up to 210 jumbo jets is part of $244 billion worth of economic deals between the U.S. and Qatar agreed to while President Donald Trump is visiting the country, according to a White House fact sheet.
The Boeing agreement is for 130 of the 787 Dreamliners made in Charleston County, South Carolina and 30 of the 777 planes built in Washington state, with an option for an additional 50 planes of some combination of the two, according to a Boeing news release.
The order breaks three records for Boeing, the company said: It is the largest ever for its “widebody jets,” generally meaning jets with two aisles that can carry lots of passengers on long flights. It is the largest for the 787 Dreamliners made in North Charleston. And it is Qatar Airways’ largest-ever order.
“A major victory for Boeing, North Charleston, and all of South Carolina,” Gov. Henry McMaster wrote on X. “Thank you to President Trump for making this investment possible and for continuing to put American manufacturing first.”
Boeing employs about 8,200 people in South Carolina, most of them in Charleston County.
“We are deeply honored that Qatar Airways has placed this record-breaking order with Boeing, one that solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center,” Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in the company’s release.
The purchase will make Qatar Airways the largest operator of 787 Dreamliners in the Middle East.
The airline already operates more than 150 Boeing airplanes, including 777 and 787 passenger jets and 777 Freighters, according to Boeing.
Since 2014, Qatar Airways has ordered 94 777X planes and 30 Dreamliners, according to data from Boeing.
The aircraft will be powered by American-made engines from GE Aerospace.
Producing and delivering the planes will support 154,000 domestic jobs annually and more than a million positions over the course of production, according to the White House.
The company’s CEO, Kelley Ortberg, joined Trump and other officials in Doha, the capital of Qatar, for the announcement.
“The landmark deals celebrated today will drive innovation and prosperity for generations, bolster American manufacturing and technological leadership, and put America on the path to a new Golden Age,” the White House said.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham emphasized that this was Boeing’s largest ever widebody and 787 order, dubbing the deal a “game changer” for the company and South Carolina.
“Qatar Airways’ purchase will ensure the Charleston plant has work for many years to come and it is a validation of the work product coming from the Charleston Boeing facility,” Graham said in a statement. “The Boeing workforce in South Carolina has a lot to be proud of – they consistently work hard and provide great airplanes.”
The first of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners built in South Carolina rolled off the North Charleston assembly line in April 2012, about 2 ½ years after the company chose the site, lured by hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of incentives approved by state lawmakers and county officials.
In exchange, the company promised in fall 2009 to invest at least $750 million and create more than 3,800 full-time jobs.
Boeing has expanded its South Carolina operations multiple times since. In 2013, the Legislature provided $120 million more in incentives after the company pledged to invest an additional $1 billion and add 2,000 jobs.
In December, Boeing pledged to invest another $1 billion and add 500 new jobs over five years.

That action was immediately followed by another use of the rule, this time to get a bill passed repealing the paid sick leave law that was also approved by voters.
The use of the rule — a procedural maneuver known as “calling the previous question,” or PQ — requires a signed motion from 10 members and forces an immediate vote on the bill under debate.
Sen. Adam Schnelting, a Republican from St. Charles, made the motion for a PQ on the abortion amendment shortly after 5 p.m. By 5:30 p.m., that bill, which must be approved by voters on a statewide ballot, had passed.
The sick leave repeal followed, and by 6 p.m. both bills were finished.
In the hour leading up to the vote, Democrats warned that Republicans were destroying months of good will and could expect no more cooperation this year and well into the future.
“Nothing will happen, nothing,” said Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck. “The banner year that everybody had in this place? That is over with.”
Wednesday’s use of the previous question rule is the first time since 2020 when it was invoked and the first time since 2017 when it was used during a regular session. Used regularly in the Missouri House, it is used rarely in the Senate because the chamber has a tradition of unlimited debate and negotiations over difficult issues.
“What we’re doing today is a failure of the Senate,” said state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Democrat from Columbia. “And when there’s a failure in the Senate, there needs to be a response, and that response can’t last forever, but that response has to happen, and it has to be painful, and has to make us all understand that when the Senate doesn’t function as a body, we all lose.”
Just as Republicans were moving to put an abortion ban on the ballot, protests erupted in the Senate gallery, with abortion-rights activists shouting down lawmakers. The gallery was briefly cleared, including the press, and the Senate continued with its work until it adjourned for the year a few hours later.
State Sen. Nick Schroer, a Defiance Republican, said using the PQ is always a last resort. But it was his understanding that “goal posts were being moved” in negotiations by Democrats. 
“I don’t know what transpired, but I do know that we hit a log jam,” he said, leaving the PQ as the only way forward to pass the sick leave repeal and abortion ban. 
 Abortion ban

 Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck speaks about negotiations on a bill that seeks to establish a constitutional amendment to ban abortion (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The proposed ban seeks to repeal the constitutional right to an abortion but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation. 
Missourians could see the question on the November 2026 ballot, or as soon as this year if the governor chose to call a special election on the issue. 
The proposed ban, if approved by a simple majority of voters, would reinstate several targeted regulations on abortion providers, or TRAP laws, that were recently struck down as unconstitutional by a Missouri judge. 
It would also ban gender transition surgeries and prescribing medications for gender transition, including puberty blockers, for children younger than 18.
The amendment also includes a severability clause. This could allow the rape and incest exceptions in the amendment to be challenged in federal court as being discriminatory and in violation of the 14th Amendment. 
If approved, the amendment would also require any legal challenges to the state law around reproductive health care be heard in Cole County. The Missouri Attorney General’s Office was recently unsuccessful in convincing the courts to move an ongoing legal battle between the state and Planned Parenthood from Jackson County to Cole County.
The language that could appear on each ballot does not mention the amendment would ban abortions, a detail that’s been highly-criticized by Democrats as deceiving. 
Democrats have also accused Republicans of including the ban on gender-affirming care for minors, which is already illegal in Missouri, as a form of “ballot candy” — a ruse aimed at tricking voters to support a measure they might otherwise vote against.  
Schroer said removal of the transgender health care provisions was a deal breaker for conservative senators. 
“We talked to a lot of our members,” he said, “and they said that issue needs to be included.” 
Amendment 3 narrowly passed in November following a multi-million dollar campaign by abortion-rights advocates. A day later, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state, challenging several of Missouri’s laws focused on abortion facilities and providers.
An amendment to alter the language so it directly states that it is repealing Amendment 3 was defeated just before the motion to cut off debate.
While many sitting Republicans have previously opposed abortion exceptions outside of those to save the mother’s life, many said the November election showed Missourians’ desire for a less stringent law.
Missourians overwhelmingly support abortion exceptions for survivors, an August 2022 SLU/YouGov poll found. The polling was done several weeks after Missouri became the first state to enact a full abortion ban following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
Since Amendment 3 took effect, surgical abortions are being performed but medication abortions have not.
Three of the state’s several Planned Parenthood clinics have restarted surgical abortions for those up to 12 weeks gestation at clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis. 
The clinics were authorized to begin the procedure again for the first time in nearly three years after a judge struck down many of the state’s abortion regulations, citing them as discriminatory.
Medication abortion — the most common means of ending a pregnancy — remains inaccessible in Missouri after the state health department rejected complication plans submitted by the clinics outlining continued care for patients in the case they had any adverse effects from the medication. 
 Sick leave law

  State Sen. Tracy McCreery, D-Olivette, prepares for Senate Republicans to force a vote on a constitutional amendment to ban abortion (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
If the bill is signed by the governor, the paid-sick leave benefits approved by voters that went into effect on May 1 will be stripped away on Aug. 28. 
The bill also removes the requirement that the minimum wage be indexed to inflation, which has been in place since 2007
The paid sick leave and minimum wage provisions passed with 58% of the vote in November as Proposition A, garnering support from unions, workers’ advocacy groups, social justice and civil rights groups, as well as over 500 business owners. 
“Workers are earning paid sick leave right now,” said state Sen. Patty Lewis, a Democrat from Kansas City, “and then it’s going to get taken away and they’re going to be fired up about it.”
GOP critics have portrayed paid sick leave as a “job killer” that would hurt small businesses. The bill was sponsored by state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a Republican from Jefferson City, and Republican state Rep. Sherri Gallick of Belton. 
Senate Democrats have been in negotiations with Republicans over the last month to modify the bill, in what they’ve said is an effort to maintain the will of the voters in expanding paid sick leave rather than gut it entirely, as well as make it easier for businesses to comply.
State Sen. Tracy McCreery, an Olivette Democrat, said senators have “worked tirelessly to figure out some kind of compromise.” 
The Democrats spent two nights blocking a vote on the paid sick leave repeal earlier in the session.
Under Proposition A, employers with business receipts greater than $500,000 a year must provide at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours.
The measure made sick leave guaranteed for 728,000 workers who lacked it statewide, or over 1 in 3 Missouri workers, according to an analysis from the progressive nonprofit the Missouri Budget Project. 
Richard Von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs with Justice, the organization that helped lead the campaign for Proposition A, said it’s a slap in the face to voters that will create “disgruntled employees” and cause “chaos” for businesses.
“Proposition A was passed so overwhelmingly, with so much support from Republican voters, it seemed that it would be so controversial in the legislature that Republican politicians would be more hesitant than they apparently are,” he said, “to overturn the will of their own voters, and cause them economic pain.”
The message lawmakers are sending is: “They don’t believe that you deserve economic security,” he added. 
It could also cause backlash for the lawmakers from districts who supported the measure, he said. 
“We’re going to make sure that workers don’t experience this as something that just happens to us without understanding these are decisions made by people, and workers have the ability to hold people accountable for those decisions,” he said.
Von Glahn said it’s not the end of the fight for paid sick leave, and advocates will consider putting it on the ballot again as a constitutional amendment, a move that would make it much harder for lawmakers to repeal. 
“I’m confident,” he said, “this is a policy that Missourians want and we’re going to continue to fight for that through every means necessary.” 
 Republican fractures 

 Sen. Mike Cierpiot, R-Lee’s Summit, speaks on the Senate floor on Feb. 10, 2021 (screenshot courtesy of Senate Communications).
The debate Wednesday afternoon began about 12:30 p.m. and Democrats held the floor for much of the time. But near the start of the debate, state Sen. Mike Cierpiot, a Lee’s Summit Republican, aired his grievances with the leadership of Missouri Right to LIfe.
Cierpiot accused the organization, one of the most visible anti-abortion groups in the state, of focusing more on enforcing purity of thought and maintaining its influence within the GOP than writing laws acceptable to most Missourians.
Amendment 3 reinstated abortion rights lost in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. If Missouri Right to Life’s leaders had not demanded a ban with no exceptions for rape or incest, he said, Amendment 3 might have been defeated.
“Their leadership, Ms. (Susan) Klein, and Mr. (Dave) Plemmons and Mr. (Steve) Rupp have been much more interested in causing Republican brush fires over issues with much smaller or no impact on the huge effort for life,” Cierpiot said. 
The problems with Missouri Right to Life was evident in the 2024 elections when it made single-candidate endorsements, freezing out candidates who had been ardent anti-abortion legislators. The organization endorsed then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft in the Republican primary for governor, then refused to endorse Republican nominee Mike Kehoe for the general election.
Other Republicans who won without the endorsement of Missouri Right to Life joined in the criticism. State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, said the law triggered by the 2022 abortion decision was negotiated in spite of Missouri Right to Life, not with its help.
“I don’t know that I really care, frankly, that they didn’t endorse me,” Coleman said. “What I do care about is that they didn’t endorse Gov.

Free.,"Noem, Democrats tangle over protest at New Jersey immigrant detention center",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/noem-democrats-tangle-over-protest-new-jersey-immigrant-detention-center,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Wednesday harshly criticized three Democrats who were accosted by federal immigration officials while protesting the opening of an immigrant detention center in New Jersey.Democrats at the hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee in turn said Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials physically assaulted the lawmakers.Noem, who was appearing to discuss President Donald Trump's fiscal year 2026 budget for the agency, said the Democrats who went to Delaney Hall to oversee the conditions were not conducting proper oversight.Members of Congress are allowed to conduct oversight visits at any DHS facility that detains immigrants, without prior notice, under provisions in an appropriations law.“I believe that it was breaking into a federal facility and assaulting law enforcement officers,” Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, said.Newark incidentLast Friday, the three New Jersey Democratic members – Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez — were in Newark protesting the reopening of an immigrant detention center.The mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, was arrested. It was a stark escalation of Democratic lawmakers’ opposition to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.After the incident, Menendez detailed how ICE agents “pushed, physically assaulted two female members of Congress.” Several Republicans on the panel that oversees Homeland Security, including Chair Mark Green of Tennessee, said there should be consequences for the Democrats, such as criminal charges.Green accused one of three Democrats of assaulting a law enforcement officer.“This behavior demands a swift and firm response, and I assure you, action will be taken,” Green said.Arizona GOP Rep. Eli Crane suggested there be criminal charges lodged against the Democratic members and Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee suggested to Noem that she “look into actions (to) be taken if a member assaulted” law enforcement.The top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, slammed Noem for the incident.“Instead of following the law, masked ICE personnel stopped and assaulted the members,” he said. “Then, to make matters worse, instead of launching an investigation into the incident, your department lied to the press about the situation and threatened to arrest members of Congress for doing their job.”One of the Democrats who was at the detention center protest, McIver, sits on the committee, but she did not speak to Noem about the incident.“This is not about me,” McIver said, and instead pressed Noem about international students who had their visas revoked.Focus on Abrego GarciaDemocrats criticized Noem and the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement that has led to swift deportations and concerns about a lack of due process.They especially focused on Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador.Rhode Island Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner called Noem’s leadership of DHS “sloppy,” and said it has led to immigrants and even U.S. citizen children being wrongly deported.“Instead of enforcing the laws, you have repeatedly broken them,” Magaziner said. “You need to change course immediately before more innocent people are hurt on your watch.”California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell asked Noem if Abrego Garcia was given proper due process.Swalwell said he was defending due process and held up a poster that showed Trump holding a picture of Abrego Garcia’s hand that digitally added “MS-13” tattoos to his knuckles.He asked her several times if the photo was doctored. Noem did not answer the question but said she was unaware of the image.Instead she said that even if Abrego Garcia were returned to the United States, he would be immediately deported. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia but he remains in El Salvador.Crane asked Noem if she supported suspending habeas corpus, something that top Trump officials such as Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller have floated.Habeas corpus allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained to petition for their release in court, and it’s used to challenge immigration detention. It’s currently the only avenue that Venezuelans subject to the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 have to challenge their deportation under the wartime law.“That's not in my purview to weigh in on,” Noem said. “This is the president's prerogative to pursue, and he has not indicated to me that he will or will not be taking that action.”The U.S. Constitution allows for habeas corpus to be suspended “in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”Crane argued that unauthorized immigration counted as an “invasion,” and therefore could be used to suspend habeas corpus.Habeas corpus has been suspended four times in U.S. history, during the Civil War; in almost a dozen South Carolina counties that were overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during reconstruction; in a 1905 insurrection in U.S. territories in the Philippines; and after the Pearl Harbor bombing in Hawaii.FEMA dismantlingThompson grilled Noem about the president’s comments wanting to dismantle FEMA.Noem said that she is supportive of Trump’s policy.“The president has been clear that he wants to empower states to give them the opportunity to build out their response,” she said.She said that while the federal government will be there for support, that local and state governments “know what they need.”Thompson asked Noem if she had a plan for the federal government responding to natural disasters.Noem said while there is nothing in writing, “the White House is coming forward with a plan…that will be making recommendations.”GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez of Florida, said that while he supports efforts to “reform FEMA,” he stressed to Noem that “we can’t leave those who can’t fend for themselves.”",,,,2025-05-14 20:04:42.767525

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Frontline workers at Butler Hospital unable to reach a new contract with hospital management will walk off the job starting at 6 a.m. Thursday, despite a push by state lawmakers to coax both sides back to the negotiating table.
A May 8 letter to Butler Hospital President & COO Mary Marran signed by 44 legislators calls on the management of Rhode Island’s only private, nonprofit psychiatric hospital to negotiate a new contract with SEIU 1199NE workers, whose last labor contracts expired on March 31. 
SEIU 1199NE represents nearly 800 professional and clerical staff, registered nurses, mental health workers, and housekeeping and dietary staff at the hospital on Blackstone Boulevard in Providence. The workers are demanding higher wages, pension program access for future employees and greater attention to workplace safety. The union announced April 25 that its members had voted to authorize a strike.
“None of us want to strike,” Ashley Ouellette, an R.N. float nurse who has worked at the 168-bed hospital owned by Care New England since 2016, said in a phone interview. She is a member of the union’s executive board and bargaining committee. 
“Nobody cares about these patients more than we do,” Ouellette said. “As scary as it may be, we’re going to do whatever we have to protect the work that is done here.”
Butler Hospital frontline caregivers working without contract want more safety precautions

A message from Marran to the Butler community posted Wednesday on the butlerinfoforyou.org website indicated a strike appeared imminent.
“Please know we have worked hard to try to reach a satisfactory agreement with the union, but so far have been unsuccessful in these efforts,” Marran wrote. 
“No doubt the days ahead will challenge us all. I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt care and concern for each and every one of you. Whether you will be participating in the picketing or remaining on duty to help care for our patients, you are the staff that make this organization a leader in behavioral healthcare and your dedication and hard work are deeply valued and appreciated.”
A post on X by the city of Providence warned that traffic may be significant Thursday morning on Blackstone Boulevard, especially on the north side where Butler’s entrance is.
The 22 state senators and 22 state reps who wrote the letter to Marran expressed concern that the pending strike “would impact patient care, overwhelm our emergency rooms, and place additional strain on state resources.” Butler serves some of the most vulnerable individuals in the state, with nearly 70% of patients relying on Medicaid or Medicare.
The legislators’ letter claimed the majority of Butler workers earn under $20 an hour, with some as low as $15.30. Marran disputed those figures in an email to Rhode Island Current clarifying key facts about the hospital’s best, last and final proposal to the union on May 7.
“Only 20% of Butler’s union employees currently make under $20 per hour, not the overwhelming majority,” Marran said. “Under our latest proposal, that number would drop significantly within weeks of ratification, and by the end of the contract, 99% of our current union workforce would be above $20 per hour. We also offered substantial raises, preserved the pension for all current employees, guaranteed lower health plan contributions, and committed to partnering with the existing Health and Safety Committee on further improving staff safety.”
Marran said she wanted the community to be aware that Butler will remain open and continue to provide care for patients. “We are committed to reaching a meaningful agreement with the union and continuing to provide safe, compassionate, and uninterrupted care to the community we proudly serve,” she said.
The cost of bringing in replacement workers will leave Butler with fewer resources in future proposals to the union, Marran said, She did not confirm how much the hospital will have to spend to cover the striking workers.
SEIU 1199NE Executive Vice President Jesse Martin claimed the hospital planned ahead to bring in temporary labor at a cost of $1.8 million.
The union said Wednesday there were 116 open positions at Butler. 
“We have lost some really, really incredible staff to go work at other hospitals in the state or even out of state because of the wages here,”  Ouellette said.
Staff shortages have impacted staff training and onboarding, which union members say contributes to diminished workplace safety.
SEIU 1199NE says patient assaults on staff increased 41% between 2022 to 2024 while 95% of Butler caregivers say Care New England was not doing enough to keep them safe at work.
Ouellette said a friend and fellow nurse at the hospital is out of work with whiplash after being punched in the face by a patient a few days ago.
“We can’t have new staff training new staff. That happens here and it’s terrifying,” Ouellette said. “I’ve seen it happen multiple times and I know my coworkers have seen it happen multiple times. Like there’s absolutely no reason that a person who’s been here for a couple of months should be training. They’re still learning.”

(FWP photo)When Tom Millett, a Republican state lawmaker from Marion, was working at a nuclear powerplant on Lake Michigan nearly 30 years ago, he routinely found himself face to face with zebra mussels. 
The small freshwater mollusks are not native to North America, but were introduced into many waterways east of the Mississippi River in the 1980s, including the Great Lakes and have spread prolifically, earning a moniker as one of the most dangerous invasive species on the continent. 
For Millett, zebra mussels would routinely coat parts of the power plant that connected to the freshwater lake.
“We had to go in there and we had to actually physically remove the zebra mussels all the time,” Millett said. “And I can just tell you stories about zebra mussels, that we would take them out in big, huge dumpsters. By the dumpster load. That’s how prolific these things are.”
In an 2024 environmental review for the Palisades Nuclear Plant on Lake Michigan, it was reported that zebra mussels still coated parts of the intake system, an inch-and-a-half thick. 
To prevent a similar problematic infestation of Montana waterways, Millett carried House Bill 242 during the 2025 Legislative session, increasing the fines for anyone who knowingly or negligently introduces any aquatic invasive species into Montana or fails to stop at a watercraft check station.
Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the bill on May 5.

Aquatic invasive species include plants, animals and pathogens that are not native to the state, and can harm the ecosystem and economy. 
Mussels are one of the common poster species for AIS prevention. 
Montana doesn’t yet have a major problem with Zebra mussels, or the similarly invasive quagga mussel, but neighboring states do, and there have been several suspicious detections of mussels and their larvae in Montana waterways, including Canyon Ferry Reservoir and the Missouri River. 
Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks runs a program to counteract aquatic invasive species, which includes a public information campaign and numerous AIS check stations that all boaters in Montana, including non-motorized ones such as canoes and stand-up paddleboards, are required to stop at for inspection. 
Out-of-state boaters must also obtain an inspection before launching on Montana waters. 
In 2024, FWP officials reported intercepting more than 47 mussel-fouled boats, and 800 transporting aquatic weeds. 
According to the state’s AIS inspection dashboard, FWP reports that watercraft check stations have already intercepted 10 mussel-fouled boats in 2025. 
The new law essentially doubles the fine for a first negligent offense as well as subsequent offenses for introducing AIS or failing to stop at an inspection station— from $500 to $700 for a first offense and from $750 to $1400 for subsequent offenses. 
In addition, knowingly attempting to introduce an invasive species to Montana, a felony, now has a fine of as much as $25,000. 
“Is that tough? It’s absolutely tough, because we can’t risk having AIS being introduced into Montana to hurt our fishing industry, our tourism industry, our hydro facilities, our water treatment plants or any of our industries that employ thousands of Montanans,” Millett said during a hearing on his bill in February. “We need to send a message to everyone who wants to come to Montana that we are serious about keeping our waters clean now and for future generations.”
Millett’s bill was supported during legislative hearings by researchers with the Flathead Lake Biological Station, the Montana Association of Conservation Districts, Montana Audubon, The Fishing Outfitters Association of Montana, Trout Unlimited, and the Little Bitterroot Lake Association. 

The threat of AIS, specifically zebra and quagga mussels, comes with a drastic price tag. 
A 2019 study published by the University of Montana’s Flathead Lake Biological Station estimated that if mussels colonized all of Montana’s water bodies, it could cost the state between $384.5 million to $731.4 million in mitigation costs, lost revenue and property value losses.

Prevention efforts, by comparison, are cheap. 
Montana spent more than $3.6 million running its inspection and decontamination stations in 2018, and operates a grant program that disseminates more than a half million dollars for invasive species-related prevention. 
In 2024, the Fish, Wildlife and Parks and partners conducted more than 130,000 watercraft inspections across the state, resulting in 47 citations and 91 written warnings. 
Under the law signed last week, the increased fines leveraged against violators would be funneled into the state’s general fund. 
FWP officials remind all Montanans that boaters and anglers must remember to clean, drain and dry their watercraft before leaving a water access site and are required to stop at all open watercraft inspection stations. 
Nonresidents and residents returning home must have their watercraft inspected before launching in Montana. Watercraft must also be drained of all water before transporting.

When Karina Lariz was released from a California prison in September 2021, she had only the clothes she was arrested in — stretched out and weathered by time. She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.

With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.










If I didn't have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did.


– Karina Lariz, cash assistance recipient


The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.

According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.

Legislation and pilot programs

A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.

This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.

Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.

Potential savings

In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.

Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

(Courtesy photo)When Marissa Munoz took her oldest child to an urgent care clinic in Albuquerque 16 years ago, she didn’t know what Medicaid was until the staff explained to her how it could cover his treatment, and how to apply.
Now, with congressional Republicans threatening to gut Medicaid, she can’t imagine life without it.
Munoz lives in the South Valley, just outside Albuquerque. Originally from Juarez, Mexico, she came to the United States 23 years ago. Her three other children are still minors and also enrolled in Medicaid.
On Sunday, House Republicans released a plan that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would cut $715 billion to Medicaid funding, which could translate to more than $1.1 billion in cuts here in New Mexico, according to budget experts. On Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. House of Representatives panel in charge of overhauling Medicaid voted to move the proposal, which also adds work requirements for eligibility, forward.
Munoz told Source NM in an interview lawmakers in Congress should be aware of how the communities they represent benefit from Medicaid coverage, specifically for mental health treatment.
“If they’re going to cut those benefits, then that problem is going to get worse,” she said.
Munoz said her 13-year-old son has autism, thyroid issues and developmental delays. Every three months since he was a baby, medical staff have tested his blood and scanned his body with an MRI machine. Medicaid has covered the cost of those visits, and allowed her to seek second opinions when needed, she said.
Other students bullied Munoz’s son for being disabled, which led him to try to take his own life on two separate occasions. “He’s been going through a lot,” she said.
Munoz’s son now needs a weekly visit with a counselor at his school, which is also covered by Medicaid. The counselor helps him process his emotions, she said.
“Without Medicaid all these years, I don’t know how I would have done all this,” Munoz said. “I wouldn’t have been able to afford all of the treatment and care for him, let alone his medication.”
In interviews with Source NM, health care advocates in New Mexico said the proposed cuts would hurt not only patients but also rural hospitals, which heavily rely on Medicaid to pay for their operations.
New Mexico Voices for Children health policy analyst Monica Otero  told Source NM that Medicaid covers about 61% of New Mexican children, and 55% of births.
“Consistent health coverage really plays a role in reducing birth complications and health outcomes for birthing parents and children,” said Otero, who is pregnant herself and learning the importance of prenatal and perinatal care.
Arika Sanchez, health care director at the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, said if New Mexico experiences these cuts, they would impact children, people with disabilities, elders, veterans, people working low-wage jobs that don’t provide health insurance, people in nursing homes and caregivers.
“Cutting Medicaid and putting on these work requirements just to increase barriers for people who get their health insurance through Medicaid, all of this is just an excuse to fund tax breaks for really wealthy people and corporations,” Sanchez said. “It really prioritizes profit over the care of our communities.”
Two months ago, Munoz said she and her family also enrolled in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), because she divorced her husband and she needed to make ends meet.
On Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, the U.S. House Agriculture Committee held a markup on the Republican tax bill, which would cut $290 billion in SNAP benefits. SNAP provides Munoz’s family with $356 per month in food assistance, which she said covers a lot but not all of their food expenses.
“As a single mom, it’s hard to provide good food for the kids,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For the past four years, Munoz has worked part-time as a parental advisor for the nonprofit Partnership for Community Action, where she helps parents learn how to care for children aged zero to 5 years old, advocate for themselves, receive public benefits and get connected to different organizations around Albuquerque.
Munoz said her experience caring for her 13-year-old son has taught her about how Medicaid works, and better equipped her to help address the needs of parents facing similar situations with their own disabled children.
“It’s hard for parents to tell their kids, ‘I’m sorry, we don’t have a meal today,’” Munoz said.
If lawmakers also cut funding for SNAP, then that will only make it harder for families to succeed by taking the time to interview for jobs, she said.
Sanchez said when the government takes health care away from families, people put off going to the doctor, don’t receive preventive care and wait to receive care until they can’t put it off any longer, often leading to emergency room visits that are more expensive for them, the hospitals and the state.
“These cuts will not only impact families and patients but also providers, hospitals and our overall health care system,” she said.
Munoz asked lawmakers to consider what they would do if they got into an accident, or needed to see a doctor, and did not have certainty that the care would be paid for.
“I want the people in charge to think more about our community, because not everyone has the opportunity to have a good job,” she said. “Parents are going through a lot, and having these benefits is meaningful for them.”

“My concern is that the state of New Mexico and our citizens will not have an independent review of the impacts the labs are having,” New Mexico Environment Department Resource Protection Division Director Rick Shean told Source NM. “Without this funding, going forward we’re not going to be able to sample and monitor the environment for ourselves in order to ensure that the data that they’re collecting is true.”
NMED has operated water, air and environmental monitoring projects at LANL and Sandia since 1990, and later included the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad.
“We’re verifying they’re not impacting the environment and public health around their facilities,” Shean said. The bureau does not regulate the sites but does release data to the public on its findings.
The work is funded by a U.S. Department of Energy grant, which was developed as part of an agreement between the state and federal government.
Previously, one office in the Department of Energy paid for the grant funding the oversight bureau at NMED. In recent reshuffling at the federal level, the National Nuclear Security Administration was assigned to foot part of the bill. Currently, NMED’s Department of Energy Oversight Bureau has 16 employees and a budget of $4.3 million. The NNSA has failed to pay its share for the past three years, Shean said. For this year, that amounts to a $750,000 gap, approximately 17% of the budget for the state oversight program.
Without the funding, NMED would have to stop the current monitoring work at the national laboratories on May 30, Shean said. WIPP monitoring would still continue.
Compounding the missing funding, Shean says new federal projects are putting more strain on existing employees. For instance, Shean noted LANL’s new plan to start venting pent up barrels of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, possibly in June, which would increase the monitoring workload for the oversight bureau.
Shean said he received assurances on May 9 after a meeting with NNSA officials, that federal funds would be available by May 16.
In an emailed statement, the NNSA said it issued a partial payment to NMED, but did not disclose the amount.
“NNSA will continue to incrementally fund its portion of the funds for the remainder of FY 2025,” the statement said. The statement concluded by saying the agency would pay NMED by the close of the fiscal year. It’s unclear if that indicates the federal fiscal year (in September) or New Mexico’s fiscal year, which ends in June.
NMED spokesperson Drew Goretzka confirmed to Source NM that NNSA sent a partial payment to the agency but said the NNSA statement to Source does not reflect previous commitments the federal government made. Source has a pending request for more specifics on the amount of the payment that was made.
“That timeline does not line up with what they presented to us in meetings in which they are going to deliver the funds by this Friday, May 16,” Goretzka said in a phone call. “We’re still under the impression they’ll deliver the funds by then.”

,California,2025-05-14 22:36:31+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom moves to close another state prison. That makes 5 since he took office,Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/05/prison-closure-state-budget/,California’s falling incarcerated population has allowed Gov. Gavin Newsom to close four state prisons. Now he’s calling for a fifth.,"In summary
California’s falling incarcerated population has allowed Gov. Gavin Newsom to close four state prisons. Now he’s calling for a fifth.


Gov. Gavin Newsom today called for the closure of another prison in his new budget proposal, which would be the fifth facility closed under his watch, though he didn’t specify which institution now has a target on its back. 
The closure, which Newsom proposed take place by October 2026, would happen despite the implementation of Proposition 36, a new California law that is predicted to briefly increase the number of people in the prison system. 
“While Proposition 36 is expected to increase (the prison) population, the population should continue its downward trend over the long-term,” Newsom said in the proposal. 
Newsom’s proposed budget pledges that a  prison closure would save about $150 million annually. He called for the shutdown as part of his plan to close a $12 billion deficit.
The Legislative Analyst’s Office has calculated that California’s prison population — which, despite Prop 36’s additional inmates, is still estimated to start dropping again in 2027 — could allow Newsom to close as many as five more prisons, saving $1 billion a year. 
Instead, in last year’s budget cycle and in the new budget proposal, Newsom has taken a more cautious approach to trimming prison beds. Last year, he proposed closing 46 housing blocks inside 13 state prisons but declined to call for a total prison closure. 
Advocates for prison closures welcomed Newsom’s announcement. 
“I am relieved that Gov. Newsom has taken a step in the right direction by announcing an additional prison will close in 2026,” said Amber-Rose Howard, executive director of Californians United for a Responsible Budget, a coalition that advocates for reduced incarceration. “In the midst of an extremely difficult political moment, where Californians are suffering budget cuts to life-affirming programs, prison closures are a smart solution to offset some of those cuts.”
At the inmate population’s peak in 2006, California locked up 165,000 people in state prisons. Today, after a decade of sentencing changes, federal court intervention and a surge of releases tied to COVID-19, California’s prisons house about 91,000 people. 
The Newsom administration expects to spend about $13.6 billion on the prison system next year. 
Newsom has already moved to close four prisons over the course of his administration. He projects that those shutdowns will save the state $3.4 billion by 2027.
So far, Newsom closed the Deuel Vocational Institution in Tracy in 2021 and the California Correctional Center in Susanville in 2023. He ended a lease with a privately run prison called the California City Correctional Facility, and the corrections department removed the last prisoners from the Chuckwalla Valley State Prison near the Arizona border in October.
Some of those communities fought back, notably in Blythe, where the city hired a PR firm and attempted to lobby for the Chuckwalla facility’s survival. So far, the governor’s office has not shown any signs of reversing course. 
California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesperson Terri Hardy said in a statement that the department will make its facility choice based on its own guidelines. 
Those guidelines, spelled out in the California penal code, dictate that the criteria for closing prisons include the age and condition of the facility, its geographic proximity to other prisons, the economic impact to the local community and the programming available to incarcerated people at the facility.  
The corrections department “is committed to managing its resources efficiently to best serve the people of California,” Hardy said. “The state would support the affected local community and workforce with an economic resiliency plan, and workers would be offered transfers to nearby facilities.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425-California-Correctional-Center-GC-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 19:07:31.013777

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)LOUISVILLE — As Republicans in Washington advanced a proposed Medicaid work requirement Wednesday, two Kentucky advocates speaking in Louisville disagreed on the wisdom of the policy. 
A House committee chaired by U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Bowling Green, approved a plan for trimming  $625 billion in federal Medicaid spending over the next decade that includes new copays and work and reporting requirements. The vote is an early step in moving the changes, part of a massive tax and spending bill, through both chambers of Congress. The federal Medicaid work requirement would not take effect until 2029, under the bill approved by Guthrie’s House Energy and Commerce Committee during a marathon session that lasted 25 hours.

The federal-state Medicaid program pays for almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care.
The Louisville Forum already was planning to host a debate around the question: Will changes to Medicaid  “heal or hurt?” after Medicaid also took center stage in Kentucky’s 2025 legislative session. 
Deborah Yetter, a Kentucky Hall of Fame journalist who writes for the Lantern, moderated the Wednesday panel between Jim Waters, president of the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, and Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health. 
On work requirements 
Waters and Beauregard spent a large chunk of the debate discussing the ins and outs of Medicaid work requirements. 
During the legislative session Kentucky lawmakers added a mandated work requirement for Kentuckians  between the ages of 18 and 60 who don’t have dependents and are both “physically and mentally able to work.” 
Waters said that “there’s going to be some hurt whenever you try to rein in a program that’s really exploded in cost” and said Medicaid “was intended to be for the truly disabled, indigent.”

“It was not meant to be a destination,” he said. “It was meant to help along the way.” 
“Contrary to maybe what some people think, there is not an automated taxpayer machine there in Frankfort,” he said. “I mean, taxpayers are not an endless source of resources, so resources are limited, and they need to be spent in a way that actually helps people.” 
Beauregard said “we don’t need work requirements for Medicaid” and said reporting requirements often lead to administrative hurdles that keep people from being able to prove their employment, such as hard-to-prove seasonal work or literacy issues. 
Beauregard said work requirements are “short sighted” because “it is a prerequisite to work that you are healthy.” 
“While we do spend a decent amount of money on Medicaid, the cost of being uninsured is much greater — and it’s not only greater to the individual, it’s greater to our entire economy and to our health care system,” she said. 
For Waters, Medicaid is “unsustainable” as it is. 
“Don’t we want fewer people on Medicaid? I think that should be the goal,” Waters said. “Fewer people on Medicaid means when people are in the private workforce getting coverage from employers, are independent, are experiencing the dignity of work and effort,” he said. “If everybody, pretty much, is working …. that’s receiving Medicaid benefits now, like I’ve heard, and then it’s a very small percentage that aren’t, what’s the problem with implementing a program that gets the rest of those folks onto an employer’s payroll and off of the taxpayers’ benefit plan.” 
On fraud
Lawmakers have cited fraud prevention as a motivator to more thoroughly oversee and rein in Medicaid. 
Beauregard said “there’s very little fraud for individuals” and that fraud is “mostly in the provider arena, and it’s not widespread.” 
“Individuals aren’t able to take advantage of their Medicaid coverage for nonmedical purposes,” she said. “You can’t take your Medicaid card and use it to purchase groceries or go on a vacation. Very few people are getting a root canal for the fun of it.” 
Waters believes “there’s more fraud that we even know right now” and called on the newly established Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board to “be aggressive in looking at what fraud is happening and the extent of it.” 
“Taxpayers deserve to know what that is, and to have somebody looking at that,” he said.

Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused three New Jersey House Democrats Wednesday of “lawlessness” by appearing at a new migrant jail in Newark on Friday and scuffling with federal agents after the agents arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.
Noem, speaking before the House Committee on Homeland Security, called the Democrats’ actions “beneath this body.” Federal officials have already said they are considering charges for the three, Reps. Rob Menendez, LaMonica McIver and Bonnie Watson Coleman.
“Members of Congress should not break into detention centers or federal facilities,” Noem said Wednesday. “Had these members requested a tour, we certainly would have facilitated the tour.”

Menendez, McIver, and Watson Coleman have been at the center of controversy since Baraka’s arrest at the new migrant jail, Delaney Hall, which Baraka says is operating without required city permits. Videos of the melee that erupted when agents arrested Baraka show McIver pushing past a federal agent, a moment the Department of Homeland Security has highlighted on social media. McIver has alleged that agents assaulted her and Watson Coleman and “roughed up” Menendez.
The three House Democrats say they visited Delaney Hall as part of their oversight duties. They have refuted the claim that they broke into the facility, and they blasted a resolution introduced by Rep. Earl Carter (R-Georgia) that would strip them of their committee assignments. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) said Wednesday that McIver should be expelled from Congress entirely.
“This is just another attempt to distract from the reality of what Republicans are seeking to do: strip healthcare away from 13.7 million Americans and slash programs that strengthen our communities and make them healthier,” they said in a joint statement. “As we all know, Members of Congress have a legal right to conduct oversight at any DHS detention facility without prior notice, and that’s exactly what we were doing last week. This week, we’re back in Washington doing exactly what New Jerseyans sent us here to do: delivering for them.”
Republicans on the House’s homeland security panel echoed Noem’s criticism Wednesday.
“When you punch a law enforcement officer, that’s not the law enforcement officer’s fault. This behavior demands a swift and firm response, and I assure you action will be taken,” said Rep. Mark Green (R-Tennessee), the committee’s chairman.
Much of the hearing Wednesday centered around issues like due process for legal residents facing deportation and border security. But some members defended their fellow Democrats about the Delaney Hall matter.
Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi) said he’s “never seen anything like” the way Congress members were treated Friday, calling it “a sad day.
“Even when the secretary, my Republican colleagues, and I had strong disagreements, we still had productive conversations, and did our duty to keep America safe, but that’s not the case any longer,” he said. “My colleagues across the aisle have sold their souls or at least their spines to Donald Trump. They try to cover the administration’s lies and blame Democrats for doing the job our constituents send us here to do.”
Rep. Nellie Pou (D-09) called it “disturbing and certainly dangerous” that federal officials would publicly threaten to arrest members of Congress.
Baraka is scheduled to appear in federal court Thursday on a trespassing charge. 
The mayor, who is among six vying for the Democratic nomination for governor on June 10, was at Delaney Hall Friday as part of a series of protests outside the facility. On Wednesday, he shared video showing federal agents allowing him inside the gate that separates the jail from the street.
“Nobody was kicking or shoving like the coverage suggests. We were invited in,” he said.
Other videos from Friday show federal agents asking Baraka to leave the property and Baraka walking to the street-side of the gate before agents arrested him.
On Saturday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that Menendez, McIver, and Watson Coleman could be arrested. Noem didn’t comment directly on that Wednesday.
In a press release Wednesday, McLaughlin repeated the claim that the three House Democrats stormed the facility, and said they can’t “break the law in the name of ‘oversight.’”
McIver is a member of the House’s homeland security panel. When Noem appeared before it Wednesday, McIver didn’t respond to Noem’s or Republicans’ criticism of her and her Democratic colleagues, and instead grilled Noem on workplace conditions and collective bargaining rights for Transportation Security Administration agents and the revocation of international students’ visas without due process.
“A lot has been said, and I expect a lot more will be said about the department’s interactions with members of this body when it comes to oversight,” McIver said. “But this is not about me.”

The House Environment Committee is starting to explore how the state could reintroduce an apex predator. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: What would it take to bring cougars back to Vermont?.","A mountain lion. Photo via Adobe StockRight now, the closest answer to the question of “What would catamounts in Vermont look like?” may be an AI-generated image of the large cat in a state forest, or perhaps it’s UVM’s felted Rally Cat mascot cheering from the sidelines of a hockey game.But soon, the House Environment Committee hopes to flesh out that image a little further and launch a feasibility study for what reintroducing cougars to the Green Mountain State would entail. (Had to!)Jed Murdoch, a wildlife biologist at UVM’s Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, joined the committee Wednesday to explain the role of apex predators in an ecosystem and to walk through what would need to happen to reintroduce the animals to Vermont. (BTW, cougar = catamount = panther = mountain lion — and the list goes on. The Puma concolor holds the record for the mammal with the most English names) These big cats have been officially considered extinct in the state since 2018, though the last known cougar in Vermont was killed in 1881. You can see him at the Vermont History Museum.Rep. Amy Sheldon, D-Middlebury, said she’s been interested in exploring cougar reintroduction as part of her broader mission toward a “connected and functioning landscape,” she said in an interview. Though the state’s Fish & Wildlife Department already has a full plate, Sheldon believes facilitating the cascade of ecological processes that can come from the introduction of a keystone species may actually lighten that load. “Mother nature will heal herself if we give her the tools to do so,” Sheldon said.But that doesn’t mean you’ll be seeing cougars lurking near your favorite mountain trails next week, next month, or even next year. The committee is still figuring out what a feasibility study would need to contain and how to fund it. Murdoch said any study should include an assessment of the habitat across the state that would be suitable for the catamount and where they’d be likely to appear. He also suggested analyzing projected movement patterns with an approach called “circuit analysis” that maps potential pathways the animal might take from protected area to protected area. Food availability is another big factor to consider. Murdoch estimated that one mountain lion eats somewhere between 14-20 deer a year. Though deer populations in the state are booming now, would they be able to keep up with this top-down pressure after years of predation? A study should address that, he said. Also, it’s important people really understand what reintroduction could mean, and that there is support for reintroduction across the region for the reintroduction of animals that roam across wide areas, Murdoch said. “I think (for) a lot of our folks here, it’s a warm and fuzzy thing, but I don’t think they understand the reality of doing (a reintroduction). The first and foremost question should be, what’s in the best interest of the cougar?” said Rep. Chris Pritchard, R-Pawlet, during the hearing. “Is this really the right thing to do for the cougar?”It’s a question, Sheldon expressed, that gets at the heart of the need for such a study.— Olivia GiegerIn the knowFor roughly 22 months, the former site of the Montpelier Post Office has sat vacant, a lonely looming presence at the corner of State and Elm streets. The building sustained significant damage from the July 2023 flood, when water inundated the streets of Vermont’s capital. It was so hastily vacated that federal employees’ items are still sitting on their desks, creating an “eerie” feeling, according to Jon Copans, executive director of the Montpelier Commission for Recovery and Resilience. Now, the city and state are considering whether it may be worth buying the property at 87 State St. from its owner, the U.S. General Services Administration. The General Services Administration announced it would begin the disposition process in December 2024. On April 21, it sent a letter to Montpelier and the state of Vermont about the possibility of a negotiated sale, similar to a “right of first refusal” for government actors before it becomes available to the general public, Copans said. Read more about how the state and city are weighing the purchase here. — Erin PetenkoOn the moveA marquee infrastructure financing program that’s meant to spur housing in smaller towns has passed a key hurdle in the Legislature – but Gov. Phil Scott, senators and housing boosters say House lawmakers have added too many restrictions for the program to work.“It’s just much too complicated for anyone to understand, and will not be utilized by small communities,” Scott said at his regular Wednesday press conference. “It’s taking a step backwards.”The initiative, called the Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, would allow municipalities or developers to borrow money for infrastructure like water lines, roads and sidewalks for a particular housing project – and then use the increased tax revenue from the development to pay off the infrastructure debt.Read more about the debate over the how to structure the new program here. — Carly BerlinThe Vermont House is reviewing a new version of a bill that would increase the licensing requirement threshold for cottage food producers which passed unanimously in the Vermont Senate on Tuesday.Currently, only food producers with less than $10,000 in annual sales were exempt from licensing fees and health department inspections. The legislation would raise the sales threshold to $30,000.The Senate’s revisions to H.401 introduce a comprehensive cottage food product category, defining low-risk foods that can be produced in home kitchens that will receive licensing exemptions. Eligible products include non-perishable baked goods, candies, jams, pickles and other non-refrigerated items.Liz Wirsing, Director of Food and Lodging at the Vermont Department of Health expressed support for the amended version of the bill in testimony before the house agriculture committee on Wednesday. She called the bill a “compromise,” balancing food producers’ interests with public health concerns.Producers must still file forms with the health department and follow strict guidelines for food preparation, including online food safety training. Canned goods, which were initially excluded from the bill, must meet specific pH and processing standards in order to be sold.“People want to see support for small food enterprises,” Caroline Sherman-Gordon, Legislative Director of Rural Vermont, said in an interview. The cottage food bill would alleviate some of the “bureaucratic” costs many Vermonters see when starting a small business, she said. — Izzy WagnerVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: What would it take to bring cougars back to Vermont?.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mountain-Lion-Cougar-Catamount-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 19:07:31.013777

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota student leaders say they have a lot of unanswered questions after lawmakers passed a law requiring schools to be cellphone-free.
Members of the Superintendent of Public Instruction’s Student Cabinet met Wednesday in Bismarck to discuss new legislation that will affect students. 
Senate Bill 2354, which takes effect Aug. 1, prohibits public school students from having access to cellphones and other electronic devices in school from “bell to bell.”
But the students raised a lot of questions lawmakers may not have considered. Some students said laptops provided by schools are “horrible” and wondered if they could continue using personal laptops to do school work.
Another student said she views digital versions of her textbooks on a tablet so she doesn’t have to carry heavy textbooks all day.
Yet another student said she’ll miss using her phone to access the digital calendar she uses to keep track of homework, after-school practices and appointments.
“I see a lot of uncertainties with a lot of the exceptions the students were bringing up,” said Bridger Rivinius, a junior at Gackle-Streeter Public School. “I feel like it might be a slight overreach for the state government to have to be involved with that.”
Gov. Kelly Armstrong was among the supporters of the bill. He has said it will help the next generation of students emotionally and academically.
Gov. Armstrong advocates for eliminating student cellphone use in public schools

The law requires cellphones to be silenced and stowed away in an inaccessible location during the school day. It gives school boards flexibility to craft their own policies around school-related noninstructional time, such as dances and sporting events. 
It also mandates that school districts collect data to measure the impact of the new policy on student behavior, mental health, disciplinary incidents, school attendance and academic performance.
Gwyn Marback, a facilitator for the student Cabinet, said she expects there will be some “fumbles” as school boards try to address issues with their new policies.
“They (state lawmakers) didn’t think of everything,” Marback said. “Hopefully, there’s common sense when things arise.”
Sophia Johnson, a sophomore at Bismarck Legacy High School, said her school has an open campus policy that allows students to leave school during lunch or a free period, which could be an issue in implementing the policy at her school.
“It might be a bit of a disaster,” Johnson said. “We have the open campus and we really want to focus on the 21st Century learning and that involves using our phones.”
She said some courses, such as media class, require students to use their phones to participate.
“All of that stuff is going to be really inhibited by this,” Johnson said. “It really should be up to the teachers because they know their students the best. They know what’s happening in their classrooms and they know how to work their students.”
Aidan Pelton, a senior at Watford City High School, said his school already implemented a zero tolerance cellphone policy. He said kids still have their phones in school, but fewer than before the policy was implemented.
“I like the bill. I just think there’s going to be a lot of problems with it,” Pelton said. “I don’t really love the less control at the school level. But, I think it is overall a good thing to have no phones in schools.”
Addyson Rademacher-Nyame, an eighth grader at Mandan Middle School, testified in favor of the legislation at the Capitol. She said she finds it encouraging that each school board will be able to craft its own policy.
“It’s going to be very interesting, especially this first try. It’s going to be good to see the positive and negative results of it right away,” Rademacher-Nyame said. 
She said legislative fixes might be needed during the 2027 session to address problems that arise from implementing the bill.
“Every school in North Dakota is different,” she said. “I want to see every angle about how every school developed and adapted to this bill and we’ll go from there.”

Weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy would no longer be covered by California’s health insurance for low-income people under the governor’s proposal.



Popular weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy would no longer be covered by Medi-Cal under a proposal unveiled by Gov. Gavin Newsom Wednesday in an effort to reduce cost overruns in the state health insurance program.
The costly drugs prescribed to fight obesity have been driving up the cost of Medi-Cal, the state program that provides health coverage for low-income Californians. Eliminating coverage for these drugs would save the state $85 million in 2025-26, and up to $680 million by 2028-29, according to the governor’s office. 
Newsom’s proposal will be taken up by the state Legislature as the governor and top legislators tackle a state budget facing a $12 billion deficit.
As proposed, coverage of the drugs would end on Jan. 1, 2026. Medi-Cal patients trying to lose weight would have to pay for the prescriptions themselves, at a cost of more than $1,000 per month, making it unattainable for low-income people.
Some health professionals say the drugs are highly effective at combating obesity, a chronic disease that drives up health care costs because it can lead to many other disorders such as heart disease and diabetes.
An estimated 18 million adults in California are obese or overweight, according to the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. 
“This is a bad decision. The people who are already taking this medication, what’s going to happen to them?” said Liz Helms, president of the California Chronic Care Coalition, a group of health consumer advocacy organizations and providers. 
The California Association of Health Plans said Newsom’s proposal “should send a strong signal to the Legislature that they should reconsider mandating that health plans cover these costly drugs for weight loss without the proper clinical safeguards in place.” 
California is not required by federal law to cover the cost of the weight loss drugs in its Medi-Cal program. Instead, the state opted to include them. Under Newsom’s proposed cuts, when Ozempic is prescribed to treat diabetes, it would still be covered by Medi-Cal.
Newsom’s proposal comes as Wegovy and Ozempic prescriptions among Medi-Cal enrollees are soaring along with overall prescription drug spending. In fiscal year 2023-24, drugs cost Medi-Cal close to $15.2 billion, according to state drug cost reports. That’s about a 10% increase from the previous year. 
Between 2022 and 2023, Wegovy prescriptions in the Medi-Cal program jumped from 15,000 to 181,000, data from the U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services show. Ozempic prescriptions for diabetes and weight loss rose from 178,000 in 2022 to 480,000 in 2023.
In 2023, the latest year for which data is available, Medi-Cal spent about $733 million on both drugs. (This amount does not include the refunds that Medi-Cal received from pharmaceutical companies as part of rebate programs.)
“This is a bad decision. The people who are already taking this medication, what’s going to happen to them?”LIZ HELMS, CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION 
In his budget presentation today, Newsom did not mention the drugs. But he said the state had to “tighten things up” in its massive Medi-Cal program so he proposed several restrictions, including a freeze on Medi-Cal enrollments by people who lack permanent legal immigration status. Medi-Cal covers nearly 15 million Californians.
Earlier this year, the state had to backfill a $6.2 billion shortfall in its Medi-Cal budget to pay providers through the end of June. The Department of Health Care Services, which oversees the Medi-Cal program, cited a number of reasons for going over budget, including the state’s expansion to undocumented immigrants and an increase in prescription drug spending.
Ozempic is primarily used to treat Type 2 diabetes, but some doctors prescribe it for weight loss, too. Wegovy is used only for weight loss. Both are manufactured by Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, and there are no generic versions.
Semaglutide, the active ingredient in both drugs, works by mimicking the GLP-1 hormone, which helps regulate blood sugar and appetite. In an attempt to contain costs, Medi-Cal already limits the quantity of Wegovy that can be dispensed every 28 days to one carton of four pen injectors. Patients inject themselves once a week. 
To qualify for Medi-Cal, a single person’s annual income cannot exceed $21,597. For a family of 4, the threshold is $44,367.

Kseniia Petrova has been held in ICE custody for roughly three months, including for a week at a Vermont prison, after authorities say she failed to declare frog embryo samples when she arrived by plane from France.

Photo by Bob LoCicero/VTDiggerBURLINGTON — A federal judge in Vermont is weighing whether she has the authority over a case of a Harvard Medical School scientist from Russia who claims she is being wrongly held in custody by federal authorities.Chief Judge Christina Reiss heard arguments Wednesday morning in U.S. District Court in Burlington in a case brought by Kseniia Petrova, a genetics researcher. Petrova, 30, has been held in detention since February when, according to court filings, she arrived at Boston Logan International Airport from France and did not properly declare research samples — frog embryos. She was eventually placed in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Petrova, who had her visa revoked by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, was held at Vermont’s women’s prison in South Burlington for about a week before she was transferred to an ICE facility in Louisiana, where she has been held ever since. Petrova’s case is the third high-profile immigration matter to come before federal courts in Vermont since President Donald Trump took office in January. The other cases involved a Columbia University student living in Vermont and a Tufts University student who was held in custody for a short time in the state. Both students have since been ordered released from custody by separate federal judges in Vermont.  Petrova brought her legal action, a habeas petition, in Vermont while still in custody in the state, alleging she was being unlawfully held by federal authorities. The federal government filed a motion seeking to dismiss that complaint, contending that the matter, at least at this point, should be playing out in an immigration court in Louisiana and that the federal court in Vermont lacked jurisdiction.Reiss, the judge, listened during Wednesday’s hearing to more than an hour of arguments on the jurisdictional issue. She said as the hearing came to a close that she was taking the matter under advisement and set a bail hearing in the case for May 28.“I will see you on May 28 at 10, unless I decide that the court has no authority to go forward,” Reiss told the attorneys as the hearing came to a close. “We may even have the hearing anyway, and I will tell you what I’ve determined with regard to that.”Throughout the hearing, the judge challenged the positions of attorneys on both sides of the case, often interjecting questions as they spoke.Reiss, speaking to Jeff Hartman, a trial attorney from the U.S Department of Justice who represented the Trump administration at Wednesday’s hearing, said an immigration court process could take months or years to play out.“This is not going to happen anytime soon,” Reiss said to Hartman, adding, “And if she is, in fact, unlawfully detained, that’s exactly what a habeas petition is for.”“If she believes that her removal proceedings, which are ongoing in Louisiana, are unlawful or contrary to the Constitution, you know, she can bring a claim,” Hartman replied. “We think the proper venue for that question is Louisiana, where she’s detained.”Reiss questioned that response. “But in this case, her habeas petition was filed here when she was here,” Reiss said. “And, the Supreme Court has said, ‘Yeah, even if you move somebody the court retains habeas jurisdiction,’” the judge added. “Otherwise it would create an adverse, perverse incentive to move somebody around the country and say, ‘Oh, now you’ve got to file in Louisiana. Oh, you’re in Ohio now, file there.’” Petrova took part in Wednesday’s hearing remotely from the ICE facility in Louisiana where she has been detained for the past three months. The courtroom gallery in Burlington was filled with her supporters, several wearing clothing emblazoned with “Harvard.” The case has received national media attention, and an essay from Petrova appeared this week in the New York Times titled “I Came to Study Aging. Now I’m Trapped in ICE Detention.” In the initial filing in federal court in Vermont, Petrova’s attorney described the incident leading to her custody as an “inadvertent failure to declare on a customs form non-hazardous, noninfectious, and non-toxic frog embryos that she was bringing to the United States at the request” of a leader of a researcher group at Harvard Medical School “under whose leadership she works.” Such cases, according to Petrova’s attorney Gregory Romanovsky, often result in a fine and the forfeiture of the undeclared items.  Petrova, the filing stated, had entered the United States on a valid visa in May 2023 and had been conducting “groundbreaking scientific research” at Harvard. She had traveled in and out of the country several times since then without issue, the filing added. She traveled to Europe in late January, her attorney stated in the filing, and prior to her return, a leader of a research group at Harvard asked her to bring back samples of frog embryos from his scientific collaborators at the Institut Curie Centre de Recherche in France.“She simply placed the samples in her luggage and did not declare them to CBP at the time of her entry” to the United States at Boston Logan International Airport, according to the filing. At the luggage conveyor belt, the filing stated, Petrova was approached by a CBP officer and escorted to a room for questioning and examination of luggage.After finding the undeclared items, “and despite her attempts to explain,” the CBP officer marked her visa in her passport as “cancelled,” according to Petrova’s attorney. The officer then gave Petrova a choice, the filing stated, to withdraw her application for admission and apply for a new visa from overseas or face expedited removal and the possibility of being barred from admission to the United States for five years.She asked that her application be withdrawn and requested to return to Paris, according to the filing. Petrova, the filing stated, said she had no fear of returning to France, but “did have a fear of returning to Russia, where she faced past persecution for her political activities.” The filing then stated, “CBP subsequently apprehended and detained” Petrova.Petrova, in her New York Times essay, stated that she had been arrested in Russia for protesting the war in Ukraine.  In a statement, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Petrova was “lawfully” detained after “lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country.” The statement added, “A subsequent K9 inspection uncovered undeclared petri dishes, containers of unknown substances, and loose vials of embryonic frog cells, all without proper permits.”Petrova, in a court filing, denied the allegation of lying to federal officers, and her attorney reiterated that denial during Wednesday’s hearing.Judge Reiss asked Hartman during the hearing Wednesday if the federal government was ultimately seeking to deport Petrova to Russia.“Yes,” Hartman responded. Romanovsky, Petrova’s attorney, said after the hearing Wednesday that he looked forward to a bail hearing for his client later this month in federal court in Vermont. “We’ll ask for Ms. Petrova to be present at the bail hearing in person,” he said. “We’ll have an opportunity to present witnesses to show that she is not a danger to the community and not a flight risk.” Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont federal judge hears arguments in case of detained Harvard scientist from Russia .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Champlain-College-4-24-18-750363-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-14 19:07:31.013777

(Photo by Getty Images)Both chambers of the Iowa Legislature passed changes to Iowa’s unemployment insurance taxes Wednesday, sending Gov. Kim Reynolds’ proposal to her for final approval.
Senate File 607, brought forward by Reynolds early in the 2025 legislative session, would cut the taxable wage base used to calculate unemployment insurance taxes in half from 66.7% to 33.4%.
 It includes other changes, like reducing Iowa’s unemployment tax tables, and excludes wages paid from employers to employees working in other states from the definition of “taxable wages” if the other state extends reciprocity to Iowa.
The bill passed the Senate 32-16 and the House 59-27. In the House, Rep. David Young, R-Van Meter, said Iowa is in a good position when looking at the amount of money in the state’s Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund — $1.95 billion — but said there have been questions “legitimately” raised about what would happen to the fund in the case of a recession or economic downturn. 
Though the bill contains decreases to the taxes going to this fund by decreasing the taxable wage base, Young said changes to the tax rate are triggered under current law — and retained in the bill –if the balance of the fund falls below $941 million.

“Our state’s unemployment rate is 3.4%, and with an unemployment insurance trust fund at almost $2 billion, the sound argument is being made that we’ve been over-collecting — especially compared to other states,” Young said. “The proposal before us saves employers and businesses approximately $975 million over five years, injecting that back into the private sector.”
Democrats proposed multiple amendments in both chambers, including measures to reverse Iowa’s cuts to unemployment in recent years, each of which failed. One Senate amendment would have waived work search requirements for people with seasonal employment.
In the Senate, lawmakers opposing the legislation said it does not help workers but benefits the companies that lay them off, causing residents to find work in another state rather than try to figure out a complicated, burdensome system that won’t provide aid for as long as they need. 
“Our unemployment system is rigged for the employers, particularly with this bill,” Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Marion, said. “It is the workers who hold those businesses up, and we need to do better by those workers, not give more breaks to the employers who are laying them off.” 
Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said he was “ashamed” of Senate Republicans for how they’re treating workers with the legislation by not allowing more time to take advantage of benefits and helping businesses more than employees. 
Providing unemployment insurance to Iowans doesn’t mean they’re just being handed a check, Dotzler said, it means they have the time to better themselves for employment while they seek it and won’t have to worry as much about finances in the process. 
One of the House Democrats’ amendments proposed requiring savings for employers through the bill be used to increase employee salaries or benefits — a suggestion, not requirement, under the current legislation.
Democrats argued during debate on the bill in the House the unemployment funds need to be available for Iowans in need, and that businesses should not necessarily be trusted to use tax savings on better compensation for workers. Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, said “the reason the fund is full in the first place is because this body, the majority party, voted to strip workers’ benefits.”
“The money in this fund was never meant to go back to the big corporations,” James said. “It was meant to go to workers, and that’s where it should be going. … This isn’t policy. It is corporate theft.”
Young said most of the claims made by Democrats were factually inaccurate, saying the measure does not provide an “corporate income tax break,” and does not cut any unemployment benefits.
Sen. Adrian Dickey, R-Packwood, called concerns brought up by Democrats “old, tired talking points,” and said the problems they worried about with previous unemployment legislation have not come to fruition. Iowa’s population grew between 2023-2024, he said, countering statements that Iowa is losing workers in favor of going to other states with better pay, benefits and unemployment programs. 
For the lawmakers who said the process to apply for unemployment is too complicated, harming those who need aid, Dickey said they’d be happy to know that Iowa Workforce Development will launch updated websites and materials this summer. 
Dickey acknowledged there are flaws in the current system, including the state’s unemployment fund, and said the Legislature should take time next year to take a hard look at how unemployment works in the state. However, Iowa is third in the nation for average weekly rate of benefits at just over nine weeks. He asked why Iowa would want to be like its neighbors, which have longer averages. 
“The Republican Party has been the party to stand up for Iowa workers,” Dickey said. “We are the party that wants our workers to aspire more than desiring an unemployment check.”
Reynolds released a statement celebrating both chambers passing the measure.
“Passing this bill means nearly $1 billion in savings over five years for Iowa businesses of all sizes,” the governor said in a statement. “Thank you to our legislators and key stakeholders for their support to help attract new business to Iowa and place existing businesses on a level playing field with our neighboring states.”

The bills that passed included Legislative Bill 383, from State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, requiring that, starting in July 2026, anyone wishing to create a social media account in Nebraska must prove they are 18 years old or older. Younger users would need parental permission. A parent would also need to prove they are 18 years old or older.

LB 383 also includes the provisions of LB 172, from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, outlawing using artificial intelligence or computer generation to create pornographic images or videos depicting someone younger than 18 years old, or knowingly and intentionally receiving such content.
Both measures were priorities of Gov. Jim Pillen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers, as was LB 140 from State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue.
LB 140 would require all of Nebraska’s 245 school districts to prohibit student use of cellphones and other personal electronic communication devices during most parts of the school day beginning this fall. School districts would retain wide latitude in implementing such a policy. Most already have one.
LB 383 passed 46-3. LB 140 passed 48-1.

Lawmakers also approved LB 246, from State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara at Pillen’s request, to ban the sale of lab-grown meat. Some lawmakers, including conservative State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, as well as the Nebraska Farm Bureau, preferred to label rather than ban the products, which aren’t currently available in Nebraska markets.
LB 246 passed 38-11 and would take effect three months after lawmakers adjourn. The last day is scheduled for June 9.
Lawmakers also advanced housing supports for survivors of domestic violence and sex trafficking through LB 78, from State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln. It would increase the documentary stamp tax by 7 cents per $1,000 worth of property, which is on the transfer of real estate, a portion of which the state uses for affordable housing or homeless shelter assistance.
All new revenue would be directed to the new housing assistance. It passed 49-0 and would take effect three months after adjournment.

Senators also passed LB 559, from State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, to outlaw unauthorized skimming devices and “kingpins” who use them, such as on ATMs, point-of-sale systems or fuel pumps. It passed 43-6.
The bill included LB 464, also from Bosn, a former prosecutor, to outlaw “organized retail crime,” a step up from strings of shoplifting depending on the value of merchandise stolen.
Other bills that passed on Wednesday include:

LB 32, from State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, to allow candidates to use a post office box instead of a street address on political advertisements. A street address would still need to be on file with state officials. Passed 47-2.
LB 36, from State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, to establish the “Safe Battery Collection and Recycling Act” to collect and safely dispose of certain batteries, increase fees on Nebraska Game and Parks Commission park entry permits and expand allowable water recreation projects. Passed 43-6.
LB 80, from State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, would consolidate laws related to protection orders, extend ordered protection orders and renewals to two years instead of one, require child abuse involving a military family to be reported to the service member’s military installation and require landlords to change locks or remove a perpetrator of domestic violence from a rental agreement soon after abuse is documented and a protective or restraining order has been granted. Passed 46-3.
LB 133, from State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, to expand the definition of “law enforcement officer” to include animal control officers to enforce state or local animal control laws if authorized by a city, village or county. Passed 42-7.
LB 166, from State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, to require county treasurers to conceal the addresses of law enforcement, members of the Nebraska National Guard or judges if such a person applies to have their address withheld, which is currently the law for county assessors. Addresses for judges would also be concealed when they are up for retention elections. Passed 48-1.
LB 230, also from Hallstrom, to restrict and regulate the sale of kratom to those 21 years of age or older, classify tianeptine (“gas station heroin”) as a Schedule II controlled substance and prohibit the sale of nitrous oxide (laughing gas). Passed 49-0.
LB 257, from State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, creates a pathway for marriage and family therapists from other states to be licensed in Nebraska and increases the minimum liability coverage needed for child care licensing. Passed 46-3.

LB 526, from State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, to allow a public power supplier to pass on costs to or require additional terms and conditions of cryptocurrency mining operations, including if the operation necessitates infrastructure upgrades. Passed 49-0.
LB 561, also from Brandt, would create a special permit for overweight vehicles carrying raw milk up to 107,500 pounds. The Nebraska Department of Transportation would need to create a list of bridges that would and would not support the weight. Passed 49-0.
LB 660, from State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, would require state agencies to regularly review regulations and repeal unnecessary rules, mandate an updated inventory of federal funds the state relies on along with contingency plans in the event of reductions in federal support and permit legal challenges against rules or regulations in local district courts rather than only in Lancaster County. Passed 49-0.

(Courtesy of FM)A late-in-session bill aimed at helping Johnston-based insurance company FM is prompting new whispers down the State House’s marbled halls: Is Rhode Island at risk of losing another top employer?
Just the opposite, says Rep. Alex Finkelman, a Jamestown Democrat who introduced the House bill May 8 at the request of the Fortune 500 company, which rebranded from FM Global in July 2024. Gov. Dan McKee has also put his name behind the bill.
Finkelman confirmed in an interview that privately held FM, with its 8-acre Johnston corporate campus and 1,500-person state workforce (totaling 5,500 employees worldwide), is considering expanding its local presence. 
That’s why FM CEO Malcolm Roberts met with House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi in April to ask for legislation lifting restrictions on its investment abilities. Shekarchi said he later received a similar request from executives with Amica Mutual Insurance Co., based in Lincoln.
Shekarchi, typically noncommittal on legislation prior to a committee hearing, did not hesitate to show his support for the bill ahead of its initial hearing scheduled for Thursday, May 15, before the House Committee on Corporations.
“I appreciate dialogue from companies on ways the state can improve the business climate and level the playing field with neighboring states,” Shekarchi said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “I look forward to seeing this bill pass into law before the session concludes in June.”
The focus on keeping up with neighboring states sharpened for lawmakers and business leaders in the last year, after two major private companies, Citizens and Hasbro Inc., threatened to leave Rhode Island for Massachusetts.
Hasbro executives now expect to to provide an update on a potential relocation to Massachusetts this summer, while Citizens appears content to stay put after state lawmakers shepherded through a tax rewrite for its benefit in the 2024 legislative session.
The Citizens Bank bill, rushed through both chambers and signed into law in the final throes of the 2024 session, drew criticism from a small group of progressive lawmakers, who bristled at loss of state tax revenue ($15 million for a full fiscal year) to further boost the bottom line of a major financial services company.
Executives at FM have no plans to leave, despite a state law enacted in 1984 restricting its investments in long-term assets outside of stocks and bonds. Such nontraditional or alternative assets, currently limited to no more than 10% of total assets, could include hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate holdings. Finkelman’s bill would repeal the investment cap, letting local insurers invest as much as they want in what are referred to in federal reporting rules as Schedule BA investments.
“FM welcomes this proposal, which we believe will help support business growth and competitiveness in Rhode Island and enable insurance companies in the state to manage their investments with greater flexibility without compromising policyholder protection,” Rob Julavits, a spokesperson for FM, said in an email.
Julavits remained vague when asked about the company’s expansion plans in Rhode Island.
“FM is one of the largest private employers in Rhode Island,” Julavits said. “The company continues to grow and is currently hiring for a variety of roles. We believe this legislation would give us additional flexibility to support growth in Rhode Island, which has been home to our headquarters for nearly 200 years.”
Finkelman, owner and president of Warwick-based insurance agency The Egis Group, said FM’s cutting edge research, development and insurance of niche areas like solar panels and renewable energy could lead to new jobs for Rhode Islanders.
Keeping up with neighbors 
The bill also puts Rhode Island in line with neighboring states, a selling point for McKee.
“The Governor is committed to creating a level playing field for local companies, which is why he submitted this legislation to lift investment caps placed on Rhode Island-based insurance companies,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee, said in an email. “Repealing these limits would align our state with Massachusetts and Connecticut, making Rhode Island a more attractive place to do business and ensuring our domestic insurers can compete on equal footing with their regional competitors.”
Massachusetts and Connecticut are among 10 states that do not limit investment in Schedule BA assets, Matt Touchette, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation, said in an email.
Touchette referred questions about past investment limits in Massachusetts and Connecticut to their states’ respective business regulators. Mary Quinn, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Insurance Department, confirmed via email Wednesday that the state does not limit Schedule BA investments. However, a separate clause in Connecticut’s laws for insurers restricts company stock investments in a single institution at 5%, and non-stock investments in a single institution at 25% of assets.
The Massachusetts Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation, which oversees insurance for the Commonwealth, did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment on Wednesday.
Repealing restrictions on local insurance companies’ investments might indirectly help consumers who could see premiums drop if the companies can improve their bottom lines, Finkelman said. By that same logic, if company profits suffer under riskier investment strategies, it might also hurt their policyholders.
However, state business regulators limit how much insurance companies can charge consumers, offering protections against dramatic premium spikes.
FM posted a nearly $3.4 billion profit on $8.1 billion in revenue in 2024, according to its annual report. It does not publicly report the number of policyholders, primarily commercial and industrial customers.
Amica posted an $84 million profit in 2024, according to unaudited financial statements.

“This change will help us manage our investments more effectively, allowing us to deliver stronger, more reliable support for our policyholders when they need us most,” Dowling said.
Dowling did not specify whether lifting the investment cap could reduce consumer costs for Amica’s 1.2 million policies, which center on individual insurance products like auto, home and life insurance.
Origins of 1984 law a mystery 
No one contacted for this story could answer why Rhode Island limited investment caps for insurers in the first place. Finkelman suggested hedge funds might have seemed too risky to lawmakers in the 1980s.
But nontraditional or alternative investments are now commonly accepted across industries, Finkelman said.
“FM and Amica are two of the most financially sound insurance companies,” he said. “I  have very little concern about them running into financial trouble by overleveraging themselves.”










FM and Amica are two of the most financially sound insurance companies. I  have very little concern about them running into financial trouble by overleveraging themselves.


– Rep. Alex Finkelman, a Jamestown Democrat


Insurance companies have been steadily increasing investments in alternative assets since at least 2010, searching for higher returns in a low-interest rate environment. The appeal of alternate asset classes increased further after 2017 regulatory changes adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which reformed how companies could record exchange-traded funds on their balance sheets. 
Julavits declined to answer questions about the timing of the company’s requested state legislation — three months after the Feb. 5 deadline for state lawmakers to submit new bills under standard procedure during the 2025 session.
Even after Shekarchi met with FM in April, it took several weeks before the proposed legislation made its debut on the House floor.
“Nothing in government moves fast,” Finkelman said.
Lawmakers will have to act quickly to advance the bill before the session ends on or before June 30. 
A Senate companion bill sponsored by Sen. Andrew Dimitri, a Johnston Democrat, was introduced on Friday. A hearing has not been scheduled yet, Greg Pare, a Senate spokesperson said.
Senate President Valarie Lawson signaled preliminary support.
“Amica Mutual Insurance and FM Global (sic) are both longstanding, valued corporate citizens in Rhode Island,” Lawson said in an emailed statement. “While the specifics of the proposal to remove the investment cap will be reviewed through the public committee process, I am open to the idea. It appears that this would create a more welcoming, business-friendly environment and improve opportunities for job creation at no cost or risk to the state. I look forward to reviewing the specifics and continuing to work with the business community to help existing Rhode Island companies grow here and to attract new companies to our state.”

While performers put traditional dances on display in the Capitol rotunda, multiple booths offered information and advice for encounters with law enforcement as federal authorities ratchet up immigrant arrests and deportations.
Latino legislators, local business owners and faith leaders met with Oklahoma’s Republican governor on Wednesday about immigration policies and Oklahoma’s reliance on immigrant labor.

Arturo Alonso-Sandoval, D-Oklahoma City, during a news conference of the Oklahoma Legislative Latino Caucus on Wednesday at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City.

Latino lawmakers’ biggest ask, Sen. Michael Brooks said, was for the governor to follow through with his opposition to the Oklahoma State Department of Education’s proposal to have public schools collect students’ immigration status. Gov. Kevin Stitt previously pledged to block the proposed rule, saying “putting kids on a list is not something we should do.”
“That was well received,” Brooks, D-Oklahoma City, said. “The governor has continued to be able to maintain that he’s committed to making sure those rules do not go into effect.”
State Superintendent Ryan Walters has said he proposed the rule to better account for resources needed to serve immigrant students. He also said his administration would share the collected information with the federal government, if asked, and would support immigration raids in schools.
A resolution that passed the state Senate this week would reject the rule. It now advances to the House for consideration.

Stitt said he heard from leaders of various industries during the roundtable meeting Wednesday that the proposed rule had made some Oklahoma families “really, really scared and nervous about sending their kids to school.”
“They were just asking me to help them on that (and) be able to protect the young people in the state of Oklahoma,” Stitt said. “It’s a complicated issue. It’s an issue that normally is a political issue that nobody on my side of the aisle would jump in and say, ‘Hey, let’s attack this.’ So, I knew it was going to be political and people were going to come after me for it, but it’s the right thing to do.”
Stitt’s stance on the issue was a balm for families in Santa Fe South Schools, an Oklahoma City charter district where about 97% of the student body is Hispanic, said the district’s superintendent, Chris Brewster.
But, the district’s community is still experiencing crises and heightened anxiety with the growing number of deportations, Brewster said.

A month ago, he said, a Santa Fe South fifth grader learned his mother and other members of her roofing crew had been placed in immigration detention. Brewster said the boy and his mother had entered the country to seek asylum from violence in Honduras.
He said school officials scrambled to get in touch with the 11 year old’s mother, who is now slated for deportation, and to contact his estranged father, who now has custody of the child.
“This is not an isolated issue, and we have hundreds of these stories in our community,” Brewster said. “As a conservative Christian and an American, I don’t find this to be tenable, the way that we treat children, those that have been made in God’s image, that they should go through this type of turmoil and tragedy because of what’s taking place in our immigration system.”
The Oklahoma Legislative Latino Caucus, though in agreement with Stitt on the Education Department’s proposed rule, continues to oppose a bill the governor signed into law last year to create the state crime of “impermissible occupation.”
Scores of Latino Oklahomans gathered at the Capitol last year on Hispanic Cultural Day to protest the policy. A lawsuit challenging the law was refiled this week.
Wednesday’s festivities were a far cry from the large-scale protest that took place last year. With the added fears that the immigrant community now faces, Brooks said “having a huge event on the steps of the Capitol wasn’t the right thing to do this year.”

To meet uncertain times with music and dancing is a testament to the community’s temperament, said Rep. Annie Menz, D-Norman, a member of the Latino caucus who founded the Hispanic Cultural Day event.
“Whenever we feel like our community is coming under attack, it’s up to us to fight back,” Menz said. “We will remain prayerful that those (attacks) remain few and far between, and it’s in that spirit that we wanted to go back to our original format for this event and kind of lighten it a little bit and remind people we are no threat. Our community is no threat. We are your neighbors. We are your friends, we are your coworkers.”

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Two Arkansas ballot question committees on Wednesday filed a motion to intervene in a federal lawsuit challenging new direct democracy-related laws. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, Elias Law Group LLP and Shults Law Firm LLP filed the motion in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas on behalf of For AR Kids and Protect AR Rights. The former is a grassroots coalition that’s received approval from the attorney general to gather signatures for its proposed education-focused constitutional amendment. 
The latter plans to file its own proposed ballot initiative for the 2026 election to protect Arkansans’ “right to propose, sign, petition and campaign for ballot initiatives to improve their communities,” according to a Statement of Organization filed with the Arkansas Ethics Commission Friday. 
Protect AR Rights is composed of several groups, including Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, Arkansas Appleseed, Arkansas Citizens First Congress, Arkansas Public Policy Panel, the Arkansas State Conference of the NAACP and For AR People.
“This case is about protecting core political speech,” ACLU of Arkansas Legal Director John Williams said in a statement. “Arkansas voters have a constitutional right to speak out, organize, and propose laws through the ballot initiative process. The laws we’re challenging are deliberate efforts to suppress that speech and silence the voices of ordinary Arkansans in favor of entrenched political power.”
Arkansas attorney general rejects first ballot measure under new law

The original lawsuit was filed last month by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas who alleges eight recently approved laws governing direct democracy violate the First and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The case is assigned to Judge Timothy Brooks.
Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote through the direct democracy process. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allows citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The majority of the laws challenged in the lawsuit regulate the petition-gathering portion of the initiative and referendum process. New requirements include directing signature gatherers, known as canvassers, to sign a “true affidavit,” to request a photo ID from potential signers and inform them that petition fraud is a criminal offense, among other things. 
According to Wednesday’s court filings, the intervenors want to challenge additional laws, including a 2023 law that requires petitioners to gather signatures from 50 counties instead of 15 counties and Act 602 of 2025, which prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth grade reading level. Attorney General Tim Griffin cited the new law for the first time when he rejected a proposed ballot measure from the League of Women Voters last week. 
In Wednesday’s filings, the plaintiffs argue that intervening in the League of Women Voters lawsuit is more efficient than filing a separate lawsuit, which they said would likely be consolidated with the League’s complaint under federal court rules. 


Let us know what you think...


 

Legislators and supporters of the new laws have said they will bring integrity to the initiative and referendum process, while opponents argue they will make it nearly impossible for citizens’ proposals to qualify for the ballot. Protect AR Rights spokesperson Bill Kopsky called the laws “a blatant power grab by politicians trying to silence voters.”
“Direct democracy has been under attack in the Arkansas Legislature really since 2012,” he said. “Passing just bill after bill, it’s death by 1,000 paper cuts, making the process harder for people.”
For AR Rights formed in 2020 in opposition to Issue 3, a proposed constitutional amendment referred by the Legislature that would have changed the initiative and referendum process by requiring voter petitions to be submitted earlier and increasing the number of counties where signatures must be collected, among other things. Issue 3 failed with 56% voting against it.
Two years later, For AR Rights fought against Issue 2, another lawmaker-referred constitutional amendment that would have increased the percentage of votes required to pass constitutional amendments and citizen-proposed state laws from a majority to 60% of votes cast. Issue 2 failed with 59% of voters voting against it.
Arkansas AG certifies education coalition’s 2026 ballot proposal

Kopsky is also part of For AR Kids, which submitted and received approval for its proposed constitutional amendment for the 2026 general election after failing to collect enough signatures for the 2024 election.
After the conclusion of the 2025 legislative session, Kopsky said the group assessed the new laws and volunteers tried collecting some signatures to learn how difficult it would be to comply with the new requirements. The regulations were “so onerous that it’s nearly impossible to collect signatures,” which is why the group decided to seek to join the League of Women Voters’ lawsuit, he said.
“We just view ballot measures as a fundamental right in the Constitution, obviously, but we also see it as a way to cut through the partisanship that is caused by our politicians and special interests,” Kopsky said. “Arkansans tend not to be super political, which I love about us. It’s not about what camp you’re in, it’s what can we do to make our community better.”

Joseph Bellino (R-Monroe) told a large crowd outside the State Capitol Building Wednesday during the annual Unite to Face Addiction rally.
Bellino has been vocal about his struggles with addiction prior to his time in the Legislature, telling attendees there is a lot of shame in addiction and making mistakes because addiction, but there is pride in recovery.
“This is my favorite day of the year, when addicts outnumber assholes in Lansing,” Bellino said.

In Bellino’s first year as a lawmaker, he told the crowd that he befriended another legislator, a Democrat, and the pair would go to recovery meetings together, staying sober together. But the other state representative ultimately lost their fight with addiction, killing themselves in 2017.
About 17% of Americans aged 12 or older have experienced a substance abuse disorder, according to the 2023 report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In Michigan, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, or MDHHS, reported in 2024 that through efforts to provide harm reduction resources and recovery opportunities, Michigan’s overdose death rate declined five times faster than the national average.
Attendees listened to live music, laid flowers on the Capitol steps in honor of those who have experienced addiction and heard speakers advocate for hope in recovery.
The fight against addiction is a statewide fight, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, a Democratic candidate for governor, told the crowd and there needs to be belief in recovery, that generations of addiction can be broken if communities work together.
That’s the soul of the IGNITE program in the Flint area, Swanson said. IGNITE, which stands for Inmate Growth Naturally and Intentionally Through Education is a program in correctional facilities across the country that Swanson created to offer educational opportunities to those who’ve interacted with the justice system to have opportunities in the workforce. This week, Genesee County saw its 100th GED earned through the program since it launched in 2020.

“Keep fighting, fighting for the people, giving hope to people, believing in people, that’s what’s going to free people… not one person… on this stage, not one person on this lawn has not been touched by the disease of addiction and you are the one that needs to stand in the gap. So if you do your part, I do my part. We do our part, we will save lives every single day,” Swanson said.
Sobriety is an everyday commitment for many who’ve experienced addiction and not enough attention is paid to the level of grit and hope that’s required to take on the challenge of overcoming addiction, Chris Nixon, an addiction medicine specialist at Henry Ford Health told the crowd.
Reflecting the journey of his wife, who has been clean from opioid addiction for eight years and the loss of his father and brother to addiction, Nixon said there is honor in fighting against addiction.
Relapse is not defeat in addiction, Nixon said, perfection is not required, only a willingness to reset and start again. At a gathering of addicts and supporters like the Unite to Face Addiction rally, Nixon said there’s likely attendees that have relapsed within the last 48 hours, but their decision to attend a rally where several recovery organizations are offering contact info and advocates are ready to support is a testament to their commitment to strive towards sobriety again.

Housing advocates say a cap on the amount of state tax revenue set aside for the new CHIP program would severely limit the number of homes that could be built with its help, among concerns about other restrictions.

Emile Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, speaks as the House Ways and Means Committee takes testimony at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Tuesday, April 8. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.A marquee infrastructure financing program that’s meant to spur housing in smaller towns has passed a key hurdle in the Legislature – but Gov. Phil Scott, senators and housing boosters say House lawmakers have added too many restrictions for the program to work.“It’s just much too complicated for anyone to understand, and will not be utilized by small communities,” Scott said at his regular Wednesday press conference. “It’s taking a step backwards.”The initiative, called the Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, would allow municipalities or developers to borrow money for infrastructure like water lines, roads and sidewalks for a particular housing project – and then use the increased tax revenue from the development to pay off the infrastructure debt.Proponents say it provides a new avenue to pay for costly public infrastructure – without the Legislature or municipalities needing to cut a check, or developers baking the cost into the price of housing. Critics have argued the tax incentive’s benefits don’t outweigh the foregone property tax revenue to the state’s overstretched Education Fund. In that vein, the House Committee on Ways and Means placed a $40 million annual limit on the amount of tax increment dedicated to housing project debt before advancing the bill on Wednesday.But housing advocates say that cap severely limits the number of homes that could be built through the program amid Vermont’s acute housing shortage.“Why do we want to cap the ability to see that housing growth happen, especially if we’re using this program to incentivize it in smart-growth areas, whether that’s rural or urban?” said Megan Sullivan, a lobbyist for the Vermont Chamber of Commerce.The tax-writing panel also added a test that would occur as part of each housing project application to determine whether a project would not have occurred without financing from the program. “There’s actually development happening all over the state,” said Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, who chairs the committee. “We want to make sure that we aren’t putting public dollars towards projects that would happen regardless.”READ MORE
Yet CHIP’s proponents point out that Vermont is currently building less than half the homes needed annually in order to meet demand, ease housing vacancy rates and make progress on eliminating homelessness, based on several recent projections.House lawmakers also added a host of other rules to the program, including floor-area minimums for housing, location criteria, affordability incentives, and additional layers of oversight. Their version of the bill also sunsets Vermont’s existing tax-increment financing program in 2028, a move intended to assess its usefulness going forward, Kornheiser said.Taken together, the CHIP’s proponents say the House’s direction curbs access to the program too severely.“We would probably say they have put maybe so many guardrails in place that it keeps people out of being able to participate,” said Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast. The housing package that contains CHIP still needs to clear the House floor. After that, Ram Hinsdale said she expects the bill to ultimately land in a conference committee, where House and Senate lawmakers can hash out their differences of opinion.“This is by far the most significant housing action in front of the Legislature this session,” said Miro Weinberger, former Burlington mayor and executive chair of Let’s Build Homes, a new housing advocacy group that has thrown its weight behind the CHIP proposal. If lawmakers fumble the policy, he said, it “would just be a breathtaking legislative failure.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  This year’s main Vermont housing policy gets mired in legislative disagreement .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/emilie-kornheiser-1-20250408-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-14 18:08:50.666591

SPRINGFIELD — Gov. JB Pritzker’s office is now projecting state revenues to come in about a half-billion dollars below the baseline projections assumed during his February budget address.

The latest downward revision comes as lawmakers are entering the final two-week stretch to approve a budget before their May 31 deadline amid increasing economic uncertainty.

While Pritzker’s office blamed changes made by the Trump administration for revenue shortfalls, the new fiscal reality is almost certain to make passing a budget more difficult as lawmakers are forced to consider approving new revenue streams or cutting state programs to make up the difference.

The Governor’s Office of Management and Budget lowered revenue projections for fiscal year 2026, which begins July 1, by $536 million from its February estimate. It’s a 1% decrease that puts the state on track to finish FY26 with $54.9 billion in revenue.

The change “is largely driven by the economic uncertainty and anxiety fueled by the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress,” Deputy Gov. Andy Manar said in a statement.

“Their reckless economic policies have already triggered the first quarterly decline in the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in three years and are driving up costs for working families,” Manar added. “This growing national instability poses a serious risk to Illinois’ continued economic progress and outlook.”

Income tax, federal funding changes

Projections for income and sales tax revenue in FY26 were lowered by 1% since February while corporate income tax expectations decreased by nearly 7%.

GOMB’s projection more closely aligns with a revision issued earlier this month by the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability, the General Assembly’s bipartisan forecasting commission. COGFA’s May 2 forecast projects FY26 will see $54.5 billion in revenue, compared to the $54.9 billion forecast by GOMB.

The roughly $400 million difference between COGFA’s and GOMB’s is driven by the fact that GOMB’s latest estimate includes tax code changes sought by the governor that will raise revenue beyond what’s in current law. Pritzker proposed a tax increase on electronic gambling and table games at casinos, pausing a transfer of sales tax revenue from motor fuel sales to the road fund, and providing temporary amnesty for individuals making delinquent tax payments.

Pritzker’s office decreased federal revenue expectations for FY26 by about 2%, but COGFA lowered expectations by more than 6%.

Pritzker in February proposed a $55.2 billion spending plan that would be fueled by $55.5 billion in revenue, including the proposed revenue changes. But now lawmakers must work to fit their spending priorities into a smaller window that was already tight. Pritzker’s introduced budget called for 1% spending growth in most areas of the budget outside education, pensions and health care costs.

Senate Democrats’ budget leader, Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, said he believes the governor’s office’s adjustment keeps with its recent tradition of “responsible and conservative revenue estimating” and that Pritzker was not too aggressive when he introduced his budget in February.

“It was looking at the information available at the time,” Sims said in an interview. “He made an adjustment call. After having more real data, he changed the estimate to reflect that.”

House Republicans’ budget leader, Rep. Amy Elik, R-Godfrey, said Pritzker’s adjustment was “sensible,” but he should have been aware of President Donald Trump’s plans and accounted for their effects when he introduced his budget. She added the state budget has also relied too much on federal funds to pay for state programs.

“We are now in a situation where we have so much reliance on the federal government that any little cut feels like a very big deal to Illinois,” Elik said in an interview.

Special session needed?

The Trump administration has made the budgeting process “much more difficult,” Sims said, and it is possible lawmakers will need to come back later this year to make changes to any budget passed this month.

“We have no idea what the federal government is going to do,” Sims said. “This is the most uncertainty we’ve had in a very long time. So it’s possible. Is it the preferred outcome? Absolutely not, but is it a possibility? Sure.”

Both Sims and Elik said lawmakers need to look closely at what the state is spending to make decisions about how to balance the budget with minimal revenue growth and without hurting key services.

""We’re looking at every line,” Sims said. “This is that point of the session where we gather information.”

Some Republicans are seeking to slash significant portions of the state budget. Rep. Jed Davis, R-Newark, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, suggested the budget could be reduced by $10 billion, but many of his recommendations eliminate capital projects that are not part of the $55 billion general fund budget. He also suggested reducing  pension contributions that are required by law.

Elik was more measured when discussing potential cuts.

“You can’t just do an across-the-board reduction of state spending,” she said. “I wouldn’t recommend that in any way. So I think you go department by department and line by line.”

Projections for the current FY25 budget that ends June 30 remain largely in line with expectations on the revenue end, although spending has outpaced revenues.

Both COGFA and GOMB expect the state will close the year with $53.9 billion in revenue, though corporate and sales tax income will end slightly lower than expected.

Spending for the year is so far trending 4% higher than what lawmakers budgeted for, according to GOMB, but nearly all of this comes from higher-than-expected pension payments. Recently enacted state law allows the comptroller to “pre-pay” pensions, meaning the comptroller can make pension payments earlier in the fiscal year. Generally speaking, that means spending could fall more in line with revenues as the fiscal year progresses.

Further cuts from Congress?

Congressional budget talks taking place this month could mean further cuts to federal funding for the state.

Congress is considering a plan that includes some substantial cuts to Medicaid and federal health care programs, including a 10% cut to the federal matching rate for states that provide health care coverage for undocumented immigrants.

Pritzker proposed eliminating a health care program for noncitizens ages 42-64 to save the state $330 million in FY26, but a $132 million program covering seniors remained in his proposal.

Pritzker has long warned the state will not be able to make up for any significant Medicaid cuts approved by Congress.

“The Governor has made it clear: he will only sign a balanced budget,” Manar said. “At the same time, he has warned of the devastating impact on working families if Trump and Congressional Republicans succeed in their cruel cuts (to) Medicaid, SNAP, and other critical safety net programs.”

“Today, as an adult, I am still working on the side effects,” said one former altar boy at a Wednesday hearing on past clergy misconduct in the state’s largest religious denomination.

Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerBURLINGTON — Two decades after news broke of a nationwide Catholic priest misconduct scandal, seven Vermont child sex abuse claimants spoke in court Wednesday about the lingering impact.“He molested me in my own house, in my own bed,” a 61-year-old man identified as Speaker 5 recalled of being an altar boy a half-century ago. “I froze and never said a word. Today, as an adult, I am still working on the side effects.”Leaders of Vermont’s Roman Catholic Diocese have heard many such comments over the years as they’ve paid out $34.5 million to settle 67 civil lawsuits alleging clerical improprieties dating as far back as 1950.But Wednesday saw officials in a different venue: U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Burlington, where the state’s largest religious denomination is seeking Chapter 11 protection in hopes of reorganizing its depleting finances.“I’d like to say thank you for having our voices heard,” the first speaker, who identified himself to reporters as Kevin McLaughlin, told Judge Heather Cooper. “This sort of thing leaves scars.”As part of the Chapter 11 process, all pending and future lawsuits have been placed on hold as 118 new accusers have submitted confidential claims to join the case as potential creditors — almost double the number of people who previously settled before the diocese filed for bankruptcy last fall.Although the bankruptcy court has no authority to rule on any of the sealed allegations, it allowed seven of the latest accusers to offer non-evidentiary “survivor statements” as a courtesy at a special session at Burlington’s Federal Building.“When the diocese filed for bankruptcy, it robbed those survivors of their opportunity to stand in front of a jury of their peers,” said Brittany Michael, the lawyer for a federally appointed committee representing creditors with abuse claims. “We know that the opportunity to speak in court can be an important part of the healing journey.”For two hours, speaker after speaker talked both generally and graphically, standing up and breaking down, as they remembered being anywhere from 6 to 15 when they were abused.“I immediately buried those memories, but I was forever changed,” said a man identified as Speaker 3. “I thought many times of committing suicide because it was so painful.”Other men spoke of continuing shame and stress, anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and panic attacks, as well as failed classes and marriages and alcohol and drug dependence.READ MORE
“It has taken me decades to understand this monster has been responsible,” a man identified as Speaker 2 said of the priest who abused him. “All this time I thought I had been the only one. My only regret is not having the courage to come forward sooner.”The Vermont diocese is the nation’s 40th Catholic entity to seek bankruptcy protection because of clergy misconduct. Under federal law, it must present the court with a tally of its financial assets and liabilities. The judge then will decide whether to allow church leaders to develop a reorganization plan that would require approval from both the court and creditors.Abuse claimants are seeking church records detailing not only a reported $35 million tied to the diocese’s headquarters and state-level holdings but also all the local operations it oversees, starting with 63 parishes with an estimated collective worth of $500 million. The resulting findings are expected to spark future court debate on which assets can be used to compensate creditors.Vermont Catholic Bishop John McDermott attended Wednesday’s special session.“It is my sincere hope and fervent prayer,” he said afterward in a statement, “that today’s hearing will be a source of continued healing for the survivors who shared their stories and for all who have filed a claim against the diocese.”McDermott was installed as bishop last July, only to land in court just two months later.“The diocese is not filing this bankruptcy case in an attempt to avoid any responsibility,” the bishop said at the time in an affidavit. “Due to the number of civil cases and claims filed against the diocese and limitations of the diocese’s resources, the diocese determined that reorganization under Chapter 11 is the only way to fairly and equitably fulfill the diocese’s obligations to all survivors of sexual abuse.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  A new wave of Vermont Catholic abuse claimants has its day in court.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VTD-Catholic-19-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-14 18:08:50.666591

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia Board of Education will pursue litigation over a recently-passed bill that gives lawmakers the ultimate authority over school board policies. 
The Republican-backed measure was designed to trigger litigation for a likely review by the state Supreme Court that will favor lawmakers’ side. 
The Legislature signed off on the bill earlier this year despite a clear voter rejection of a similar proposal three years ago. It became law last month without the governor’s signature.
“I move that the board pursue litigation to contest the constitutionality of House Bill 2755 regarding the board’s independent policy making authority,” said State School Board President Nancy White, who announced the legal challenge Wednesday at the board’s monthly meeting in Charleston. 
No other comments were made by board members about the litigation.
  Del. Mike Hornby, R-Berkeley
Bill sponsor Del. Mike Hornby, a Republican from Berkeley County, said he expected a legal challenge to the bill. He believes lawmakers have constitutional authority to intervene in education and noted the state’s near-bottom ranking in academic outcomes.
“I hope we will come out with the right decision here, and I look forward to the results,” he said. 
The bill requires that all legislative rules enacted by the state board must first be authorized by the Legislative Oversight Commission on Education Accountability, a lawmaker committee known as LOCEA. The proposed rules would then be submitted to the full Legislature for review.
“I think the point of the bill is to work with the Department of Education,” Hornby said. “A lot of people keep saying we want control — it’s not the intent.”
In 2022, West Virginia voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have given the Legislature authority to review and approve the state board of education’s rules and policies. 
Fifty-eight percent of voters were against it.
Opponents of this year’s legislation consistently argued that it was ignoring West Virginians’ decision on the matter and injecting politics into classrooms. 
Hornby also said he sponsored the bill because he wanted the West Virginia Supreme Court to revisit the issue. 
The state school board has independent authority to oversee schools. The state Supreme Court upheld this in 1988 in West Virginia Board of Education vs. Hechler, determining that the state Board of Education has the “general supervision” of schools under the Constitution. Any statutory provision that interferes with authority and rule-making is unconstitutional, the opinion read. 
“A lot of people think that decision was wrong,” Hornby said. “That’s why I figured we’d do this, and that’s why we got a lot of sponsors.” 
Ten other House Republicans sponsored the measure, including House Education Committee Chairman Joe Ellington, R-Mercer.
During bill debate, Democratic lawmakers predicted that the bill would likely result in a lawsuit. They argued — like the state school board — that the measure wasn’t constitutional since the state Supreme Court had already ruled on the matter and the proposed amendment was defeated by voters three years ago. 
Hornby said money spent on the case would be “well spent” if it fixes the education system.

“This is no ordinary criminal case, and Dugan is no ordinary criminal defendant,” the motion states. “Dugan is a Milwaukee County Circuit Court judge. She was arrested and indicted for actions allegedly taken in and in the immediate vicinity of her courtroom, involving a person appearing before her as a party. The government’s prosecution of Judge Dugan is virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional — it violates the Tenth Amendment and fundamental principles of federalism and comity reflected in that amendment and in the very structure of the United States Constitution.” 
The motion states that the problems with the prosecution “are legion,” and begin with her judicial immunity, which prevents judges from being charged with crimes for their official acts. Immunity is not a defense to be used at trial but “is an absolute bar to the prosecution at the outset,” the motion states, citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. United States that found the president can’t be charged with crimes for official acts. 
Dugan has been accused by federal officials of helping an immigrant without legal status in the U.S. escape from federal agents waiting to arrest him outside her courtroom last month. The criminal complaint alleges she directed the man, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who came to her court for a routine hearing in a misdemeanor case, out a side door to avoid federal agents waiting to arrest him with an administrative warrant. Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer exited the courtroom into the same hallway where the agents were waiting and a DEA agent rode down the elevator with him before he was arrested on the street. 
Trump administration officials have touted the case as an example of a stern federal response to “deranged” judges across the country working to stymie the president’s efforts to increase immigration enforcement. 
Dugan’s motion states the facts alleged in the indictment and criminal complaint against her would be disproven at trial, but that the case should never get that far. 
“Even if (contrary to what the trial evidence would show) Judge Dugan took the actions the complaint alleges, these plainly were judicial acts for which she has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution,” the motion states. “Judges are empowered to maintain control over their courtrooms specifically and the courthouse generally.” 
Dugan’s attorneys also argue that the prosecution violates the Tenth Amendment, which clarifies the balance of power between states and the federal government. The motion states that federal agents going into a state courthouse to arrest a sitting judge is a violation of the Constitution. 
“The government’s prosecution here reaches directly into a state courthouse, disrupting active proceedings, and interferes with the official duties of an elected judge,” the motion states. “The federal government violated Wisconsin’s sovereignty on April 18 when it disrupted Judge Dugan’s courtroom, and it is violating Wisconsin’s sovereignty now with this prosecution. The Court should end the violation of Wisconsin’s sovereignty and dismiss the indictment.” 
Dugan is scheduled to appear in court for her arraignment Thursday morning.

Gov. Gavin Newsom is supporting changes to encourage more housing.,"In summary
The California environmental law known as CEQA can be used to block construction in developed areas. Gov. Gavin Newsom is supporting changes to encourage more housing.


The effort by two Bay Area lawmakers to exempt most urban housing developments from the state’s premier environmental regulation — an idea that has drawn some of the state’s most powerful interest groups into a fierce legislative debate — just received a prized endorsement from Gov. Gavin Newsom.
While announcing his updated budget proposal for the coming fiscal year, the governor urged the Legislature to pass two housing bills and thanked their Democratic authors, Oakland Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener.
“It’s time to get serious about this issue, period, full stop,” Newsom said this morning. “If you care about your kids you care about getting this done. This is the biggest opportunity to do something big and bold and the only impediment is us.”
Wicks’ Assembly Bill 609 would exempt most “infill” housing developments,  projects built in or next to existing developments, from review under the California Environmental Quality Act. That 55-year-old statute requires governments to study the environmental impact of any decisions they make, including the approval of new housing. Any person or organization — construction worker unions, environmental advocates or neighborhood groups, to name a few —can challenge the validity of those studies, delaying approval. 
Critics of the law argue that it is regularly abused for non-environmental reasons to delay urban housing projects which are inherently better for the environment than sprawl development. Defenders of the law say such lawsuits are relatively rare.
Wiener’s Senate Bill 607 is a highly technical grab bag. Among other things it would make it easier for state and local governments to approve projects — housing and otherwise — without conducting a full, lengthy review and exempt certain zoning changes for infill projects from CEQA entirely.
Newsom said that he would include language that mirrors those policy goals in upcoming budget bills. 
“These bills are critical permitting reform proposals, and I applaud Gov. Newsom for including them in his proposed budget,” Wiener said in a statement. “By clearing away outdated procedural hurdles, we can address California’s outrageous cost of living, grow California’s economy, and help the government solve the most pressing problems facing our state.”
The governor also published proposed legislative language that would channel certain environmental impact fees collected from development projects toward the construction of new affordable housing located near public transit stops. That mirrors another bill authored by Wicks.
That proposed legislation would also give the California Coastal Commission, a frequent target of pro-development legislation, a deadline for responding to project proposals.
This isn’t the first time the governor has weighed in on the landmark environmental law. Two times in as many years, the administration has urged the Legislature to tinker with the law to make it easier to build infrastructure projects and to expand the state’s renewable energy capacity.

The Legislature hasn’t always listened and the prospect of comprehensive “CEQA reform,” a goal regularly touted by California governors and resisted by environmental groups and many unions, remains elusive. 
Those earlier legislative efforts were “weak sauce” and “piddlywinks,” these bills represent much more substantive change to housing and environmental policy, said Chris Elmendorf, a UC Davis Law professor and frequent public critic of CEQA.
“The fact that the governor is willing not just speak in generalities, not just have Ezra Klein on his podcast, but to endorse specific bills and even go beyond endorsing them by tying them to his budget and putting pressure on the Legislature, that, I think is a very big development that we haven’t seen previously from this governor,” he said.
His nod to these two bills comes at a politically important time. Wicks’ bill has sailed through the Assembly so far with the explicit backing of Speaker Robert Rivas. Wiener’s bill has made its way through one committee, but only barely and over the objections of that committee’s chair.Both Legislative leaders have vowed to prioritize legislation that promotes “affordability.” Rivas, closely allied with the “yes in my backyard” movement, has publicly endorsed a suite of bills aimed at reducing regulations and speeding up approvals for new housing. McGuire, tasked with wrangling a Senate Democratic caucus with public fractures over housing policy, has been more reluctant to articulate the specifics of his housing agenda.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/080723_Oakland-Affordable-Housing_SN_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 18:08:50.666591

The General Services Administration put the site on the market after July 2023 flooding caused significant damage.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  The former Montpelier post office building is up for sale. Should the city buy it?.","The federal building in Montpelier on Jan. 8, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerFor roughly 22 months, the former site of the Montpelier Post Office has sat vacant, a lonely looming presence at the corner of State and Elm streets. The building sustained significant damage from the July 2023 flood, when water inundated the streets of Vermont’s capital. It was so hastily vacated that federal employees’ items are still sitting on their desks, creating an “eerie” feeling, according to Jon Copans, executive director of the Montpelier Commission for Recovery and Resilience. Now, the city and state are considering whether it may be worth buying the property at 87 State St. from its owner, the U.S. General Services Administration. “If you think about the location of this particular building and piece of land, it really does represent a transformative opportunity for our city in terms of what comes next,” Copans said. The commission, a private/public partnership between Montpelier Foundation, Montpelier Alive and the city itself that was developed in the wake of the July 2023 flood, has been working to lead a discussion about the potential uses of the property — including housing, parking, businesses, state offices and more. The General Services Administration announced it would begin the disposition process in December 2024. On April 21, it sent a letter to Montpelier and the state of Vermont about the possibility of a negotiated sale, similar to a “right of first refusal” for government actors before it becomes available to the general public, Copans said. READ MORE
Since then, the commission has been coordinating a collaborative discussion between Montpelier, the General Services Administration and the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development to determine whether this property could be a good fit for Montpelier’s needs. Many questions remain. Copans wouldn’t even put a ballpark estimate on the sale price of the property since there hasn’t been an appraisal on it post-flooding. In the 2024 Grand List, it was valued at $7.8 million.Asked about the current condition of the building, Paul Hughes, a spokesperson for the General Services Administration, said via email that it has been “stabilized.” He wrote that the General Services Administration decided to dispose of the property “after it was deemed a high financial and operational risk.” Montpelier’s post office has since moved into the Montpelier City Center at the corner of State and Main streets. Copans said there was a “gargantuan” amount of water in the basement of the former post office, but “my understanding is they have done a lot of work.” Local rumors have circulated about problems with the building’s foundation, but Copans said the General Services Administration has reassured the commission that it’s still solid.It’s also unclear if the building may come with a historic covenant to preserve its appearance since it’s a part of Montpelier’s historic downtown. Copans said many people find its Brutalist style not “particularly pleasing,” but nonetheless, its historic status is one issue that would need to be addressed in order for Montpelier to get a sense of the value of the building.The 70,000-square-foot building, built in 1964, hosted the post office’s retail space on the first floor with room for postal activity in the back. The second and third floors had office space for federal agencies like the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. senators’ local headquarters. When it comes to how the city could make use of the building, Copans said housing was at the forefront of everyone’s mind. Montpelier has faced a housing shortage that only worsened after the 2023 flood. The property also comes with a large parking lot that could be developed into multilevel parking, Copans said. That could ease the need for parking on the other side of State Street, where riverside parking lots are exacerbating flood risk.“We don’t believe that’s the highest and best use for that riverfront property,” he said. “A, it is ugly and B, it’s really not great when it comes to flood resilience to have a bunch of impervious surface right next to the river.”Lindsay Kurrle, secretary of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, said the state has a “shared interest” in building resilient communities and developing housing for workers across the state. “This has presented an opportunity for everyone to kind of lean in and take a look at this building and see how it could be redeveloped,” Kurrle said. The state has no obligation to actually take ownership, Kurrle said — but it’s facilitating the opportunity to do an assessment of the sale. There’s no risk involved at this point, she said, since the parties are just expressing interest. The Montpelier city manager’s office, the city spokesperson and the mayor did not respond to interview requests. Read the story on VTDigger here:  The former Montpelier post office building is up for sale.

Jay Collins speaking in Tampa on May 12, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Hillsborough County Republican state Sen. Jay Collins is one of Ron DeSantis’ top allies in the Legislature’s upper chamber, so might the governor consider naming him as the state’s next lieutenant governor?
DeSantis hasn’t tipped his hand in any direction to date in terms of who he is considering to fill not only the LG position that has been vacant since Jeanette Nuñez departed to lead Florida International University in February, but also the chief financial officer seat that has remained empty since Jimmy Patronis resigned shortly before he was elected to serve as the U.S. representative in Florida’s 6th Congressional District last month.
POLITICO reported in late April that DeSantis is likely to select Hernando County Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia to succeed Patronis as CFO, although the timing remains uncertain with the Legislature now extending its regular session to contend with the serious disagreement between the two chambers about the state budget.
There hasn’t been much speculation about the lieutenant governor’s position, but Collins, like Ingoglia, is considered one of the governor’s closest supporters in the Senate.
“We haven’t had a direct conversation on that,” Collins told the Phoenix on Wednesday. “If my name’s in the running, that’s an incredible honor.”
Collins said that if the governor wants him in that role, “I’m sure we’ll have the appropriate conversation when the time comes. I think we’ve heard him say he’s really hyper focused right now on this budget, which is critical.”
He equally is focused on the House and Senate coming together to resolve their differences, Collins said.
“I’m really focused on getting the job done, but if that conversation happens, we’ll have it. It’s an honor to serve our state and I’d be happy to do it,” he said.
‘Perform such duties’
Per Article IV, Section 2 of the Florida Constitution, the lieutenant governor “shall perform such duties pertaining to the office of governor as shall be assigned by the governor.” Other parts of the state Constitution say that, upon impeachment “or during the governor’s physical or mental incapacity, the lieutenant governor shall act as governor.”
No other specific duties are assigned to the lieutenant governor, but most have been given specific assignments during their tenure. Nuñez was appointed by DeSantis as chair of the Florida Women’s Suffrage Centennial Commission at the beginning of their first term together in 2019, and in 2019 and again in 2023 to chair the Space Florida Board of Directors.
Collins has served in the Florida Senate since 2022. A decorated Army Special Forces veteran and Purple Heart recipient who served more than two decades in the U.S. Army, he initially decided to run for Congress against Democrat Kathy Castor in 2021. After redistricting occurred in early 2022, he then filed to run in Florida’s 15th Congressional District.
However, he was recruited by Florida Republicans to challenge Democratic incumbent Janet Cruz in the Florida Senate District 14 seat in Hillsborough County in the fall of 2022, with the full backing of DeSantis. He ended up winning the seat by 10 points.
DeSantis said in Tampa on Monday that he was intent on appointing replacements for lieutenant governor and chief financial officer once the regular legislative session ends — which, of course, hasn’t happened yet.
“Now, it doesn’t mean at this juncture that I couldn’t do anything before a budget gets laid on the desk, but I also just am mindful that there’s still work to be done, and I just want to make sure that we kind of see that process through. But we will do it, and that will happen, you know, relatively soon,” the governor said.

,California,2025-05-14 21:23:36+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom blames California’s worsening state budget outlook on Trump’s tariffs,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/california-budget-may-revise-trump/,"Gavin Newsom pinned California's gloomy financial picture on a ""Trump slump,"" blaming the president's tariffs during the rollout of a revised state budget proposal.","As Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a revised 2025-26 budget Wednesday, he blamed a “Trump slump” from President Donald Trump’s tariffs and other economic moves as the major factor in increasing the state’s deficit by another $12 billion.
“California is under assault,” Newsom told reporters at a budget briefing, declaring that Trump’s actions had created “a climate of deep uncertainty.”
The initial budget Newsom proposed in January already had at least an $11 billion gap between income and outgo that he filled with reserves, loans, deferrals, raids on special funds and accounting maneuvers.
State tax receipts were running ahead of expectations during the early part of the year, but after Trump imposed tariffs on imported goods, saying it would spur domestic production, Newsom and his budget staff revised revenue estimates downward, particularly personal income taxes.
“Washington’s imposition of tariffs has driven a downgrade in both the economic and revenue forecasts,” the revised budget declares. “Combined with increased expenditure growth above the governor’s (January) budget — most notably in Medi-Cal — the state must now close an estimated shortfall of $12 billion to balance the budget and provide for a prudent discretionary reserve. This will require difficult but necessary decisions to reduce ongoing expenditure growth to maintain budget resilience and stability for critical state programs.”
The revised budget maintains overall spending at virtually the same level of the January version, $322 billion, but drops general fund expenditures by $2 billion to $226 billion.
As noted, the state also experienced a multibillion-dollar spike in costs for Medi-Cal, the state’s health care system for the poor, which contributed to the $12 billion deficit estimate. Newsom proposed a series of maneuvers to close the new deficit, primarily reductions in Medi-Cal, including a freeze on adult enrollments and $100 per month premiums for Medi-Cal enrollees.
By singling out Medi-Cal as a major driver of state spending and urging reductions, Newsom was doing a 180-degree political pirouette from a year ago, when he was boasting about achieving nearly 100% medical care coverage for Californians with the addition of thousands of undocumented immigrants to the programs rolls.
The latest expansion of California’s chronic budget gap, what fiscal experts deem a “structural deficit,” makes it virtually certain that Newsom’s governorship will end 19 months hence with the state’s finances still unbalanced. The governor’s own budget staff and the Legislature’s nonpartisan budget advisor, Gabe Petek, have both projected multibillion-dollar deficits well into the future. It doesn’t appear that a sudden economic boom will provide fiscal salvation.
The revised budget projects that California’s economy faces a sluggish future, with little overall job growth and unemployment rates, which are now among the nation’s highest, virtually unchanged. Accordingly, state revenues are projected to increase slowly.
The forecasts don’t assume that the national economy will drift into recession, as some economists are predicting due to Trump’s tariffs. If one occurred, it would depress revenues even more.
The budget also does not assess the potential reductions in federal aid to states, particularly in health care, that Trump and Republicans in Congress have proposed. Medi-Cal and other social and medical programs are targets in both Washington and Sacramento because they are among the largest items in both federal and state budgets.
As services are trimmed to close budget gaps, advocates for the poor, public employee labor unions and progressive groups are increasing pressure for tax increases to balance the state’s books.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)The Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office announced Tuesday it seized hundreds of illegal gambling machines allegedly supplied to storefront casinos and other businesses by a pair of companies owned by a Pittsburgh man with prior convictions for illegal gambling.
The owner is also named in a 2024 grand jury presentment charging a former executive of skill game maker Pace-O-Matic with taking kickbacks for ignoring complaints to the company about illegal gambling machines.
The attorney general’s office said its agents and state troopers seized more than 400 illegal gambling devices from dozens of western Pennsylvania establishments in a series of raids in March.
J.J. Amusements and Buffalo Skill Games are each charged with a felony count of being a corrupt organization, according to court documents. No lawyers for the companies are named in the court filings.
”These devices were essentially slot machines dressed up as skill games,” Attorney General Dave Sunday said in a statement. “I commend our partners at the Pennsylvania State Police for helping disband a large-scale operation that netted a tremendous amount of illegal gambling profits.”
A search of the companies’ warehouse in Homestead, Allegheny County, uncovered $175,000 in cash and other signs of illegal gambling. The facility also had an elaborate surveillance system with dozens of monitors streaming live video and audio from the gambling locations, court documents say.
According to the charging documents, skill games are distinguishable from video gambling devices because they require players to use their judgment to win. The machines seized are similar to video slot machines, except that if only two symbols match, the machine prompts the player to “nudge” the third into place to recover their initial bet plus a small prize, the court documents say. 
While a spokesman for the attorney general’s office said it is pursuing charges only against Conley’s companies, court records show Conley was charged last year with illegal gambling offenses by the Cumberland County district attorney’s office. An attorney for Conley identified in a court filing did not immediately return a call Wednesday.
Federal court records show Conley was convicted of gambling and money laundering in 1995.
Conley and his son, John D. Conley, are also named in court documents as the leaders of an illegal gambling enterprise that paid nearly $100,000 in kickbacks to Ricky Goodling, a former state police corporal, who worked as national compliance director for Georgia-based Pace-O-Matic until 2023. A spokesperson for Pace-O-Matic said the company fired Goodling when it learned of the investigation.
Goodling is charged with racketeering and related offenses that stem from a years-long state police investigation. Also charged in the case are three employees of Deibler Brothers Novelty Co., a Schuylkill County company that prosecutors say distributed illegal gambling machines in 15 central and eastern Pennsylvania counties.
The attorney general’s office alleges Goodling took more than $500,000 in kickbacks from the Conley organization, Diebler Brothers and other operators to quash complaints about illegal slot machines. Prosecutors also allege Goodling helped distributors of the illegal devices obtain Pace-O-Matic’s machines to attempt to disguise illegal machines and deflect law enforcement scrutiny.
A preliminary hearing for Goodling in Schuylkill County is scheduled for May 22.
Pace-O-Matic is the predominant operator of skill games in Pennsylvania. 
A series of court decisions has established that skill games are distinct from gambling machines and not covered by the state Gaming Act. But Pace-O-Matic has been a proponent of legislation to regulate and tax the games to confirm their legal status. 
Gov. Josh Shapiro said regulating skill games is one of his goals in this year’s budget. His spending planestimates taxing the devices would generate around $370 million, recouping money the state lottery and casinos have lost.

Ivey Wednesday signed a bill sponsored by Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest that would regulate the sale of hemp products in Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Gov. Kay Ivey Wednesday signed a controversial bill aimed at regulating consumable hemp products into law.
HB 445, sponsored by Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest, faced strong opposition from the hemp industry, which claims the bill overregulates federally legal products, and the Alabama Policy Institute, a conservative think tank, which argued it did not regulate the products enough. 
Gina Maiola, a spokeswoman for Ivey, confirmed that the governor had signed the bill in a text message on Wednesday, but did not provide further comment.
Whitt said after the governor’s signature that it was “an easy bill” for him to sponsor but “a hard bill to pass.”
“It was hard because I took shots from both sides,” he said, saying that it was difficult to listen to the “stretches of truth,” such as claims from API that it would legalize recreational marijuana or from the industry that it’s a “complete ban.”
“It is putting guardrails on an unregulated and unlicensed product in the state of Alabama that’s preying on our youth,” Whitt said.

Messages seeking comment were left with API and Molly Cole, a lobbyist for the Alabama Hemp and Vape Association, who indicated that litigation was being considered.
The legislation will require testing and labeling for all consumable hemp products and caps at 10 milligrams per individually wrapped product and 40 milligrams per package. It will require the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board to license retailers of these products, restrict retail establishments selling hemp products and impose an excise tax on consumable hemp products.
The bill also prohibits sales to minors. It bans smokable hemp products and imposes restrictions on online sales and direct delivery. 
Whitt maintained that his efforts is aimed at reducing youth access to these products, saying that the industry has operated largely unchecked.

Representatives of the hemp industry said the bill’s language was vague and have suggested that litigation will follow. 
Lawmakers, business owners, patients and lobbyists have also expressed uncertainty about the legislation. Whitt said that the bill also bans hemp-derived vapor products, but that is not clearly defined in the bill.  
It’s not clear if the bill would ban CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in hemp. The bill explicitly bans smokable hemp products and certain psychoactive cannabinoids but defines “consumable hemp product” broadly as any finished product intended for human or animal consumption that contains any part of the hemp plant or its derivatives.
According to the bill, “any smokeable hemp product” not limited to “plant product or raw hemp material that is marketed to consumers as hemp cigarettes, hemp cigars, hemp joints, hemp buds, hemp flowers, hemp leaves, ground hemp flowers, or any variation of these terms to include any product that contains a cannabinoid, whether psychoactive or not.”
Whitt said that the legislation provides an opportunity for hemp business leaders to “pivot into the products that that are approved here in Alabama that can truly help Alabama citizens again.”

The report published by the Utah Foundation — a nonprofit with the mission of informing Utahns with nonpartisan public policy research — didn’t find glaring differences that would suggest Republican or Democratic delegates are completely out of touch with the rest of their voting party members. 
Axson or Lyman? Utah Republican delegates to elect their next leader

But it did find some notable differences, especially when it comes to demographics like age, sex and education, and issues that are top of mind when compared to the voters that delegates represent in the caucus and convention system. 
The Utah Foundation report, informed by three separate surveys conducted by Y2 Analytics in 2024, outlined these key findings: 

Pessimism: Delegates from both parties are more pessimistic than their voter counterparts. The difference was more apparent among Republicans, with 55% of GOP delegates saying they felt the state was on the wrong track compared to only 42% of voters. Among Democratic delegates, 84% said they felt the state was on the wrong track, compared to 79% of Democratic voters. 
Ideological differences: Republican delegates are “somewhat more conservative” than GOP voters, the report said, “while Democratic delegates are about the same as Democratic voters.” While measuring “ideological consistency” based on answers to survey questions, pollsters found the median Republican voter is “less conservative” than the median Republican delegate, while the median Democratic voter and delegate are about the same. “In other words, Utah’s Republican delegates are more likely to have consistently conservative views than Republican voters, while Democratic delegates are about the same as Democratic voters,” the report said. 
Issue priorities: GOP delegates “place less importance on housing, roads, air quality, and crime when compared to Republican voters,” the report said, “while Democratic delegates focus more on education content and less on healthcare and homelessness when compared to Democratic voters.” 
Demographics: Most notably, delegates of both parties are more likely to fit specific democratic characteristics. “Both Republican and Democratic delegates are more likely than voters to be men, actively religious, older, and white, and have more education and higher incomes,” the report said. 

Is the Utah convention system still relevant?

“I think the key takeaway is there are quite a few differences between voters and delegates,” said Utah Foundation President Shawn Teigen during a call with media discussing the outcomes of the report on Wednesday. “But I think the most notable is in terms of demographics. (Delegates tend to be) actively religious and men, but also tend to be older, white, and have more education and higher incomes.” 
When it comes to priorities, the survey also found some but not many differences between delegates and voters in both parties. 
When asked to rank 17 priorities, Republican delegates tended to rank the Great Salt Lake and women’s rights as more important when compared to GOP voters. However, Republican delegates also ranked housing, roads, density and crime as slightly less important, while air quality ranked less important. 
Democratic delegates, when compared to Democratic voters, ranked government overreach and crime as less important. 
In conclusion, the report said that even though delegates tend to be more pessimistic than their voter counterparts, in general “their ideological positions show notable alignment with voters.” 
“While voters and delegates have similar ideologies, the priorities look a little different for Republicans than they do for Democrats,” the report said. “The largest differences in priorities among the parties’ voters and delegates are air quality for Republicans and crime for Democrats, each of which was less important for delegates.”

,DC,2025-05-14 21:09:40+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"U.S. House panel passes GOP plan that cuts Medicaid by $625B, adds work requirement",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-panel-passes-gop-plan-cuts-medicaid-625b-adds-work-requirement,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House panel in charge of overhauling Medicaid by cutting hundreds of billions in federal spending wrapped up debate on its bill Wednesday, following a 25-hour session.The Energy and Commerce Committee voted 30-24 along party lines to sign off on the legislation, sending it to the Budget panel, which is expected to bundle it together with the other 10 measures Friday to create Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill.”The full House is set to vote on that package next week, though GOP leaders need to make sure nearly all of the chamber’s 220 Republicans support the overall bill in order for it to pass.The legislation, should it gain that backing, will then head to the Senate, where GOP lawmakers are expected to rewrite or eliminate numerous sections of the bill. Analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, shared with States Newsroom by Republican staff on the Energy and Commerce Committee, shows the Medicaid changes would cut $625 billion in federal spending during the next decade.About 10.3 million people would lose access to Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with 7.6 million people becoming uninsured during the 10-year budget window, according to the CBO analysis, which has yet to be released publicly.House committee debate on the bill, which began Tuesday and continued overnight, largely centered around Democrats saying the legislation would lead millions of vulnerable people to lose access to Medicaid, while Republicans contended their overhaul would protect “the integrity” of the health care program for lower income Americans and some people with disabilities.Democrats proposed dozens of amendments trying to change the bill’s various sections, including the Medicaid provisions, but Republicans on the committee blocked their adoption.‘They’re going to lose coverage’Just after the sun rose over Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning, Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman said Republican claims about people not being kicked off Medicaid due to federal spending cuts were going “off the rails.”“They're going to lose coverage in part because of the red tape and the paperwork. We know that because we've seen it in other states,” Landsman said. “And these are people who are eligible or deserving — people who need it.”Washington Democratic Sen. Kim Schrier later in the day raised concerns that people who lose access to Medicaid would put off getting routine care from primary care doctors, only to end up in emergency departments.""Those kicked off Medicaid will still get care, of course, but they will be sicker, they'll be treated in the emergency room, the care will be more complicated, more expensive,” Schrier said. “And since they can't pay for it, all of us will make up that difference. So our insurance rates will go up.""Florida Rep. Laurel Lee argued the GOP changes to Medicaid are common sense improvements, like “restoring work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, modernizing systems to prevent fraud and abuse, and ending misdirected payments to those who are deceased or who are not eligible for the program.”“These reforms are not about taking something away; they are about protecting the integrity of the program so that the people we represent — those who truly need this support — can count on it to be there, now and in the future,” Lee said. “Our reforms are about restoring integrity to the system and ensuring that it works for the long haul.”Attempts to ax work requirementDemocrats proposed numerous amendments during debate on the health care section of the bill, including some that would have eliminated the work requirements.New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, ranking member on the committee, said those requirements often cause people to lose access to Medicaid due to “red tape” and paperwork.Pallone said when Georgia implemented work requirements, fewer than 7,000 of the 400,000 people eligible for Medicaid were able to prove to the government they met the standards.“It's not that they weren't eligible, it's that the state of Georgia put too many barriers in the way of them being able to qualify,” Pallone said. “And that's what I think is happening here today with this bill.”He further criticized the GOP for including a provision in the bill saying that if people are not eligible for Medicaid then “they're not eligible for any kind of subsidy under the Affordable Care Act.”“So they don't have that option as well, which is, of course, also the basis for the CBO saying so many people get kicked off Medicaid,” Pallone said. “They assumed that if you didn't have Medicaid, you would go to the ACA, and that would have probably eliminated most of your savings. But instead, now you say they can't go to the ACA because they still haven't filled out the paperwork for Medicaid, so we're not going to let them go to the ACA and get any kind of subsidized care. And it goes on and on.”‘We don’t want to repeat the Arkansas law’Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., said the GOP proposals for work requirements sought to avoid the issues experienced in Arkansas and Georgia, when those states implemented their work requirements for Medicaid.“We don't want to repeat the Arkansas law,” Guthrie said. “We agree that was the wrong way to do it.”Arkansas’ experiment with work requirements and monthly checks was “overly cumbersome,” but Guthrie said this legislation would “only require a beneficiary to have to verify work at the time of enrollment or during a redetermined position of their eligibility. This allows states and beneficiaries to take advantage of existing processing and paperwork that they already go through.”The GOP bill includes several exceptions to the requirement that people enrolled in Medicaid between the ages of 19 and 65 work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month.Those exclusions include pregnant people, parents of dependent children, people who have complex medical conditions, tribal community members, people in the foster system, people who were in the foster system who are below the age of 26 and people released from incarceration in the last 90 days, among others.CBO estimates the work requirements would save the federal government $300 billion during the next decade. That savings wouldn’t begin until after the provision takes effect on Jan. 1, 2029.GOP lawmakers not on the committee have expressed frustration with the delayed implementation, including South Carolina Republican Rep. Ralph Norman.“Delaying work requirements for able-bodied adults on Medicaid to 2029 isn't ‘progress,’” Norman wrote in a social media post. “It's fiscally irresponsible and another sad excuse for the swamp!!”Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, wrote in a four-page letter, that Congress must “significantly amend” several of the bill’s Medicaid provisions, including immediately implementing the work requirements.“Republicans are in control now and should not let out-of-year savings be compromised by a future Democratic trifecta,” Roy wrote.Planned Parenthood debateTexas Democratic Rep. Lizzie Fletcher sought to remove the provision that would block Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood, though GOP lawmakers ultimately voted to keep the language in the measure. Federal law for decades has prevented taxpayer dollars from going to abortion services with exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient. But the provision in the GOP bill would block all Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, including for preventive care and regular health check-ups.Medicaid enrollees who go to Planned Parenthood for wellness checks, birth control, lab work, cancer screenings and other services would have to find a different provider, or go without care.“To make up the gap, federally qualified health centers would need to increase their capacity by an additional 1 million clients,” Fletcher said. “This is just another way people will lose access to health care. Defunding Planned Parenthood is an assault on the health, dignity and freedom of women across this country.”Fletcher later pointed out that Planned Parenthood clinics and their affiliates in states with abortion bans would be cut off from federal funding, even though they don’t provide abortions.She listed the Houston, Texas, Planned Parenthood as one example of a facility that doesn’t perform abortions but would lose federal funding.The Planned Parenthood language would increase federal deficits by about $300 million during the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It is the only provision in the health care section of the bill that would not reduce federal spending.Other organizations said to be affectedVirginia Republican Rep. Morgan Griffith said he was told by CBO that other health organizations in addition to Planned Parenthood would be impacted by the provision, but he was unable to name those health care organizations.The provision would apply to “providers that are nonprofit organizations, that are essential community providers that are primarily engaged in family planning services or reproductive services, provide for abortions other than for Hyde Amendment exceptions, and which received $1,000,000 or more (to either the provider or the provider’s affiliates) in payments from Medicaid payments in 2024,” according to a summary of the GOP bill. It would take effect as soon as the bill becomes law and last for a decade.Republican staff on the Energy and Commerce Committee did not immediately respond to a request from States Newsroom for the list that Griffith referenced.Legal staff said the secretary of Health and Human Services would determine what organizations meet that definition and would therefore lose federal Medicaid funding.Tennessee Republican Rep. Diana Harshbarger opposed the amendment, saying that it was well past time for Congress to cut off all federal funding for Planned Parenthood.“This bill does not change the availability of funds for women's health. It simply establishes a safeguard so that the nation's largest abortion providers are not the one providing services through Medicaid,” Harshbarger said. “Should these entities stop participating in abortion services, they would again be eligible to receive funding.”Republicans also blocked an amendment from Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly that would have required Medicaid to cover a full year of postpartum coverage for enrollees.The vast majority of states already cover postpartum care for a year under an expansion Democrats approved in the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill they enacted in 2021. That was later made permanent in a 2022 appropriations law.  But Kelly said she was worried that would change if states had to make tough budget choices due to a drop-off in federal funding for the program.“Medicaid covers almost half of all births in this country and covers more than half of all births in rural communities,” Kelly said. “When we talk about cutting funding, you are cutting into the care that supports moms and babies during the most vulnerable time of their lives.”Harshbarger spoke against the amendment, saying it was unnecessary.",,,,2025-05-14 18:08:50.666591

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In the 21st century our newly visible wealthy elite aristocracy, together with a few super-wealthy oligarchs leading the way, have essentially “come out” as a political class openly working to subvert American democratic values/processes and install themselves as America’s untouchable ruling class. The 2010 “Citizens United” court decision allows them to use their unlimited resources to purchase politicians willing to bend the knee to their every legislative wish, essentially turning the Congress into homeless beggars shining shoes and licking boots for a living.
American democratic culture has always understood that unregulated accumulation of capital makes for anti-democratic corruption of wealth holders. Not long ago, we imposed luxury taxes on everything from yachts to mansions to cars to airplanes to keep people from believing that they were special above all others. However, we no longer seem to care about the corrosive effects of huge piles of money because we repealed many of those taxes.
In Utah the wealthy class aligns with evangelical religious interests, which encompass certain Protestant, Catholic, and Latter-day Saint sub-groupings, as is the case nationwide. The idea is that the considerable private resources of the “kingdom of God,” together with regular encouragement to individual and familial self-sufficiency provided by church education systems, allows the public sector to clip its own wings by cutting back on state and local taxes.
The Utah legislature has cut the state income tax five times in recent years under the guise of promoting upward mobility for all Utahns. Their efforts constitute a reduction of the overall resources available for public uses in Utah without providing for regularized replacement sources of income.
In Utah, the Republican-controlled legislature recently attempted to allow a constitutionally mandated “earmark” of income tax funds for public schools, higher education, children and disabled people to be freed up for other purposes when needed. One might argue this amounts to a shift away from the priority that Utah’s ancestors established by instituting the “education earmark” in 1948 in the first place. After successfully concluding World War II, soldiers came home fully recognizing that they had fought for a more democratic world. They wanted to see progress in education for all of Utah’s citizens, not just the wealthy portion of the citizenry or a religiously partisan portion of it.
At a time when the national MAGA party is decimating long-standing federal education commitments, traditional Republican party theory says state governments are obligated to pick up the slack by means of federal block grants or at very least maintain local commitments. However, Utah is trying to deep-six the most important of those local commitments, further strangulating resources devoted to marginalized populations.
In October 2024, the court ruled that the legislature had failed to meet the informed notice requirements of a proper constitutional amendment, so the measure was voided for this year by the court.
The Sutherland Institute, Utah’s conservative think tank, ably summarizes the evangelical notion of private sector sufficiency by touting “the Utah Miracle.” This miracle is Utah’s heavy and purportedly successful dependence upon “economic growth, high religious attendance, and unmatched rates of married families.” However, this tripartite private focus is clearly not broad enough to “lift all boats,” or to provide for “trickle-down” resources from the rich to the poor, as evidenced by Utah’s exploding unhoused population.
Nationwide, unregulated capital has trashed the U.S. Constitution at every turn, including working to unhinge America from its progressive income tax structure and also rely on regressive sales and fuel taxes; end business competition by means of industry-wide monopolies in restraint of trade; diminish corporate taxation; lower tax rates on capital gains; prohibit government bargaining on drug prices; discriminate against lower-income renters by way of the home mortgage interest deduction provision of the tax code; double the exemption for estate taxes for the rich; push debt spending through misleading advertising so as to keep the middle class and the working poor in a perpetual state of debt servitude; engage in stock buybacks to line their own pockets.
For 3,000 years the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe and America kept interest rates charged on borrowers in the single-digit range, but now the American aristocracy has succeeded in charging 20% and more on credit card rates for the middle class, and anywhere from 100-300% on annualized short-term payday-type loans to the working poor. Utah recently had the second highest short-term consumer loan rates in the nation.
Since World War II the wealthy have also promoted the long-term decline of unions capable of collective bargaining. Utah wants to add to this negative trend by prohibiting public unions from collective bargaining. Utah voters are currently working on an initiative to reverse this legislative policy.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020625_Utah-State-Capitol_50-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 18:08:50.666591

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Lawmakers could wrap up the 2025 session as early as Wednesday – but there are still several spending and final policy measures left on the chambers’ calendars before legislators can head home.
Before ending the session, lawmakers must approve the state’s budget, the collection of bills funding Iowa’s state departments, agencies as well as meeting other spending obligations. Several of the appropriations bills for fiscal year 2026 passed Monday and Tuesday, some moving between chambers and others going to Gov. Kim Reynolds.
The spending bills sent to the governor reflect the budget agreement reached between the Senate and House Republican majorities earlier in May. Some of the budget items House Republicans had requested – like $14 million for paraeducator pay and $8 million for the public safety equipment fund – have been provided through a one-time allocation from the Sports Wagering Fund, which currently contains $40 million.
The Senate Appropriations Committee approved Senate Study Bill 1240 Wednesday, the bill making this appropriation, as well as Senate Study Bill 1241, the standings appropriations bill.
In addition to the budget bills being passed, there are several pieces of legislation on policy changes on the list for lawmakers to consider. Here is what the Iowa Legislature has passed so far Wednesday:
 Budget bills passed

Judicial branch: Senate File 648, the bill appropriating funding for Iowa’s courts, was sent to the governor by the House in a 86-1 vote. It allocates $221.83 for the state’s judicial branch and includes a 2.5% increase to judicial officer salaries, totalling $1.27 million.
Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, said he appreciated the raise for judicial pay included in the budget, though he supported further increases so Iowa can enlist and keep qualified judges in the state. He echoed comments made by Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, Tuesday, pointing to a recent situation where only two candidates applied for a judge opening in Iowa, as a reason why Iowa needs to increase pay.
“I think it’s critical in terms of recruitment, retention, retirement, that we stay competitive, that we have access to an adequate pool of talented justices, court officers, available,” Wilburn said.
Rep. Brian Lohse, R-Bondurant, the bill’s floor manager, said he spoke Thursday morning with former Iowa Rep. Dustin Hite, who was appointed as a district court judge in 2024, who said he believed he was “a better judge because he had been in private practice.” Increasing pay for judges will help the state recruit more lawyers in private practices to take judgeships, Lohse said, who can offer different expertise than county attorneys and lawyers in the public defender’s office or indigent defense – the people who typically take judge positions.
“We have to continue to fight to increase judge pay to a point where it is truly competitive, so that we can get the best applicants available – and from the positions and those areas of the law where we need really good, qualified, well-rounded judges,” Lohse said.
He also said the budget includes a change based on issues identified during the judicial branch’s review of a coding error that caused the misallocation of court debt funds. Lohse said it was discovered roughly $140,000 each year in fees paid by individuals for a court interpreter were being transferred to the jury and witness fee revolving fund instead of into the general fund as intended. The budget bill includes a policy change to continue transferring this money into the revolving fund, he said.
Justice system: Senate File 644, passed 60-27, provides $924.9 million for Iowa’s justice system, including funding for the state’s law enforcement entities including the departments of justice, corrections and public safety. Of that amount, $703.1 million comes from the general fund.
Lohse, who also managed the justice system spending bill, said the measure includes $1.07 million for indigent defense, raising the pay rate by roughly $2 per hour, in addition to transferring $1.95 million from the Indigent Defense Fund to the state Public Defender’s Office for the hiring of 13 new staff.
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, said though he supported the bill and Lohse’s efforts to provide funding for indigent defense, the state is still not meeting its legal or moral obligation to provide adequate funding for the lawyers representing people who cannot afford a lawyer.
“It’s pretty simple,” Thomson said. “It’s not that expensive. Yet we are paying so little as a state that we are not able to attract very many competent counsel to do the job while we’re making progress in raising that rate, it is still hopelessly too low. … At some point, sooner rather than later, we’re going to get sued and be compelled to pay adequate amounts.”
Lohse said he agreed with Thomson, saying House lawmakers will come back in 2026 to “continue to fight for indigent defense to do what we can, both in terms of dollars, but also in other legislation.”
The measure also includes $150,000 for the victims assistance grant fund through the Iowa Attorney General’s office to provide services for human trafficking victims, and has a transfer of $100,000 from the public defender’s office to the College Student Aid Commission, providing funding for the Rural Attorney Recruitment Assistance Program.
Rep. Megan Jones, R-Sioux Rapids, proposed but withdrew an amendment to limit the use of “geofencing,” the ability to obtain information from devices being used within geolocational boundaries, to monitor mobile phone use within the Iowa Capitol. The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation used “geofencing” software in the sports wagering probe that resulted in four Iowa State University athletes facing charges.
She said filings in a lawsuit on the sports wagering case contained information showing geofencing software had been used at the Capitol, a practice she said violated the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, protecting people from unreasonable searches and seizures from the government.
“The innocent, our constituents, Iowans, our visitors to this very building suffer at the very contemplation that their phones were being geofenced for whatever legal purpose and monitored while they were in this building,” Jones said. “How sad it is that these words have to even be spoken in this building. Iowans, you deserve to be safe in this building, in these hallowed walls. You deserve to be able to seek redress against your government without being feared of being spied on.”
The measure heads to the governor for final approval.
 Policy bills moved through

Unemployment insurance tax: Senate File 607, a bill making changes to Iowa’s unemployment insurance taxes, passed 32-16.
The legislation proposed by Reynolds would cut the taxable wage base used to calculate unemployment insurance taxes in half from 66.7% to 33.4%. It includes other changes, like reducing Iowa’s unemployment tax tables, and excludes wages paid from employers to employees working in other states from the definition of “taxable wages” if the other state extends reciprocity to Iowa.
The measure was amended by Sen. Adrian Dickey, R-Packwood, to remove a section of the bill collecting surcharges from employers of 10% of contributions made to unemployment insurance, if the employer’s average benefit ratio from the past three years was at or more than 1.25.
Democrats proposed multiple amendments, including measures to reverse Iowa’s cuts to unemployment benefits in recent years, each of which failed. Another amendment would have waived work search requirements for people who have seasonal employment.
Senators opposing the legislation and who tried to amend it said this legislation does not help workers but benefits the companies that lay them off. They said it causes residents to find work in another state rather than try to figure out a complicated, burdensome system that won’t provide aid for as long as they need. 
“Our unemployment system is rigged for the employers, particularly with this bill,” Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Marion, said. “It is the workers who hold those businesses up, and we need to do better by those workers, not give more breaks to the employers who are laying them off.” 
Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said he was “ashamed” of Senate Republicans for how they’re treating workers with the legislation by not allowing more time to take advantage of benefits and helping businesses more than employees. 
Providing unemployment insurance to Iowans doesn’t mean they’re just being handed a check, Dotzler said, it means they have the time to better themselves for employment while they seek it and won’t have to worry as much about finances in the process. 
Dickey called concerns brought up by Democrats “old, tired talking points,” and said the problems they worried about with previous unemployment legislation have not come to fruition. Iowa’s population grew between 2023-2024, he said, countering statements that Iowa is losing workers in favor of going to other states with better pay, benefits and unemployment programs. 
For the lawmakers who said the process to apply for unemployment is too complicated, harming those who need aid, Dickey said they’d be happy to know that Iowa Workforce Development will launch updated websites and materials this summer. 
Dickey acknowledged there are flaws in the current system, including the state’s unemployment fund, and said the Legislature should take time next year to take a hard look at how unemployment works in the state. However, Iowa is third in the nation for average weekly rate of benefits at just over nine weeks. He asked why Iowa would want to be like its neighbors, who have longer averages. 
“The Republican Party has been the party to stand up for Iowa workers,” Dickey said. “We are the party that wants our workers to aspire more than desiring an unemployment check.” 
The House was debating similar legislation Wednesday afternoon.
Expanded Medicaid work requirements: The Iowa House approved an amendment from the Senate on the bill setting work requirements for the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan (IHAWP), sending it to Reynolds for final approval.
Senate File 615 requires IHAWP recipients to work at least 80 hours per month in order to remain eligible for health coverage through the expanded Medicaid program that covers able-bodied adults from ages 19 to 64 with incomes 133% or below the federal poverty level. It includes exceptions for people with high-risk pregnancies, those with children under age 6 and those in substance abuse treatment programs for up to six months. 
The measure also includes “trigger” language that would end IHAWP if the federal government approves, then later rescinds, approval of work requirements.
The Senate amended the bill to remove a provision included in a House amendment to the bill directing Iowa HHS to study and return to lawmakers before the 2026 legislative session with a report on the Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities (MEPD) program.
The House approved this change. Rep. Carter Nordman, R-Adel, said he was still in support of the study, but said the language was not necessary as Iowa HHS director Kelly Garcia has made a “commitment” to study and discuss the program with lawmakers before the next session.
“I will also commit, while we will be taking this out of the bill, (to) working with Rep. Turek and Director Garcia in the interim to see to it that this still gets done,” Nordman said.
Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, said this provision was a step to ensure “work without worry” efforts – removing the Medicaid asset and income limits for people with disabilities – moves forward. A subcommittee meeting was held on a bill making these changes to Medicaid in 2025, but the measure did not advance.
He said he appreciated work Nordman has done on this issue, and said the issue was with the Senate.
“I think that we should send this back to them,” Turek said. “Let them choke on it.”
Turek and other Democrats also took issue with the bill as a whole. Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames, called the MEPD study “the only good piece in the bill.”
“The governor has already requested this waiver unilaterally,” Wessel-Kroeschell said. “So then the only thing left is to gamble with the lives of over 180,000 Iowans who would lose their health insurance. … That’s the gamble. Stop gambling with the lives of Iowans who make less than $17,000 a year.”
Reynolds and the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services have submitted a waiver request to the federal government to implement work requirements. The HHS proposal is slightly different from the legislative proposal, requiring Iowans on IHAWP work 100 hours per month or earn the equivalent to working 100 hours per month at $7.25 per hour. People can also retain coverage if they are enrolled in education or job skills programs.
The legislation was approved 56-30 and heads to Reynolds’ desk.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Supreme Court has indefinitely suspended Broward County Circuit Judge Gary Farmer, the justices announced Wednesday. 
Farmer, who served as Florida Senate Democratic leader for about four months in 2020 and 2021, was recommended to be suspended by Florida’s Judicial Qualifications Commission last month, which concluded he showed “unfitness to serve.” The Supreme Court agreed. 
Judicial oversight panel: Ex-lawmaker’s comments show ‘unfitness to serve’

The suspension is without pay and will be effective Monday. 
“The Court encourages the Commission to conduct any remaining proceedings promptly, in a manner consistent with the Commission’s rules and the procedural rights of the respondent,” Supreme Court documents state. 
The commission investigated comments Farmer made last year, from the bench and in court orders. Some he delivered as “dad jokes” while the commission categorized others as demeaning and potentially humiliating. 
“Through his extensive misconduct, occurring over a lengthy period of time, Judge Farmer has damaged the public’s perception of the judiciary and the judicial branch in such a way that he has demonstrated a present unfitness to serve,” the 13-page recommendation of suspension from April states.

Farmer’s response
Farmer’s response to the commission’s charges last week argued there were “no urgent grounds or genuine exigent circumstances that warrant or require suspension of respondent pending trial or other final outcome of these matters.”

During his service on the bench during the proceedings, “the rendition of justice will not be impaired or undermined,” Farmer’s attorneys wrote. 
“Indeed, Respondent has reflected on his comments and learned lessons. He has been striving to exhibit the highest level of professional conduct.”
The disciplinary process stems from an anonymous letter from prosecutors with the State Attorney’s Office in Broward County, according to court filings. 
Following the complaint, the investigation found, among other documented instances, that Farmer told a litigant expecting three children with different women: “You were just shooting all over the place! That’s good, do you know their names? First and last? Romantic are you? Don’t tell Susie about Jane don’t tell Jane about Mary God bless you man. One’s enough.”
Later, Farmer told the defendant he was going to put him on pretrial release but “I’m going to order that you wear a condom at all times. For your own good. Ok?! Probation is going to check. No, I’m kidding. I’m kidding.”
Other instances include Farmer “prejudging the outcomes of future cases, not yet before him,” relating to laws permitting deadly force in self-defense.
Some of his “dad jokes” were to lighten the mood in the courtroom, Farmer argued: “‘Spring is here, I got so excited I wet my plants’ and ‘What did the shirt say to the pair of pants? Wassup britches!’” and “I called the incontinence hotline. They told me to hold.”
“While some of the comments or jokes made by Respondent were distasteful, no one other than anonymous prosecutors has filed any complaint in any form against Respondent,” Farmer’s attorneys wrote. 
They added that the judge had been experiencing “a sense of depression for the first time in his life” and that “his only relief, and the best part of his day, was his time in court where he believed he was serving a public good and a noble cause.”
“He realizes that what he thought were innocent ‘dad jokes,’ designed to lighten the atmosphere and lessen the tension in the courtroom, were actually ‘bad jokes’ that could undermine confidence in the judicial system by anyone who appears in his courtroom.”

Dan McKee to the Rhode Island Commerce Corp. board of directors. (Courtesy photo)Gov. Dan McKee is betting on a top executive at Bally’s Corp. to help steer the state’s quasi-public economic development agency.
McKee announced his nomination Wednesday of Tracey Wiley, executive director of diversity, equity and inclusion at Bally’s, to the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation board of directors. If approved by the Rhode Island Senate, Wiley will replace board member Dave Chenevert, whose three-year term expired in February. State law allows appointed members of boards and commissions to continue serving beyond the expiration of their terms until a replacement is named.
“Tracey brings a track record of business acumen and experience that speaks for itself,” McKee said in a statement. “Her background as an entrepreneur and champion of small businesses offers a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the Commerce Corporation Board. I look forward to working with her to make our state a more prosperous place for residents, workers, and our economy.”
As part of the 12-member Commerce board of directors, Wiley will help decide how the agency awards its tax credits and economic incentives for small and large businesses, along with marketing initiatives and a student loan repayment program for graduates who work in in-demand fields. McKee also serves as an ex-officio member of the board, only voting to break a tie. For example, in 2022, McKee cast the tie-breaking vote to redirect state tax dollars to help pay for the development of the Centreville Bank Stadium in Pawtucket. 
Wiley in a statement addressed the importance of entrepreneurship and “diversity of thought.”
“Both our small and large businesses, drawn from all corners of our communities, stand as a testament to this, acting together as the driving force behind economic strength and continued growth,” Wiley said. “I am deeply honored by this appointment from Governor McKee to the Commerce Board and am committed to championing the spirit of inclusivity and collaboration, as we forge a future of shared prosperity.”
Wiley joined Bally’s as a consultant in 2021 and the following year assumed a permanent role leading DEI for the company’s 19 casinos and resorts, including in Tiverton and Lincoln, according to her resume obtained by Rhode Island Current. Prior to that, Wiley worked for six years for the state of Virginia, heading its newly created Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity. Under her direction, the state agency grew its share of contracts awarded to women and minority-owned businesses, and oversaw the distribution of $100 million in federal pandemic grants to 3,000 small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Wiley also started her own company, Rainmaker Industries Group LLC, in 2021, which she continues to lead today as “chief experience officer,” according to her LinkedIn page. Her resume describes the LLC as a consultancy of “a collection of her work to leverage relationships for the sole purpose of elevating communities of color and creating access to models that build generational wealth for a diverse people.”
A community activist and 25-year survivor of multiple sclerosis, Wiley serves as chairwoman of the board of trustees for the Virginia and West Virginia chapters of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. She also serves on the board for professional NBA and WNBA teams, the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury, and formerly headed the board of directors for Boston-based former nonprofit Interise, which helps disadvantaged and low-income businesses.
She earned a bachelor’s degree in speech communications from Old Dominion University.
Wiley was also nominated by McKee on April 11 to join the Governor’s Workforce Board. The Rhode Island Senate voted to confirm that appointment on May 8.
The Senate has not yet scheduled a vote on Wiley’s nomination to Commerce, Greg Pare, a Senate spokesperson said Wednesday.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-14 21:00:34+00:00,CT Mirror,Proposed SNAP rules could lead to CT cuts benefits or eligibility,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/14/proposed-snap-rules-could-mean-ct-cuts-benefits-or-eligibility/,"A new federal cost-sharing plan, plus new rules, are raising concerns about trimming SNAP benefits or eligibility in states like Connecticut.","Federal lawmakers are considering a proposal from Republicans that would for the first time require states to pay for a portion of nutrition benefits for low-income individuals and families. That cost-sharing plan, plus new work requirements, are raising concerns about whether states like Connecticut would need to cut benefits or change eligibility.
The House measure, which is looking for significant cost savings to help pay for the GOP’s larger tax package, would significantly restructure how the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, is funded.
Since its inception, the federal government fully covers benefits provided to SNAP recipients and shares the administrative costs of running the program equally with each state. Under the new proposal, Congress would institute a cost-sharing program with states and increase state contributions for administrative expenses to 75%.
The new expectations that states may need to start covering benefits in 2028 could place a new burden on Connecticut’s finances and state budget. State officials don’t yet know how exactly that might affect the administration of the program but anticipate that a “redesign” is inevitable if the state cannot cover the costs.
“I don’t think any state is prepared to take on that level of benefit. I don’t want to speak for the governor or the legislature, so I don’t know what priorities they will set and what decisions they will make based on what happens, what budget allocations would be made,” Connecticut Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said in an interview with The Connecticut Mirror.
“But there isn’t a state in the country that has ever had to engage cost sharing with respect to benefits, and our administrative costs have always been shared equally,” she added. “That is something that we always thought was a fair trade around that.”
More than 40 million Americans received food stamps last year. And in Connecticut that same year, nearly 400,000 people, or 1 in 9 state residents, got those benefits, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half of the recipients in the state are in families with children.
In 2024, Connecticut received a total of $885 million in SNAP benefits. Barton Reeves said the total number seems high but noted many recipients receive very small amounts — some seniors only get $60 a month.
If the changes in the federal bill become law, Connecticut would be on the hook for a percentage of that expense each year. That could mean tapping into other funding to cover SNAP or restructuring who qualifies and for how long — hypotheticals the state is not currently entertaining and may need to figure out down the road.
“There’s only certain ways that you can find to cover that gap and that is you try to find another revenue stream somehow. You make a decision with some other program where you would take those resources from. I can’t think of any other place that we would decide is less important or should receive fewer resources in order to move money over,” Barton Reeves said.
“It does fundamentally mean for this and every other state, you’d have to look at how the program is designed, and it may mean that you’d have to look at eligibility standards and duration of benefits, all of the things you look at, which are really just unthinkable quite frankly,” she added.
This week, several House committees have been considering components of the GOP’s major tax package that they are hoping to fully pass in the summer. They are going through the budget reconciliation process to avoid needing 60 votes in the Senate and instead pass a bill on a party-line vote without needing Democrats’ support.
For the past two days, members of the House Agriculture Committee have focused on their part of the plan, which would cut $230 billion to help pay for the overall bill. Those savings would largely come from reforms to SNAP, like stronger work requirements and cost sharing with states.
Under the House GOP proposal, the states would pay a percentage of at least 5% up to 25% based on the error payment rate of the program. Based on 2023 error rate data, the committee estimates Connecticut’s cost-share would be 20%. But that number could change since it would be calculated off of future data from fiscal year 2026.
Barton Reeves said she has larger concerns over the “tolerance threshold” when it comes to SNAP overpayments and underpayments and how that factors into calculating a state’s error rate. The $56 a month threshold would go down to $0, meaning states will have to be near perfect. 
Under the proposed rules, states could face penalties for single-dollar payment errors. She noted that Connecticut has a compliance rate of about 97% when it comes to processing SNAP benefits.
The GOP plan would also impose stronger work requirements for certain able-bodied adults without dependents. For older adults, it would raise the age limit from 54 to 64. The same would also apply to adults with children age 7 or older. They would be required to work or participate in related training for at least 80 hours a month.
Lawmakers on the Agriculture Committee debated a change that would adjust how a dependent is defined since current law exempts able-bodied adults from the work requirement if someone under age 18 lives in their household. Republicans argued children over 7 are school-aged and that will free up parents or caregivers to meet the 20 hours of work a week threshold. Democrats pushed back that kids don’t go to school seven days a week and noted the challenges for families when they are on summer break.
Republicans were looking to avoid directly cutting SNAP benefits in their legislation when looking at ways they could find savings. They argue their plan goes after waste, fraud and abuse in SNAP and will make it function based on its original intent.
“The reforms in the committee markup ensure that SNAP works the way Congress intended it to, and by reinforcing work and instituting long overdue accountability incentives to control cost and end executive and state overreach. This will preserve the integrity and fiscal sustainability of the program moving forward so it can continue to serve the most vulnerable among us,” House Agriculture Committee Chairman GT Thompson, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said at Wednesday’s hearing.
But officials in both red and blue states have warned that the cost-sharing proposal would lead to cuts in order to take on the new costs of the program.
While changes to eligibility or cuts to benefits would have the most direct impact on recipients and families, critics of the plan also raised concerns of what it could mean for farmers and the small food retailers that rely on revenue coming through SNAP.
Speaking from the Whitneyville Food Center in Hamden Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, and other stakeholders talked about the effect on all those parties that benefit in some way from SNAP. They noted that the program accounts for about a third of all sales for independent grocers.
“So cutting SNAP benefits now would not only worsen food insecurity, it would also undercut the small food retailers who rely on those dollars to stay in business,” said Tatiana Andreyeva, director of economic initiatives at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health.
When talking about eligibility, Meg Hadley Zimmerman, program manager for End Hunger Connecticut!, noted that many students in the state qualify for free and reduced lunches in schools because their family participates in SNAP. She also noted for every dollar spent in SNAP, it generates $1.50 in economic activity in Connecticut.
Back on Capitol Hill, much of Tuesday and Wednesday’s markup of the bill was dominated by discussion over the proposed changes to the nutrition program and the financial burden it could place on states.
“No state has that amount of a budget surplus to backfill all of these programs that are being cut. The thing that we should be able to agree upon is feeding people, hunger is a policy choice once again,” U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, said at Tuesday’s hearing. She is the ranking member of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, Foreign Agriculture, and Horticulture, and offered amendments to the bill.
“As someone from a donor state that gives more to the federal government than we get back, I know there are many red states that already receive more from the federal government,” Hayes said. “What happens if a state can’t come up with their portion? It means that people in your respective states will lose benefits.”
Hayes offered amendments during the markup, including one to ensure any changes to the program don’t result in cuts. But Republicans hold a majority on the committee and have the numbers to block any amendments and ultimately advance the bill. She argued that states will now be responsible for additional funding including for health care and child care.
“So governors have to worry about food programs, they have to worry about health care, they have to worry about Head Start programs being cut,” Hayes said. “It’s not just one program. It’s not just what we’re considering on this committee.”
The House’s proposal is subject to change, especially once the Senate takes up the tax package. Republicans are hoping to wrap up the entire process, known as budget reconciliation, by the July 4 holiday and get it to President Donald J. Trump’s desk.
Debate in Congress over reforms to government programs keeps coming back to a central question for all states: can they shoulder new costs to continue provide serves and benefits like Medicaid and SNAP at similar levels?
The various proposals under consideration shift more of that responsibility from the federal government to the states.
“It is a way politically for governors of red and blue states to be compelled to make really difficult, unimaginable decisions about how they will provide health care and food support and many other things to their own states given that they have very, very limited budgets in many ways,” Barton Reeves said. 
“It moves the onus away from the feds who are actually making these changes, to make the cuts, onto states, knowing that states don’t have the capacity to absorb all of those cuts,” she continued, “which means that every state now is going to have to make some really difficult decisions about what to do. And we’re no different here in Connecticut.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0303_SR_LamontMediaAvailability_056-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

Free.,Sweeping private school voucher program tucked inside U.S. House GOP tax bill,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/sweeping-private-school-voucher-program-tucked-inside-us-house-gop-tax-bill,,"WASHINGTON — A national school voucher program got a step closer to becoming law Wednesday, as school choice continues to take heat across the United States.The proposal in the U.S. House would allocate $5 billion a year in tax credits for people donating to organizations that provide private and religious school scholarships and is baked into the Ways and Means Committee’s piece of a massive reconciliation package to fund President Donald Trump’s priorities.The tax credit provision largely reflects the Educational Choice for Children Act — a sweeping bill that GOP Reps. Adrian Smith of Nebraska, Burgess Owens of Utah and Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana reintroduced in their respective chambers earlier this year.The tax-writing committee advanced its measure Wednesday in a party-line vote. Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move the package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship.“School choice” is an umbrella term centering on alternative programs to one’s assigned public school. While proponents have argued that school choice programs are necessary for parents dissatisfied with their local public schools, opponents say these efforts drain critical funds and resources from school districts.At a press conference Wednesday, Rep. Elise Stefanik praised the Educational Choice for Children Act, which she cosponsored in the House.The New York Republican said the bill is “a transformative piece of legislation that will expand educational opportunities for children across our nation.”“For too long, students, especially those from underserved communities, have been trapped in failing school systems,” she said, adding that “school choice gives students the opportunity to succeed” and “is the great equalizer.”$20 billion tax credit over 4 yearsThe tax panel’s proposal includes a $20 billion total tax credit, which would be made up of a $5 billion tax credit annually between 2026 and 2029. The scholarships would be available to students whose household incomes do not exceed 300 percent of the median gross income of their area.“This is opening the door to the federal government subsidizing a secondary private system of education that gets to pick and choose who it educates and how it educates kids,” Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy at AASA, The School Superintendents Association, told States Newsroom.The association helps to ensure every child has access to a high quality public education.“​​I think it’s really important for folks to understand that we are opening this door for the first time to this kind of subsidy,” Pudelski said.The provision also comes as Trump has made school choice a major part of his education agenda.He signed an executive order in January that gave the U.S. secretary of Education two months to offer guidance on how states can use “federal formula funds to support K-12 educational choice initiatives.”More oppositionOrganizations that advocate for students with disabilities, including the National Center for Learning Disabilities, the Council for Exceptional Children, the Center for Learner Equity, and The Arc of the United States, fiercely opposed the bill, highlighting concerns that it is not sufficient in providing enforceable protections for students with disabilities and their families.In a statement, Jacqueline Rodriguez, CEO of the National Center for Learning Disabilities, said “the guarantee of rights and protections for students with disabilities using these vouchers is disingenuous at best and crooked at worst, without the other critical provisions of IDEA,” or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.“It is quite possible that families with disabilities will use a voucher under the pretense that their child will have the same rights when in fact they do not,” Rodriguez said.",,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderDozens of Kennesaw State University students and others gathered outside University System of Georgia offices in Atlanta Wednesday to ask the Board of Regents not to eliminate majors in Black studies, philosophy and technical communication.
The university announced last month that it plans to eliminate the three majors, citing low enrollment numbers.
Kennesaw State University spokeswoman Tammy DeMel said the programs did not meet the graduation standards required by all majors.
“Undergraduate programs are expected to maintain a three-year rolling average of at least 10 graduates per year. The Black Studies major has a three-year graduation average of 5.7 degrees per year, while Philosophy averages 6.3 and Technical Communications 7.7,” DeMel said.
“The programs underwent a multi-year remediation process, which included annual improvement plans focused on increasing enrollment,” she added. “As the required benchmarks were not met, the University deactivated these programs.”
DeMel said the school will ensure current students majoring in those subjects will have the opportunity to complete their degrees, and courses from those subjects will continue to be offered as minors or electives.

That wasn’t much comfort for students outside the offices Wednesday, some of whom disputed the university’s numbers. Students characterized the move as preemptively folding to pressure from the state and federal governments.
President Donald Trump’s administration has threatened to investigate and withhold federal funding from universities that promote “diversity, equity and inclusion.” Kennesaw State has been moving forward with plans to shut down resource centers for groups like LGBTQ students and students of color.
The Georgia Senate passed a bill this year that would have banned DEI programs and policies from all state public schools and universities, but the measure did not get a vote in the House.
Simran Mohanty, a third-year KSU student majoring in sociology on the pre-law track, said philosophy classes have prepared her to study law.
“Philosophy helps a lot with critical and analytical thinking,” she said. “You typically have a lot of readings to do, so you have to be able to critically analyze the readings, which is really good for pre-law students who need to read legal briefs or long case documents such as that, and it also helps to have analytical thinking of being able to analyze those readings and apply it to real-world context, practical context. So philosophy has been monumental in my studies.”
KSU student Jacob Waller, who is seeking a double major in philosophy and psychology, said he fears doing away with the majors would prevent students who want to dip their toes in the field from doing so.

“You’re cutting institutional support to the major so that all of the rigor and the quality of the classes as it is currently – which is very incredible due to our four professors, we only have four people in the department but they’re all incredible and work very hard to make sure that the sanctity of the space is preserved – the quality of those classes is going to diminish significantly by getting rid of the major because you’re cutting most of the systemic support for it.”
Stephan Sellers, a third-year mechatronics major who has taken philosophy and Black studies courses, said they have been some of the most important of his college career.
“Those courses teach us not only who we are, but the history of our diaspora from the African continent,” he said. “And those studies also teach us that we have a voice, we have power, and so with these studies being taken away, I can see that some of the students coming in will miss out on very vital parts of their education.”
The Georgia Board of Regents is set to meet Thursday, but a vote on the majors is not scheduled on the agenda.

(U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service/Flickr)An update to Arkansas’ surface-water quality rules was pulled from the Legislature’s Joint Public Health Committee’s agenda Wednesday to give lawmakers more time to consider it.
Meanwhile,  a Department of Human Services rule, which would change state Medicaid rules to allow recipients up to two urgent care visits a year without a doctor’s referral, was sent to a subcommittee for further consideration after multiple legislators expressed concern about whether the text of the rule could have unintended consequences.
The changes to Rule 2, which contains the water quality standards for rivers, lakes and other surface waters in the state, were brought before the committee by the Department of Energy and Environment’s Division of Environmental Quality. 
States such as Arkansas that have been authorized to administer the federal Clean Water Act are required to undergo this review every three years to update existing water quality standards.
Committee chair Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, said Rule 2 would likely receive its own hearing in June or July, separate from the committee’s other business.
The regulation containing Arkansas’ existing water quality standards was already long, and the current review introduced a number of changes. DEQ is making cadmium and ammonia standards — which are from 1986 and 1999, respectively — more stringent to match the standards set by the EPA in 2016 and 2013 for those pollutants. Additionally, DEQ included standards for five new pollutants not currently in the regulation. 
These pollutants — benzene, ethylbenzene, phenol, toluene and xylene — can have a wide variety of detrimental effects on human health. The standards are “health-based,” the division said in its documentation, and are meant to protect the health of humans and wildlife exposed to the state’s surface waters.
“I think [committee members] needed more time to review it,” Irvin said after the meeting concluded. “There were a lot of public comments, as well as comments from other state agencies and constitutional offices — so a lot of questions.”
The Arkansas Department of Transportation and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission submitted feedback during the public comment period earlier this year. While ARDOT questioned when the new standards would become applicable to permit holders and how the change from a fecal coliform bacteria standard to an e. coli standard would affect permits, AGFC continued its requests to designate more waters in the state as “Extraordinary Resource Waters” in order to protect vulnerable and endangered species. 
The agency made a similar request in 2020, during the last triennial review.
  Medicaid and Urgent Care 

A proposed amendment to a DHS rule aiming to hasten access to urgent care clinics for Medicaid recipients was referred to the Human Services subcommittee.
Representatives from the department said the goal of the change was to divert patients from emergency rooms when there were other treatment options available. The need for a referral was a barrier to this when medical care became necessary after hours and a referral could not be obtained.
The rule would allow Medicaid recipients with a primary care provider to go to an urgent care clinic twice a year without a referral, while those “who are not yet assigned” a PCP would be allowed to go up to four times. Referrals would be required after the number of yearly visits are exhausted.
Some lawmakers instantly took issue with the rule’s language. Rep. Aaron Pilkington, R-Knoxville, said he was opposed to the change due to concerns it would remove incentives for Medicaid recipients to obtain a primary care provider.
“It seems like this flies in the face of what the Legislature has been doing the last decade, trying to get more people to have an assigned PCP who is someone who can actually be the quarterback of their care,” Pilkington said. 
Research has found people with a PCP tend to have better health outcomes than those without one, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
“We want to preserve the bond between a patient and their PCP,” said Nell Smith, DHS’ deputy director of medical services. “That’s why we still require a PCP referral [after a certain number of visits]. We don’t want to shift care onto urgent care clinics.”
However, Smith said, when these patients need care outside of business hours, they’re being sent to the emergency room because of difficulties obtaining referrals.
“It’s a fine balance, I’ll give you that,” Smith said. 
Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, appeared to take issue with requiring referrals for urgent care clinics at all.
“This referral process can really slow down medical care,” he said, explaining how one of his employees was “sitting at home” in pain because of the wait to see a specialist. That employee visited the emergency room twice while waiting for an appointment, Payton said. 
“I think we should be evaluating whether or not the urgent care clinic is capable of diagnosing and treating more than we worry about how the patient got there and whether they were referred or not,” he said.
While he understood trying to get Medicaid recipients to get an appointment with a primary care provider, Payton said urgent care clinics also had licensed physicians and nurses capable of treating and diagnosing conditions. 
Irvin cautioned that it was important the department make its definitions within the rule clear after multiple lawmakers also asked questions about how the rule defined an emergent care clinic. She said many PCPs offer day clinics for these purposes and it was important that the rule didn’t cause them to be “skipped out on.”
Irvin ultimately moved the rule to the joint Human Services subcommittee for further consideration. The subcommittee is headed by Pilkington.
The agency received no public comments on the rule.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wetlands.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

May 14, 2025. | ScreenshotA former aide to former House Speaker Jason Wentworth (R-Farwell) has been charged with multiple counts of embezzlement and criminal enterprise.
Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office has been investigating David Coker Jr., 51, of Clare, since late 2023.
A spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Attorney General confirmed for the Michigan Advance that their office fulfilled search and arrest warrants as part of a “high-profile” investigation Wednesday morning but said Nessel will make more information available Thursday.
Court records confirm Coker was arraigned Wednesday in Lansing’s 54A District Court on seven charges. A probable cause conference is set for May 23.
Coker created a nonprofit that was awarded a $25 million no-bid grant written into the state budget by Wentworth, his former boss, Bridge Michigan reports.
Current House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said in a statement that “shady deals like this were the norm in Lansing for far too long.”
He said the deal demonstrates the need for a package of government ethics and transparency bills he sponsored.
“We’re going to let the Attorney General do her job and see this investigation through, keep an eye on what comes out during the proceedings to see if other changes are needed and continue passing new ethics and transparency measures across state government,” Hall said.

The state Department of Commerce received word of the canceled funding Friday. That was one day after President Donald Trump called the Digital Equity Act that created the grant program “racist” and “unconstitutional.”
The letter the U.S. Department of Commerce sent state officials on Friday followed the same logic, calling the digital equity program “unconstitutional.” It said “grants issued pursuant to it were created with, and administered using, impermissible and unconstitutional racial preferences.”
States across the nation have received similar notices.
The federal law, authored by Washington U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, was included in the bipartisan infrastructure package President Joe Biden signed in 2021. It is meant to help groups ranging from veterans, to disabled people, to older Americans and rural communities. People of color could also benefit from the federal money. 
In a call with reporters Wednesday, the Democratic senator said it is “absolutely nuts that Trump is blocking resources to help make sure kids in rural districts can get hotspots or laptops all because he doesn’t like the word ‘equity.’”
In total, the Digital Equity Act provided about $2.75 billion, with $60 million initially going to states in 2022 to develop equity plans for internet access. The feds then doled out money to put those plans into effect.
States led by Democrats and Republicans alike had been planning to spend the funding. Washington was awarded nearly $16 million in December, about a month before Trump took office.
The state Department of Commerce planned to spend the money on establishing a Broadband Cybersecurity Literacy Program so Washingtonians know how to use internet-related technology safely. The program would develop a curriculum to be incorporated into existing digital literacy training. Such training is included in the state’s Digital Equity Plan.
“It’s about building a future where every person in Washington, regardless of their background or where they live, has the resources and knowledge they need to participate fully in our digital society,” the state’s then-Commerce Director Mike Fong said at the time the grant was awarded.
Washington hadn’t spent any of the money, but was about to award a contract to develop the curriculum, said Commerce spokesperson Amelia Lamb.
Aaron Wheeler, the director of the Washington State Broadband Office, said the funding termination “perpetuates existing disparities that fall most heavily on our state’s rural communities.”
“It will increase inequalities,” Wheeler told reporters. “The digital divide will widen, further impacting vulnerable populations and limiting their access to education, employment, health care and civil engagement opportunities.”
The Trump administration is likely to face court challenges over the canceled grants, as it has for many other instances of terminated federal funding.
This money is separate from $1.2 billion Washington has received from the feds through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program. The funding, known by the acronym BEAD, goes toward directly improving internet infrastructure in rural communities and other areas lacking high-speed internet service. 
So far, the Trump administration hasn’t frozen that money. 
By the end of January, the state had received over 300 applications for pieces of that $1.2 billion. Wheeler expects to have a plan on how to spend the money submitted to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration by the fall. 
Some experts fear the Trump administration is trying to steer money away from fiber networks and toward satellite internet, with Elon Musk’s Starlink as a beneficiary of the change. 
But Washington is proceeding with caution, given the word “equity” is in the BEAD name. Wheeler said the state is waiting for further guidance from the telecommunications agency. 
“Things change overnight,” he added, “and we’re just kind of being very, very cognizant of what may be going on.”

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A federal appeals court on Wednesday found that the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Nation don’t have standing to bring a voting discrimination claim against the state of North Dakota.
The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 decision overturned a 2023 decision by a North Dakota federal judge that found the state’s 2021 redistricting plan unlawfully diluted the tribes’ voting power. 
Attorneys representing the tribes say the appellate court’s ruling eliminates voters’ ability to challenge racial discrimination under the Voting Rights Act in North Dakota and the six other 8th Circuit states.
The Campaign Legal Center in a Wednesday statement called the decision a “stunningly antidemocratic move.” 
“This decision severely undermines the Voting Rights Act and is contrary to both the intent of Congress in enacting the law and to decades of Supreme Court precedent affirming voters’ power to enforce the law in court,” said Mark Gaber, senior director for redistricting at the Campaign Legal Center.
Tribes, state argue redistricting case to federal appeals court

The appellate court already limited voters’ ability to challenge potential violations of the Voting Rights Act in 2023, when it decided private citizens cannot bring lawsuits under Section 2 of the law, which protects voters against racial discrimination. Only the U.S. attorney general can file such claims, the court ruled.
For a time, the question remained open as to whether voters have the right to bring those same allegations under a separate federal civil rights law: Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code.
On Wednesday, a panel of 8th Circuit judges decided the answer is no. The language of the Voting Rights Act does not authorize citizens to file race discrimination claims through Section 1983, Judge Raymond Gruender wrote in the majority opinion.
Chief Judge Steven Colloton dissented. He noted that Section 1983 says people may sue for “the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.”
“The reference to ‘and laws’ encompasses any law of the United States,” Colloton wrote.
His dissent also criticizes the court’s 2023 decision, writing that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act “expressly forbids ‘a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.’” Since 1982, private plaintiffs have brought more than 400 actions based under Section 2, he wrote.
The lawsuit originated from a legislative redistricting plan approved by the North Dakota Legislature in 2021 following the 2020 Census that put the Turtle Mountain and Spirit Lake reservations in new districts.
Judge selects legislative district map in tribal voting rights case

The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Spirit Lake Nation and three Native North Dakota voters in 2022 filed a federal lawsuit against the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office over the map, arguing the plan was discriminatory because it weakened the power of Native voters. The lawsuit was brought under both Section 1983 and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.
U.S. District Judge Peter Welte in 2023 ruled in favor of the tribes and in January 2024 ordered the map be substituted with one that placed the reservations in the same voting district.
The Secretary of State’s Office appealed the ruling, asking the 8th Circuit to overturn Welte’s decision on the basis that the tribes don’t have standing to sue and that the redistricting plan was not discriminatory. The parties presented oral arguments to the 8th Circuit in October.
North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley and Secretary of State Michael Howe did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.
In October, North Dakota Solicitor General Philip Axt argued on behalf of the Secretary of State’s Office. He told the judges that the plaintiffs want “to go back to an ancient regime where private rights were inferred from congressional silence.”
The 8th Circuit in its Wednesday order sent the case back to Welte and directed him to dismiss the lawsuit. It was not immediately clear what impact the decision could have on the voting districts. The appellate court’s opinion does not speak to the validity of the redistricting plan itself, only that the plaintiffs lack the right to sue in the first place.
“Today’s ruling wrongly forecloses voters disenfranchised by a gerrymandered redistricting map, as Native voters in North Dakota have been, from challenging that map under the Voting Rights Act,” Native American Rights Funds Staff Attorney Lenny Powell said in a Wednesday statement published by the Campaign Legal Center.
Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chairman Jamie Azure and Spirit Lake Nation Chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.
The court’s decision is only binding in the 8th Circuit, which includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri and Nebraska.

The federally mandated nonprofit, known as a protection and advocacy organization, was awaiting $700,000 of its federal funding for the current fiscal year. On May 1, it announced it would stop taking new cases as a result of the delay. 
The organization’s leaders said they can see the available funds in the online portal and are resuming all the services that were placed on pause. 
“I was very much elated to see the money had come in this morning,” said Polly Tribble, executive director at Disability Rights Mississippi. “It has allowed us to take a breather, so we aren’t looking at immediate layoffs.”
The organization received no explanation for the delay, DRMS Communications Director Jane Carroll told Mississippi Today. 
The delays affected five of the organization’s larger programs, funded through the Department of Health and Human Services. The programs allowed DRMS to investigate reports of neglect and abuse and to advocate for voter accessibility for those with disabilities – among other services.

However, there are a couple of other top-down changes already implemented or on the horizon, Tribble said.
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) launched a “defend the spend” initiative which mandates organizations like DRMS provide line-by-line justification of spending. So far, Tribble says her organization hasn’t received any pushback about its expenditures. 
Tribble and similar organizations in other states still have concerns about future funding, however.  A draft of President Donald Trump’s proposed 2026 budget shows eliminations or significant funding reductions of many of DRMS’ programs. 
“Our concern for FY ‘26 still remains … But for now, we’re celebrating this, and we will keep fighting for our clients this month ahead as they firm up a budget.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/06154617/3X0A9444.jpg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd) LOUISVILLE — Saying “hunger knows no political boundaries,” Dare to Care president and CEO Vincent James urged Congress not to cut Medicaid, SNAP and other safety-net programs. 
Doing so could increase an already “unimaginable” spike in food insecurity in the Louisville area and Southern Indiana, James said. 
James gathered with anti-hunger advocates and religious leaders in the Dare to Care food bank on Fern Valley Road Wednesday, the same day the nonprofit Feeding America released results from the latest Map the Meal Gap study, showing food insecurity is on the rise in the area. 
Over the last two years, Dare to Care has seen a 48% increase in food insecurity in the 13 counties it serves. In Louisville and the surrounding region, 1 in 7 people — including 1 in 5 children — live with food insecurity, which means they don’t have enough to eat and may not know where their next meal will come from. 
James said people are feeling the loss of pandemic-era assistance. “If you think back to 2020 when there were a lot of COVID benefits, you had child tax credits, you had so many other benefits that were coming to our community and to individuals to be able to help them to build that bridge of the gap that they had with their resources every month,” James said. “But when those benefits were cut around two or three years ago, we’re now seeing the impact of those cuts.” 
With Medicaid and SNAP — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — facing likely funding cuts in the Republican Congress, there’s a real concern that Dare to Care, which provides food to people who need it in parts of Kentucky and Southern Indiana, won’t be able to keep up, James said. 
“If you think about a senior who is getting Social Security and also some other benefits — Medicaid, Medicare — and now (if) those things are being cut, that means that they’ve got to pay for it in some kind of way — the money that they were using, most likely, for food,” James explained. “That’s when we actually see and hear stories where we have seniors who are adding water to soup so it can stretch longer. No one should be in that situation.”

Joining James were religious leaders — Archbishop Shelton J. Fabre from the Archdiocese of Louisville, Imam Muhammad Almoutem of the Muslim Community Center of Louisville, the Rev. Martin Brooks of Peace Catalyst International and several others — who said that their respective faiths call on them to feed all hungry people. 
Cantor David Lipp from Congregation Adath Jeshurun called feeding the hungry a religious and moral “mandate.” Fabre said feeding people is a way to recognize “basic human dignity.” 
Almoutem said “ignoring the people in need, and in particular the hungry people, is a form of sin” in his religion. 
These faith leaders gathered in support of Dare to Care and the continued funding of programs to feed and otherwise help people to, as James said, show a united front in the message that “no one will go hungry in our community again.” 
James added: “We’re deeply concerned about the increase of food insecurity that we’ve seen, the lack of access to being able to have access to fresh food we’ve seen, simultaneously faced with the threats and cuts to some of the nutritious programs that are run by our federal government.”
Map the Meal Gap
The 2025 Map the Meal Gap report, based on data from 2023, shows that about 70% of food insecure Kentuckians fall below the threshold that qualifies them for SNAP benefits; about 30% are above it. 
In total, 753,410 Kentuckians are food insecure, according to the report. In 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, that number was 644,540. 
Children, people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, immigrants, people with disabilities, formerly incarcerated people, single-parent households and people living in the South. are more likely to be food insecure, according to the report. 
Overall, nearly 17% of Kentuckians have a shortage of food, the new data shows.
Other data points from the report showed that nationally: 

Hungry people live in all — 100% — of counties and congressional districts. 
Child food insecurity affects every county and district, with rates reaching almost 50% in some areas. 
More than 12 million seniors and older adults experience food insecurity. 
86% of counties with the highest food insecurity are in the South. 
86% of counties with the highest food insecurity are rural. 
Among counties with available estimates, rates of food insecurity for Black or Latino individuals reach nearly 60%. 
More than 2 out of 5 people facing hunger are unlikely to qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 
The national food budget shortfall has risen to more than $32 billion. 
The national average cost per meal is $3.58 in 2023. 
County meal costs range from $2.60 to $6.09. 

Addressing this need is a “bipartisan effort,” James said. “We cannot afford any cuts to programs that are providing nutritious food for our neighbors.” 
“Every side knows that every human deserves the right to eat. It’s not even a question of a political stance,” he said. “It’s a question of your humanity, that each person has to have an opportunity to have access to food.”

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Trial attorney John Morgan took Tallahassee by storm on Wednesday as he joked, dropped f-bombs, and gave his “no bullshit” take on politics in America and Florida.
But when it was done and over, he maintained he is “serious” about a possible run for governor.
By his own reckoning, Morgan’s extensive experience with helping to finance proposed constitutional amendments for medical marijuana in 2016, increases in minimum wage in 2020, and legalization of marijuana in 2024, have given him the campaign chops he needs if he does choose to run for governor. 
Morgan also acknowledged he has plenty of name recognition due to his role as the founder and face of the Morgan & Morgan law firm.
He figures he can afford to wait and see how other candidates fare down the “home stretch.” He likened it to running a sprint rather than a marathon.
“I’d rather have a three-month window than an 18-month window,” he said.
While Morgan was less than firm about his run for office, he said he is moving ahead with real plans to form a third party in the state. A new party is necessary, he said, because the existing parties have been hijacked by factions that he doesn’t feel represent many of their members.
Republicans are controlled by supporters of Donald Trump as opposed to “country club Republicans,” Morgan said, while Democrats are in the thrall of progressives and “socialists” such as U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. He said that both sides refuse to compromise.
He argued that the polarization in the country is because many people are angry over income inequality and it helped lead Trump supporters to riot on Jan. 6.
“We’re stuck in the middle, and we don’t have a voice, any voice, but yet, we have a lot to say, but we’re paralyzed,” Morgan said. “So my belief is this: I believe that we need a third party.”

Morgan said he will choose the party’s name through a competition he will sponsor with a cash prize for the winning entry. He said he has already brought in a lawyer to help draft the paperwork to launch the party.
In addition to discussing his political future, Morgan weighed in on Florida’s current political events as well as its past.
He took repeated shots at DeSantis and said the 2023 insurance changes meant to lower property coverage rates were a “a money grab” for the governor to run for president.
“And who lost? Every homeowner in Florida. There’s going to be a day of reckoning. There’s going to be a hurricane, and it’s going to be bad,” he said.
Morgan facetiously spoke about DeSantis being a “hard-working governor,” noting that he saw him at the Kentucky Derby in Churchill Downs on May 3 and a Formula 1 sprint event at the Miami Grand Prix later the next day.
“So, he’s always working for us, constantly working for us and for our benefit,” Morgan said. 
Morgan conceded being a “billionaire” who lives in Maui during the winter. He says he “smokes a lot of dope out there” because it’s “relaxing.”
He recalled earlier this year getting texts and videos of the governor invoking his name “everywhere” and talking about his sway with members of the Legislature. Given the alleged influence he has over legislators, Morgan said he had a simple question for them: “When the f— are they gonna start doing what I tell them to do?”
He declared the Democratic Party of Florida dead and put the blame squarely on former Tallahassee mayor and 2020 Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Gillum, who lost his bid for governor by 34,000 votes in 2018 to DeSantis.
Morgan also opined that the Legislature shouldn’t meet every year but every other year instead.
“Because every time they meet they screw us over,” Morgan said.
He questioned whether Florida needs its Governor’s Mansion, a lieutenant governor, or agriculture commissioner.
He predicted the latest effort to legalize marijuana in Florida will pass despite the constitutional ballot changes the Legislature recently passed and DeSantis signed into law. 
“It’s sickening, because what it means is politicians want to have total control so they can take care of their special interests — cable companies, the fire companies, the sugar people. They don’t want us to have a say, because they know we, the people, are dangerous. We’re dangerous when we get to vote, and they don’t want that,” he said.

Under the plan, up to 512,000 adults in Michigan could lose coverage due to new, punitive work requirements.
This latest news comes at a time when Michiganders have sent a loud-and-clear message that they don’t want cuts to Medicaid. In fact, according to new statewide polling results released last week, 83% of Michigan voters across political views and party affiliations want to see Medicaid spending either increased or kept the same. EPIC·MRA, with support from the Community Mental Health Association of Michigan, Michigan Association of Health Plans, Michigan Health & Hospital Association, Michigan Primary Care Association, and Protect MI Care, conducted the new statewide poll to determine where Michiganders stand on the proposed Medicaid cuts. The poll also showed that 82% of Michiganders oppose cutting Medicaid to pay for tax cuts and 80% said Medicaid is important in their communities. 
More than 2.6 million Michiganders — including more than 1 million children — rely on Medicaid for their health care coverage. This includes 1 in 5 adults ages 19-64, 2 in 5 children, 3 in 5 nursing home residents, 1 in 6 Medicare beneficiaries and 3 in 8 working-age adults with disabilities.These are our family members, friends, co-workers and neighbors, and they live in every county in our state. Each and every one of them deserves to be able to access the care they need in order to live healthy lives. 
Health care providers, advocates urge Michigan congressional delegation to vote no on Medicaid cuts

In addition to providing health care coverage to nearly half of Michigan’s kids, Medicaid covered 45% of all babies born in our state last year and allows more than 270,000 older Michiganders to live safely at home or in caregiving facilities. It also serves as a lifeline for Michiganders seeking care at behavioral health and substance use treatment centers in rural and underserved areas, and, statewide, it protects families who otherwise couldn’t afford care from serious health consequences and insurmountable financial burdens. 
Medicaid is foundational to Michigan’s health care delivery systems, providing an essential source of funding for hospitals, nursing homes, Community Mental Health Services Programs, schools and Emergency Medical Services. The program brings over $19 billion in federal funding to Michigan, supporting care, providers and thousands of jobs. 
In addition to stripping health care away from hundreds of thousands of Michiganders, the implementation and administration of the House GOP’s proposed work requirements would lead to exorbitant administrative costs, with Michigan taxpayers footing a potential $155 million bill in the first year alone. This is funding that would be put to much better use as a means to maintain and, better yet, increase health care coverage for the people who call Michigan home.
The plan also proposes tax “reforms” that could result in a $3 billion annual loss in funding for our state, including a $2.3 billion decrease in payments to Michigan hospitals and upwards of $325 million in cuts to nursing homes. The closures of hospitals and other health care facilities are a real possibility under this plan, which would be deeply felt in rural and underserved areas where health care accessibility is already a major issue.
Let’s be clear: this new plan is an all-out assault on Medicaid that would push families off coverage, overwhelm hospitals with uncompensated care and deepen workforce shortages in essential health care services.
We here at the Michigan League for Public Policy continue to stand strong in our fight to protect Medicaid, and we do not stand alone. We stand together with the majority of Michiganders and the more than 150 organizations that make up the Protect MI Care coalition. The stakes right now could not be higher, which is why the League is proud to have helped launch the Protect MI Care coalition in order to build a united front against any cuts or caps to Medicaid. The health and well-being of Michiganders and our state economy depend on it.

(Photo by Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville participated in a charity golf tournament in Birmingham Wednesday, just hours before the U.S. Senate was scheduled to take up confirmations of personnel in President Donald Trump’s administration.
Tuberville was scheduled to appear at the 2025 Regions Tradition on Wednesday, a charity golf tournament located at the Greystone Golf & Country Club. Other people scheduled to appear included former Auburn football player Bo Jackson, Auburn head football Coach Hugh Freeze and UAB Head Football Coach Trent Dilfer.
“The senator is in Alabama today for a charity golf tournament that he goes to every year. He is planning to be back in D.C. for votes later this evening,” said Mallory Blount Jaspers, a spokeswoman for Tuberville, on Wednesday.
Tuberville participated in the charity event in 2023 and 2024, which is expected to raise more than $24 million with Children’s of Alabama, a pediatric acute care children’s hospital located in Birmingham.
The U.S. Senate schedule for the day includes a full slate of confirmation votes for senators to consider, including the morning, which Tuberville will likely forego while in Alabama.
The U.S. Senate generally holds a four-day work week, with the first vote on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and the last vote typically taking place Thursday afternoon at 1:45 p.m.
The Senate is set to be in recess for 15 weeks this year, in addition to the regular long weekends. The chamber was set to hold eight votes on Wednesday, including to confirm Emil Michael to be undersecretary for research and engineering at the Department of Defense and for Eric Ueland to become deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget.

Other members of the Senate have missed votes this year, including Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who was in South Korea in late April for the “Our Ocean Conference.” Whitehouse missed a vote on a measure to reject President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. That measure failed on a tied 49-49 vote.
It likely would have been approved had Whitehouse been there. Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who previously indicated opposition to Trump’s tariff policies, also missed the vote.
“The Our Ocean summit was important for Rhode Island and climate issues, and for preserving American leadership in the world,” Whitehouse said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “Ocean and climate problems are grave and serious and ignored. There would have been zero U.S. presence had I not attended.”
Whitehouse said he had informed leadership that he would be traveling on official business.
“I would have voted against Trump’s harmful tariffs had the vote not been called while I was away, but the measure was never going to become law in any event and calling the vote as a tie let us put J.D. Vance on record voting for the tariffs,” Whitehouse said.

Photo by David Goodman/VTDiggerThe Vermont Conversation with David Goodman is a VTDigger podcast that features in-depth interviews on local and national issues. Listen below and subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get podcasts.Mohsen Mahdawi is a free man. That has not come easily. It has taken a national human rights campaign to free Mahdawi and keep him free. He is among the first people in the country to be freed from detention under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. Mohsen Mahdawi is a Columbia University student and Palestinian activist who was arrested in Vermont by immigration agents last month at what he was told would be a citizenship interview. Mahdawi, 34, grew up in a refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank but is now a legal permanent resident living in Vermont. He is a practicing Buddhist and was president of the Columbia University Buddhist Association and he co-founded Columbia’s Palestinian Student Union.Mahdawi’s immigration interview on April 14 was supposed to be the last step in his 10-year journey to become a U.S. citizen. But it was a trap. Upon completing his interview, he was whisked away in unmarked SUVs by armed and masked federal agents. He was accused by the State Department of posing a threat to national security over his pro-Palestine campus activism. Mahdawi was keenly aware of President Trump’s ominous crackdown on immigrants. Other international students who were in the U.S. with valid student visas or were legal permanent residents were being snatched off the street and quickly shipped to a prison in Louisiana, where judges were more sympathetic to the Trump administration’s effort to deport them. Mahdawi alerted Vermont’s congressional delegation to his fear of being arrested and he contacted attorneys to act swiftly in the event he was detained. Just as he anticipated, the federal agents who arrested him hustled him to the Burlington airport where he was to be put on a plane to Louisiana. This followed a well-worn script — until Mahdawi missed his flight. That gave time for his lawyers to make an emergency appeal to Vermont federal Judge William Sessions III, who immediately issued an order blocking the Trump administration from removing him from Vermont. Mahdawi was in immigration custody in Vermont for 16 days. On April 30, Vermont Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered Mahdawi’s release on bail, comparing his arrest to the unlawful repression of free speech under McCarthyism. The Trump administration is continuing its effort to deport Mahdawi. For now, he can continue his fight for freedom outside of prison. (Disclosure: the ACLU of Vermont, where I am a board member, is part of Mahdawi’s legal team.) Mohsen Mahdawi is planning to attend his graduation from Columbia University next week and to begin graduate studies at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs in September.I met Mohsen Mahdawi near his home in the rural Upper Connecticut River Valley. He said he preferred to be outside in nature, his sanctuary. He asked me to join him on a favorite hike through a forest and up a hillside with beautiful views. Following is an excerpt of our Vermont Conversation edited for length and clarity. You can hear the full conversation at the audio link at the top of this article.David Goodman  You have just come out of several weeks in jail. What does it mean to you to be out here?Mohsen Mahdawi  My most beautiful memories of being in harmony, at peace and feeling tranquility happened in these mountains. This is the same path that I walked when I was processing my pain and going through healing for my trauma. Even though I was in prison, I was not imprisoned. I was able to imagine myself when I was in the cell, walking, hiking the forest, laying in a hammock, hearing this beautiful sound of water.David Goodman  What trauma are you referring to?Mohsen Mahdawi  I’m referring to the journey of my childhood, of the little Mohsen who grew up in a refugee camp, who has lived through war, who has been horrified by seeing loved ones being killed unjustly at the hands of the Israeli army. And the little Mohsen who thought many times that his life is about to be over, lived in trauma and pain and fear. The first place where I was able to process and to sit with those memories and the place that I felt safe, which I’m grateful for, was Vermont.David Goodman  How did growing up in a refugee camp in the West Bank lead you to Columbia University?Mohsen Mahdawi  Fire and pressure form something beautiful. The fire of injustice and the pressure of living in such difficult conditions, under basically military occupation and apartheid, pushed me forward. The magic recipe really is hope and education. I never gave up and I always believed in the idea of justice. My uncle, who was killed on my 11th birthday, was inspiration to remind me that my only way is education, that education is light, education is hope. David Goodman  What will it mean to you to walk across the stage at Columbia to get your bachelor’s degree?Mohsen Mahdawi  It means many things. I will be walking and thinking of my uncle’s spirit and praying that it’s hovering above me and seeing that the advice that he gave me has fueled my energy to get to this point. I want to also be an uncle to every child who grows up in severe and difficult conditions giving the same message that my uncle gave me, that education is light and education will open many paths for you to change the reality. And the last part is a message to the tyrants who don’t want me to graduate, who want me to lose this opportunity for making peace and bringing justice to my people and to both Israelis and Palestinians. It’s a message that no power in this world can take away from me, my power for imagination to see a peaceful future for the children, Israelis and Palestinians.David Goodman  You when you emerged from prison in Vermont two weeks ago, you addressed President Trump directly and said, “I am not afraid of you.” What did you mean by that? Mohsen Mahdawi  I wanted to say that intimidation, bullying, harassment will not stop me from working for this great cause for humanity, for democracy, for the Palestinian people. It is my life, it’s my family’s life, and I refuse to be silenced.David Goodman  You were going right to the heart of the power of an autocrat, which is fear. You were denying him that power.Mohsen Mahdawi  That’s exactly right. Nobody can take away from me the power of love that I have for the world or my ability to envision and imagine a better future, or my voice that I have to share with the world. The message was not only to President Trump, but also it was to my fellow students and Americans, the people who feel the intimidation and fear. I wanted to tell them that nobody can actually take power away from you unless you let them. This is the big fight between love and fear, intimidation, harassment, or yearning for peace and unity and equality.David Goodman  Is there anything you’re afraid of?Mohsen Mahdawi  I wouldn’t say I’m afraid of it, but if I die tomorrow, I would be really sad of not making peace between Palestinians and Israelis and changing the reality for the children on the ground, to change the direction from war and bloodshed into peace and coexistence.David Goodman  Why do you believe you were targeted for deportation?Mohsen Mahdawi  They are putting me through this, treating me unjustly, restraining my freedom, threatening my existence in this country and threatening my educational journey just because I’m advocating for human rights, for the end of war and for peace. One might think it is about Palestine, but the matter now is about our humanity. Who is the next person who is going to get detained? They started with the visa holder, then I am a green card holder, then they will come to naturalized citizens, and then to the citizens. And it’s the same in Palestine, they come after the people in Gaza, now they’re going after the people in the West Bank. We must stand up against it and say no to it, divest from war, invest in peace, and strengthen international law.David Goodman  Secretary of State Rubio wrote in a memo justifying your arrest that your activism “could undermine the Middle East peace process by reinforcing antisemitic sentiment,” and when you were released from jail, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said, “When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans and harass Jews, that privilege should be revoked and you should not be in this country.” What is your response to those two statements?Mohsen Mahdawi  I’ve been advocating for justice and peace. I’ve been a peacemaker on campus. Yes, I’m a strong advocate for the Palestinian rights, but I have partners, mainly Jewish and Israeli partners. See the letters that have been written in my support, the protests that Israelis actually did in New York City in support of me and listen to the Jewish professors at Columbia University. They’re weaponizing the idea of antisemitism for their own purposes. They’re trying to intimidate people and to justify their unjust detention. David Goodman  What is your feeling about violent resistance? Mohsen Mahdawi  I never advocated for violence. I believe in nonviolence as the best path towards peace and justice. I believe like Gandhi believes that truth and justice have their own power. I advocate for compassion and empathy. The Jewish trauma and the Palestinian trauma are intertwined and interconnected. David Goodman  Judge Crawford in releasing you cited your ties to your community and noted that the court had received more than 90 statements and letters from community members, academic experts and professors, “many of them Jewish,” attesting to your character. What did that mean to you?Mohsen Mahdawi  I felt so grateful for all of the love and support from the Jewish community, from my professors, from many people who I didn’t know before. What matters really is the light of hope that those letters signal to Americans as a whole. It breaks it through this polarization of one side or the other, Israelis and Palestinians. The reality is we are human beings who are yearning to see a diplomatic resolution for this long bloody conflict. I joke sometimes and say I don’t think I’ve ever felt that much love and support anywhere else as much as I felt inside the cell.David Goodman  You speak of hope and love, and yet so much suffering has gone on in your life and is going on in the West Bank and in Gaza, with over 50,000 Gazans killed, some 1500 Israelis killed. What gives you this ability to stay hopeful?Mohsen Mahdawi  It is my practical experience. One of my earliest realizations in America was that if there is an enemy, it would be fear, ignorance and segregation. What people who are in power are trying to do is to tell us that we should fear the other, whether if it’s Republicans fearing Democrats, black fearing white, Palestinians fearing Israelis and vice versa. When we come together, we realize we are way more than what divides us. Actually our difference enriches our existence. We just have to break through fear,  with empathy, understanding, through feeling each other’s pain.David Goodman  Vermont may be the first place in America where judges freed people in immigration custody, freeing you and Tufts student Rumeysa Ozturk. Mohsen Mahdawi  Vermont is the place in America that is becoming the beating heart of hope and life. It signals to Americans all 50 states that the system of democracy is still functioning. It is and communicating to everybody don’t give up, because we have a justice system that holds the system with checks and balances.David Goodman  What do you hope to do after you’re finished with your education?Mohsen Mahdawi  My purpose in life is to make peace. There is no peace without justice, so to figure out a method with restorative justice, to see children living in a peaceful future and equality. This is what I dedicated my life for. This is why I went back to school. I see myself as a peacemaker, as a diplomat. David Goodman  What is your message to other immigrants who are afraid right now?Mohsen Mahdawi  You’re not alone. There are many other people who are like you, feeling afraid from the direction that politics is going in this country. In every situation of darkness, there is always light. Don’t be intimidated by the fear but try to understand it and channel it in a beautiful, creative way. I choose to see the good people in this country who are working tirelessly to change the situation. Vermont has showed up in an unbelievable, beautiful, inspiring way, and it is paving away for the rest of the country what it means to have a community that is supportive and empathetic and kind and welcoming.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Conversation: A walk in the woods with Mohsen Mahdawi.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mohsen-Mahdawi-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

(Amelia Ferrell Knisely | Courtesy photo)West Virginia Watch reporter Amelia Ferrell Knisely has placed second in the Dan Rather Medals for News and Guts competition.
Knisely won for her reporting for West Virginia Watch, which “fought for transparency in West Virginia’s overwhelmed foster care system.”
For six months, Knisely requested from the West Virginia Department of Human Services documents that show how much the state spent on housing foster children in hotels in 2023. Instead of financial documents, the department sent Knisely a mostly redacted report on children staying in hotels, motels, offices and hospitals between January and October 2023. With that report, she wrote her award-winning article, “WV agency won’t release docs showing where money was spent putting foster kids in hotels.”
“The level of neglect exposed by this reporting is reprehensible,” one of the judges wrote. “The amount of work it took to get the information, public information, to shed light on this was incredible.” And in the email informing Knisely of her win, John Bridges, a lecturer in journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, where the awards are housed, wrote: “Indeed, your work was just the kind of dogged reporting that Dan Rather had in mind when he created these awards with the University of Texas.”
Knisely original records request was denied, former Gov. Jim Justice’s office did not respond to her emails and a then DoHS spokesperson denied her interview request with state child welfare leaders.
“Despite their intimidation, insults and ongoing resistance to answering my questions, I persist and have a great newsroom behind me.” Knisely told the Dan Rather Medals for News and Guts. “I’m still covering foster care and will continue to do so. These children deserve it.” 
Knisely joined West Virginia Watch when the outlet launched in July 2023. She has been covering West Virginia’s foster care system since 2019. Over the years, she’s spoken with foster children abused in out-of-state facilities, child protective services workers who can’t keep up with caseloads, biological parents who want answers and foster parents who feel lost in a complex system. She’s written about state leaders’ attempts — or lack thereof — to fix the problems, and spotlighted organizations helping vulnerable children.

(Photo by Evgeniia Siiankovskaia/Getty Images)Even now, amid all of this, I believe people generally have good intentions.
I can see the power grabs and veiled malevolence that have always been there, rising through the years with different faces and forms, but the perception of a broader shift toward darkness seems to be based on a couple of behavioral factors: Just about everybody wishes themself well, but the desire to extend that wish to others varies greatly; and just about everybody is afraid, but not of the same things.
When our politics are heavily reliant on exploiting those two factors, as now, anger and insecurity are inevitable. And with widespread anger and insecurity comes volatility. 
In New Hampshire, the debate over public education helps tell this story.
If as a society we could extract politics and taxation from the idea of public education, to be pro or anti public school teacher would make as much sense as being pro or anti breathing. Learning opportunities offered to all and equally, in thriving local schools, would serve as the mic drop for why community is preferable to isolation.
Food, shelter, and three big public offerings: safety, health care, and education. That’s what you need to stake a claim on the outskirts of Utopia. But like a bunch of self-sabotaging klutzes, we keep kicking each one out of reach every time we bend down with grasping hands. Corporate greed is largely to blame, but as voters and consumers we consistently sanction that greed.
So, when we reapply politics and taxation to the equation, that’s when the wheels come off for New Hampshire.
The state is too reliant on property taxes to pay for public education, which translates into one of the highest effective property tax rates in the nation. Meanwhile, there is a complete lack of political will to even discuss more progressive taxation to ease property-tax burdens. What would it look like to have an income tax that exists purely, and via constitutional amendment, to fund public education without that money ever being dropped into the general fund abyss? Who knows, because the conversation is shut down before it starts.
“Why don’t you move to Massachusetts, you damned socialists!” End of talk.
With this conscious aversion, New Hampshire has not only accepted its property-tax fate but embraced it. The result is such intense pressure on property-tax payers, and without any real avenues for remediation, that public schools have become twice victimized. Once through a broken and unfair funding system, and again through the misplaced anger of the tax-burdened public they serve.
The Republican solution is a multipronged effort to break apart public schools as we know them through policies such as universal school vouchers and open enrollment. I’m sure many in the GOP earnestly see these linked efforts as the best option available, with any and all tax solutions purposely off the table, but the result is like covering up structural flaws with a coat of paint. It may look fine on the outside, but it doesn’t pass inspection.
Vouchers, for example, are clearly not going to public school students seeking more desirable educational opportunities, as pitched. About 80% of the students tapping the state’s “education freedom accounts” program were not public school students to begin with but are home schooled or already attending private, often Christian, schools. So, far from easing the burden on taxpayers, the voucher program makes things worse by siphoning tens of millions of dollars away from the same schools that residents are struggling to pay for.
Open enrollment efforts, meanwhile, sound the death knell for those same local schools that on another timeline would be celebrated as the community triumph and treasure that they are. Why, I wonder, would we ever want to create winners and losers among public schools that exist to educate all and equally?
Any divide between residents and their community schools is artificial and political in nature. Property taxes are too high, and people can’t afford them. Rather than acknowledging the brokenness of that system, too many lawmakers and the monied interests behind them have worked to redirect the resulting anger toward the very people who, in various school district capacities, have dedicated their lives to helping assure better futures for our kids. They are wasting your hard-earned money on their failed schools, the conditioned pitchfork mob shouts, and even worse they are indoctrinating your kids with all kinds of wokeness.

(Photo courtesy of Boeing)A $96 billion deal with Qatar Airways will give Boeing its largest order ever for South Carolina-made planes, the White House announced Wednesday.
The order of up to 210 jumbo jets is part of $244 billion worth of economic deals between the U.S. and Qatar agreed to while President Donald Trump is visiting the country, according to a White House fact sheet.
The agreement is for 130 of the 787 Dreamliners made in Charleston County and 30 of the 777 planes built in Washington state, with an option for an additional 50 planes of some combination of the two, according to a Boeing news release.
The order breaks three records for Boeing, the company said: It is the largest ever for its “widebody jets,” generally meaning jets with two aisles that can carry lots of passengers on long flights. It is the largest for the 787 Dreamliners made in North Charleston. And it is Qatar Airways’ largest-ever order.
“A major victory for Boeing, North Charleston, and all of South Carolina,” Gov. Henry McMaster wrote on X. “Thank you to President Trump for making this investment possible and for continuing to put American manufacturing first.”
Boeing employs about 8,200 people in South Carolina, most of them in Charleston County.
“We are deeply honored that Qatar Airways has placed this record-breaking order with Boeing, one that solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center,” Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in the release.
The purchase will make Qatar Airways the largest operator of 787 Dreamliners in the Middle East.
The airline already operates more than 150 Boeing airplanes, including 777 and 787 passenger jets and 777 Freighters, according to Boeing.
Since 2014, Qatar Airways has ordered 94 777X planes and 30 Dreamliners, according to data from Boeing.
The aircraft will be powered by American-made engines from GE Aerospace.
Producing and delivering the planes will support 154,000 domestic jobs annually and more than a million positions over the course of production, according to the White House.
Deals like the Boeing agreement will help “drive innovation and prosperity for generations, bolster American manufacturing and technological leadership, and put America on the path to a new Golden Age,” the White House said.
The company’s CEO Kelley Ortberg joined President Donald Trump and other officials in Doha for the announcement.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham emphasized that this was Boeing’s largest ever widebody and 787 order, dubbing the deal a “game changer” for the company and South Carolina.
“Qatar Airways’ purchase will ensure the Charleston plant has work for many years to come and it is a validation of the work product coming from the Charleston Boeing facility,” Graham said in a statement. “The Boeing workforce in South Carolina has a lot to be proud of – they consistently work hard and provide great airplanes.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/787-Dreamliner-family_2025-1024x524.jpg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)First Lady Casey DeSantis on Wednesday denounced the criticism about her Hope Florida charity program in her harshest terms to date, while maintaining that she remains open about a potential run next year to succeed her husband in office.
The DeSantises appeared at a Brandon church in eastern Hillsborough County to host a roundtable discussion about the virtues of Hope Florida, the social services initiative led by the First Lady that aims to help Floridians in need.
The program itself has come under fire following reports last month from the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald that the Hope Florida Foundation last year quietly and quickly moved a $10 million “donation” from a settlement with a health care company that the state contracts with to two nonprofit political committees that did not have to list their donors.
Those political committees then sent $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, the main group opposing the constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis in Florida — an initiative that Gov. DeSantis opposed.
Claiming that Hope Florida represents one of the “only meaningful reforms” to the welfare state since President Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” programs from the late 1960s, Ms. DeSantis said it was “really disheartening and very sad, but not surprising, to see these slanderous false accusations hurled at Hope Florida in an attempt to undermine all of the meaningful progress that we’ve had on so many families across the state of Florida.”
“We are not going to be dissuaded by the critics who have been captivated by willful ignorance, and we will not allow any politics to drown out the voices of families who have told us over and over for the first time that they feel a sense of hope. Hope Florida is not a program,” she said. “Hope Florida is a movement.”
The governor and his wife have held multiple press events over the past two months defending the program and assailing Florida House Republicans and news reporters who have investigated it as having a political agenda.
The House Committee investigating the allegations ended its work nearly three weeks ago and, unless the federal government intervenes, the controversy may be over for the time being.
But those news reports have done nothing to boost a potential run for governor for Casey DeSantis in 2026. That’s led to questions about how serious she actually is about entering the race. A report published earlier on Wednesday in the Miami Herald speculated that the odds of her pulling the trigger are diminishing by the day.
‘The GOAT’
With Southwest Florida U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds already on the campaign trail and raising considerable money through his main political committee, a Phoenix reporter asked her on Wednesday where she stood on a possible gubernatorial candidacy for 2026?
“I get why this is a big conversation,” she acknowledged. “But I can also say it’s more than a year away from qualifying. I mean, I think we need to be thinking about what people put people in office to do, to try to make sure that they’re delivering on the promises that they told the people that they were going to do when they first got elected.”
She labeled Ron DeSantis “The GOAT” (Greatest of all Time),  adding that whomever “he ultimately decides who should be following up after him should be somebody I think was obviously there for the people of the state of Florida.”
That person “should be in the mold of a DeSantis who’s willing to get out there and fight,” Ms. DeSantis said, eliciting a huge response from the approximately 100 people who’d gathered at the ARISE Church.
The First Lady’s comments bolster the notion that the governor is seeking a candidate he can fully back next year to maintain his legacy — someone other than Donalds, who has already been endorsed by President Donald Trump.
Other potential candidates, like former Attorney General Ashley Moody and former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez, have now moved into other positions and taken themselves out of the running — DeSantis appointed Moody to replace Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate and Nuñez is interim president at Florida International University, soon perhaps to be president in full.
Fresh reports
The Miami Herald published a story earlier on Wednesday quoting Republican consultants (not all by name) who speculated that the combination of negative publicity around Hope Florida and Donalds’ Trump-backed candidacy was making it less likely that Ms. DeSantis will run to succeed her husband.
But Ron DeSantis blasted the story, asserting that the Herald had been “concocting hoaxes” when it came to reporting about his administration during the Covid crisis, “and so I’m very skeptical of discredited outlets in terms of what they do.”
A recent public opinion survey of Republican voters initially showed Casey DeSantis in a virtual tie with Donalds in the race for the Florida GOP nomination. However, after the voters polled were informed that Trump had endorsed Donalds, he took the lead over Mrs. DeSantis by 19 percentage points.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-14 20:04:57+00:00,CT Mirror,CT House passes bill to regulate social media use for kids,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/14/ct-social-media-bill-kids-online-safety/,"Following what some called a lack of federal action, the CT House passed a bill to restrict the use of social media algorithms on children.","In what Connecticut legislative leadership called the absence of meaningful action from Congress, the state’s House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill to restrict the use of social media algorithms on children.
House Bill 6857 would require social media sites that use personalized algorithms to suggest content to determine whether the user is a minor, and if they are a minor to get consent from the child’s guardian. 
It also limits notifications on suggested content on social media sites to one hour a day and bans them outside the hours of 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., unless the minor has parental consent for more notifications. 
These types of algorithms are common with platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. They work by gathering data about the user, then suggesting particular content to them. For example, if a user shows an interest in cats, the algorithm will show them more videos of cats. Part of the concern about algorithms stems from fear that teenagers particularly may seek out content about eating disorders or suicidal tendencies, then be fed content that encourages those thoughts.
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said the bills would likely draw lawsuits if passed, but that something had to be done to protect Connecticut’s children. 
“I think people are sick of saying ‘We can’t,’ and throwing their hands up. I think they’re saying you’ve got to put pen to paper and do try to do something, because there have been severe problems with bullying and all types of stuff on social media, or wrong feeds or inappropriate feeds, and they’re trying to better verify age for the content that people see,” Ritter said during a morning press briefing.
The bill passed with bipartisan support, although Republicans were concerned about how it would be enforced. There have also been other groups nationwide, including some liberal groups, that have said some teenagers who may not get support at home find community online, and access to that community shouldn’t be restricted.
Gov. Ned Lamont on Wednesday said he supports the bill.
“I think when it comes to protecting kids, making sure the parents have control over those under the age of 18, for example, making sure you have the age verification makes pretty good sense,” Lamont said. “Obviously some of the big social media companies are bringing lawsuits against a couple of states that have tried to do this, but I think it’s a step in the right direction.”
Kids’ online safety has been a signature issue for U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who proposed the Kids Online Safety Act to ask social media companies to prioritize kids’ well-being and regulate the addictive nature of some sites.
The bill passed the Senate during the last session but stalled in the House. On Wednesday, Blumenthal reintroduced the measure.
The Connecticut bill has vague language around how social media platforms should determine whether someone is a minor. It says the platforms should use “commercially reasonable and technically feasible methods,” to figure out users’ ages.
General Law Committee vice-chair Rep. Gary Turco, D-Newington, said the bill aims to protect children and offer basic regulation around social media. It leans on parental consent for use of social media.
The goal, in part, is to encourage families to have more conversations about social media use, Democrats said.
“As somebody with three teenagers, it’s hard to be in all three bedrooms at the same time wondering if they’re looking at their phone or not,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. “So it becomes a question of, are there some basic regulations that can be put in place to help parents navigate what is a very challenging situation?”
House Minority Leader Rep. Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, questioned why Democrats would want to regulate kids’ access to social media but not library books, although the bill would regulate notifications and algorithms that push content rather than books children choose from the library shelves.

He’s concerned about pornography in libraries, he said. Librarians across the state have argued against restrictions on what books are available in libraries.
“Whether it’s pushed or it’s accessible to children, we need to make sure that children have the right access to materials, age appropriate information, and so this social media bill strikes at that, and I think our library should do the same,” Candelora said.
The bill would be enforced by the state’s attorney general and originates from Attorney General William Tong’s office. The office would be able to investigate complaints and sue companies over violations. It would also get regular reports about social media use in Connecticut from the companies.
Christopher Gilrein, executive director of the northeast region for TechNet, an organization that represents businesses in the innovation sector, submitted public testimony opposing the bill. He said the algorithm is integral to the experience of many platforms.
“HB 6857 is built on the assumption that an algorithmically curated feed is inherently harmful and contains a subjective definition of ‘Addictive feed,’” Gilrein said in public testimony. “An algorithmic feed boosts user engagement precisely because it shows users information and posts that are most relevant to them; posts from their friends, family, and interests are prioritized.”
Republicans said Wednesday they feared the bill would violate free speech rights and would be difficult to enforce.
“I find this bill to be unconstitutional, an infringement on rights,” said Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott. “I don’t understand why this body seems to think they can co-parent.”

“The EPA has the fundamental role of creating and enforcing safeguards for our water. Today’s action by the Trump EPA does just the opposite,” Sandy Wynn-Stelt, co-chair of the Great Lakes PFAS Action Network said in a statement. “Drinking water contaminated with toxic PFAS chemicals is linked to numerous health impacts and threatens the health of communities in Michigan and beyond. We are calling on members of Congress to do everything they can to oppose these rollbacks and protect our drinking water from toxic PFAS contamination.”
In April 2024, the EPA finalized drinking water standards, creating legally enforceable maximum contaminant levels for multiple types of PFAS — also known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — and setting hazard index contaminant levels for mixtures containing two or more of the following substances: PFHxS, PFNA, HGPO-DA or PFBS.
Under these regulations, public water systems were required to adopt PFAS monitoring and compliance practices by 2027, and implement solutions to reduce PFAS levels above the maximum contaminant levels by 2029 or face penalties for violations.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the EPA on Wednesday said that it would rescind the maximum contaminant levels for three types of PFAS: PFHxS, PFNA and HFPO-DA which is commonly known as GenX. It would also eliminate the hazard index levels for the named PFAS mixtures.
While the EPA will maintain the 4 parts per-trillion limit for PFOS and PFOA, the agency plans to extend the compliance deadline from 2029 to 2031. 
PFAS are often called forever chemicals, as the substances break down very slowly. They have been tied to several health issues including increased risk for prostate, kidney and testicular cancers, harms to the immune system, decreased fertility, high blood pressure in pregnant women and developmental delays or effects on children.
While Michigan has its own PFAS regulations, the EPA’s rules created a stricter standard than what was required by the state, with the Great Lakes PFAS Action Network warning the decision would have devastating effects on Michigan communities, especially those already facing PFAS contamination.
Members of the National Wildlife Federation, a member of the coalition, further criticized the decision for its impact on wildlife, arguing the decision ignores evidence of the harms these chemicals bring. 
“The science is clear: Toxic forever chemicals are dangerous for people and wildlife alike — rescinding recent, historic standards makes no sense,” Rebecca Meuninck, Great Lakes Regional Executive Director for the National Wildlife Federation said in a statement. “The EPA is ignoring strong science that shows these chemicals harm people, wildlife, and the environment. Delaying action on any PFAS only allows further contamination of our waters and wildlife.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-10171059-1024x746.jpg,,,2025-05-14 16:10:41.002662

(Photo courtesy USAO)U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) on Wednesday sent a letter to the United States Department of Defense, asking leaders for information on how  they are operating a newly designated military zone along New Mexico’s border with Mexico and whom they might be arresting within it.
Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others touted the creation of a National Defense Area along New Mexico’s 170-mile border with Mexico. The new designation meant that land under Interior Department control effectively became part of a military base in Arizona and made trespass there a criminal offense punishable by up to a year in jail and a $100,000 fine. 
According to a Source New Mexico analysis, the newly designated military base covers an area of 400 square miles, though Defense officials say the new criminal penalties do not apply to the state and private land within that area.
Still, Heinrich and groups including the American Civil Liberties Union have raised concerns about the new zone and whether it will have unintended consequences for American citizens or the state of New Mexico. Some New Mexico State Land Office land is within the 400-mile area. The end of the 3,100-mile Continental Divide Trail is also within the National Defense Area, Heinrich noted.
“I have deep concerns that the Trump Administration is bypassing due process for individuals who either intentionally or unintentionally enter this newly restricted area, including United States citizens who may be stopped and detained by U.S. Army soldiers for trespassing on an unmarked military base,” Heinrich wrote to Secretary Hegseth.
Defense officials have said the new military zone allows it to use more resources and crack down harder on illegal border crossings. Several hundred people have faced new criminal charges so far since late April, according to federal court records.
However, United States Attorney for New Mexico Ryan Ellison has had to defend the new process in court in response to a judge’s concerns over whether people being arrested had adequate warning that they could face criminal charges, among other legal considerations. 

Read Heinrich’s letter here

Heinrich’s letter included a dozen questions about practical and legal considerations about the new zone, though he said he understands the Defense Department’s “states interest in reducing migrant crossings at the border.” 
Some of Heinrich’s questions include: 

“Can the New Mexico State Land Office access state land within the NDA? Can lease or permit holders on state land within the NDA continue to utilize those state trust lands pursuant to those leases or permits?”
“How many mining claims are within the boundary of the NDA?”
“It has been reported that at least 300 individuals have been detained within the NDA area since the designation. How many of these individuals were U.S. citizens or were legally present in the United States?”
“Does the NDA limit road access to any private property within the boundaries of the NDA? If so, how is the department providing access to those private property owners?”

Heinrich ends the letter noting that the residents of southern New Mexico have “longstanding relationships with these lands.” 
“As such, decisions that significantly alter their access or legal standing must be made transparently and with meaningful consultation. Further, it is of upmost importance that federal laws and the Constitution are upheld,” Heinrich wrote.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image001-e1746120014744-1024x1003.jpg,,,2025-05-14 16:10:41.002662

(Mariah Freschi)This article first appeared on KFF Health News.
For nearly three agonizing years, Mariah Freschi and her husband have been trying to have a second baby. The California mother recently underwent surgery to remove her blocked fallopian tubes, leaving in vitro fertilization as her only option to get pregnant. But the cost quoted by her Sacramento-area clinic was $25,000 — out of reach for Freschi, a preschool teacher, and her husband, a warehouse worker.
“When we first found out IVF was our only option, it just felt so overwhelming,” said Freschi, who has insurance through the California marketplace. “No one sets aside 20, 30 grand to grow your family.”
The Freschis are far from alone in requiring medical assistance to have children: About 13% of women and 11% of men in the U.S. experience infertility, while others are in a same-sex relationship, single or want to preserve their eggs or sperm before undergoing various medical treatments.
And, like the Freschis, many Americans do not have health insurance that pays for IVF.
During his campaign, President Donald Trump vowed that the government would cover IVF or require insurers to cover it. In February, he signed an executive order seeking policy recommendations on expanding IVF access, dubbing himself the “fertilization president” a few weeks later.
Whether the administration’s efforts will change policy remains unknown, but state-level attempts to mandate fertility coverage reveal the gauntlet of budgetary and political hurdles that such initiatives face — obstacles that have led to millions of people being left out.
“There are economic opponents, and there are ideological opponents,” said Sean Tipton, a lobbyist for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. “It is a tough lineup of opponents. And that’s very consistent from state to state.”
Twenty-two states have passed legislation requiring insurers to cover at least some fertility care, and 15 of those require coverage for IVF. The laws vary widely, though, when it comes to who and what gets covered, largely because of debates over cost. Fertility services can range from diagnostic testing and ovulation-enhancing drugs to IVF, widely considered the most effective but also the most expensive treatment, during which one or more lab-fertilized eggs are transferred to a uterus.
It’s mostly those footing the bill amid rising health care costs and state deficits that have voiced opposition. State insurance mandates “factor in significantly” when it comes to whether employers continue to provide coverage at all because of financial concerns, according to Chris Bond, a spokesperson for AHIP, which represents health insurers, who also said employers “want to have flexibility with how these benefits are structured.”
States cite concerns about higher premiums and the budget impact of having to cover government workers. In the past few years, infertility coverage bills in Minnesota, North Dakota and Louisiana, for example, failed largely over cost.
IVF advocates, however, cite data from a decade ago showing that fertility care in states with mandates has accounted for less than 1% of total premium costs, a figure similar to estimates for newer mandates. And advocates often argue that building a family is a human right, though fertility care is disproportionately used by wealthy, white women. Covering IVF for the Medicaid population, which includes more than 70 million Americans, rarely works its way into legislative proposals.
The California example
California is a case study in how many of these conversations play out. Cost concerns sank IVF legislation in the state for several years before lawmakers approved a mandate last year. SB 729 goes into effect July 1 and requires large employers with state-regulated health insurance to cover infertility diagnosis and treatment, including IVF. State employees will get coverage in 2027.
Few states cover fertility treatment for same-sex couples, but that could be changing

California’s mandate is considered one of the most comprehensive and inclusive in the country, said Barbara Collura, president of Resolve: The National Infertility Association, making same-sex couples and single parents eligible for coverage. But it still leaves out most of the state’s insured population, including those covered by Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act marketplace and self-insured companies, which account for the majority of workers and are federally regulated.
Mimi Demissew, executive director of Our Family Coalition, an LGBTQ+ rights nonprofit that co-sponsored SB 729, said her group envisioned the broadest possible mandate, which would have included people covered by small employers, the marketplace and other privately purchased plans. “We dreamed big,” she said. “But the pushback and the whittling down was because of the budget.”
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s finance department opposed SB 729 over concerns about the state’s budget and higher premiums. And groups representing the state’s health plans and employers cited costs in their opposition, with the California Chamber of Commerce calling health care “one of the most formidable expenses a business experiences,” per a legislative analysis.
The law going into effect this year is estimated to cover around 9 million people, 5 million fewer than originally proposed. Annual premiums, whose cost is typically shared by employers and employees, are projected to increase for people with state-regulated health insurance by approximately $40 per person covered in the first year.
Mandates vary widely by state
More than 10 states — including California — have what fertility experts call “comprehensive” coverage, which requires some insurers to cover IVF with minimal restrictions. But even in those states, large swaths of the population miss out.
In Massachusetts, which has one of the country’s oldest, broadest mandates for infertility coverage, including IVF, only about 30% of women were eligible as of 2019.
Those covered by these mandates, however, are grateful. Luisa Lopez, a nonprofit executive, credited the three IVF cycles that New York’s mandate covered with allowing her and her husband to have a baby after 10 years of trying.
“I feel very lucky to live in a state that prioritized this,” Lopez said. Still, she said, she was on the hook for thousands of dollars in copays and other costs.
In states with narrow mandates, coverage is elusive. With limited exceptions, only state employees have qualified for IVF coverage through Utah’s mandate, for example. Joseph Letourneau, a University of Utah fertility specialist who successfully lobbied for fertility preservation coverage for Medicaid patients and state employees with cancer, said he couldn’t recall ideological opposition to fertility coverage but that some legislators were concerned about raising costs.
Oklahoma and Kentucky limit coverage requirements to patients who wish to preserve their fertility because of specific medical conditions.
Pushback beyond costs
Some opponents of IVF coverage say life begins at the moment of conception and have expressed concerns about the disposal of embryos during the IVF process.
Potential threats to IVF push political novices into election-year advocacy

Chieko Noguchi, a spokesperson for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the Catholic Church teaches that IVF is morally wrong because it “involves the death or freezing of embryonic children and treats human beings like products that can be bought and ordered.”
In Republican-controlled-Georgia, some advocates say the proposal of abortion restrictions has distracted from efforts to mandate fertility coverage. SisterSong, a reproductive justice nonprofit, supports two bills that would require private insurers and Medicaid to cover IVF in Georgia. But, the organization’s director of maternal health and birth equity initiatives, Leah Jones, acknowledged a steep uphill battle given the costs and anti-abortion legislation that some advocates fear could criminalize IVF. Having to fight just for the legality of IVF, she said, detracts from expanding access.
“We’re always on the defense,” Jones said.
Several states, including Georgia, are weighing or have passed bills that would protect access to IVF after Alabama’s state Supreme Court ruled that embryos created through IVF should be considered children, leading to temporary suspension of those services. Zemmie Fleck, executive director of Georgia Right to Life, said the Georgia anti-abortion bill would not make IVF illegal.
This fissure in Trump’s base over protecting versus restricting or even prohibiting IVF has raised questions about how his executive order will play out. Letourneau of Utah said some of his patients have asked if the order will cover their treatment costs.
The White House did not respond to requests for comment.
An uncertain road ahead
While a growing number of companies provide IVF coverage as a health benefit, most patients are left to find ways to pay on their own. Some have turned to loans — IVF financing startups such as Gaia and Future Family have raised millions in venture funding.
The Freschis have applied for grants, are crowdfunding, and have put their upcoming cycle on a credit card.
“It’s so scary,” said Freschi, describing worries about potential unexpected IVF costs. “It just feels like you’re constantly walking around with a weight on you.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As an anticipated reduction to the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments by the Trump administration looms, Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren is calling for the monuments to be kept at their current sizes in the name of efficiency.
“In light of the current administration’s stated priorities on efficiency and reducing waste, we believe that maintaining the integrity of established monument boundaries supports those goals,” Nygren wrote in a letter to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, according to a post by the Navajo leader on X. “Changing the boundaries and reopening finalized planning processes would not only risk the loss of valuable progress but may also lead to inefficiencies, duplicative expenditures, and delays in implementing conservation strategies.”
The letter asks that no changes to the monuments’ sizes be made without a meaningful dialogue with “all tribal nations with ancestral ties to these lands.”
Poll: Utah voters, regardless of political party, support Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante

In his confirmation hearing, Burgum hinted at support for reducing the monuments and echoed Utah leaders’ criticism of use of the Antiquities Act to put protections on large areas of land. 
Bears Ears has deep spiritual and cultural importance to a number of Indigenous peoples, including the Diné, or Navajo, Nygren said in his post, noting that like neighboring Grand Staircase it is a “revered landscape.”
The monuments in southeastern Utah have been a political football for multiple presidential administrations, starting with the establishment of Grand Staircase in 1996 by President Bill Clinton who used his power under the Antiquities Act, a law passed in 1906 that gives the president authority to declare national monuments to protect areas of cultural, historical and scientific significance.
President Barack Obama then used the Antiquities Act at the end of his term in 2016 to give monument status to Bears Ears, an area tribes had long lobbied to protect.
Both monuments were scaled back by President Donald Trump when he took office in 2017, cutting Bears Ears from 1.36 million acres to 1 million acres, and Grand Staircase-Escalante from 1.35 million acres to 229,000 acres. 
In 2021, President Joe Biden restored the monuments to their original sizes, a decision Utah is challenging in court.
Meanwhile, polling indicates that 71% of voters favor maintaining Bears Ears as a national monument, while 74% support keeping Grand Staircase-Escalante as a national monument.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-05-14 19:58:12+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,"Budget experts tell lawmakers revenue projections are up, but there’s no windfall",Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/05/14/budget-experts-tell-lawmakers-revenue-projections-are-up-but-theres-no-windfall/,"Officials project the state will collect $57.1B in the fiscal year that begins July 1, a nominal increase from past forecasts.","Treasurer Liz Muoio told lawmakers Wednesday that the state is entering the new fiscal year ""with a solid foundation while keeping an eye on national and international economic developments."" (OIT/NJ Governor’s Office)The state’s fiscal forecasters nudged up revenue projections for the current and coming fiscal year after receiving April tax filings, but the minor shifts reflect predictions of slow growth and broad uncertainty over the future of federal funding.
Officials with the Treasury and the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services both projected New Jersey would bring in $57.1 billion in the fiscal year that begins July 1, up from the $56.8 billion forecast by the Treasury in early April and roughly in line with the legislative office’s prior estimates. Gov. Phil Murphy’s proposed budget calls for about $58.4 billion in spending for the next fiscal year.
Treasurer Liz Muoio told the Assembly’s budget committee Wednesday that the positives of the spring filing season outweigh the negatives.
“We will enter the new fiscal year with a solid foundation while keeping an eye on national and international economic developments,” Muoio said. “As you are all aware, we continue to face massive budgetary uncertainty at the federal level.”
Revenue projections for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, rose by similar levels. The Treasury estimates an increase from $54.9 billion to $55.3 billion, and the Office of Legislative Services’ projections increased from $55.3 billion to $55.4 billion.
The increases are too modest to significantly ease fiscal planning in a budget year officials have repeatedly called difficult, though absent later changes to state spending, they will nominally increase state reserves projected for the end of the next fiscal year from $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion.
That level of surplus would again leave New Jersey’s reserves below 12% of spending, which could spell trouble for the nascent tax relief program called Stay NJ, which promises to halve senior citizens’ property tax bills and is set to begin issuing payments in the next fiscal year. Statutory language requires a pause to Stay NJ payments if the state’s surplus dips below 12% of spending, though lawmakers can overwrite that requirement through budget language.
The Treasury has updated costs for certain health care and other programs in Murphy’s budget proposal, nudging them up by a combined $306.8 million.
The state’s deficit — the degree to which spending outpaces revenue — remains a projected $1.2 billion for the next fiscal year.
The boost to Treasury’s current-year revenue projections was attributed largely to strong personal income tax performance in April, particularly on capital gains. Officials cited a 9.9% growth rate for the gross income tax in the current fiscal year but said its growth would moderate to 2.7% in the next.
Muoio said corporate business tax collections were down 18%, year-over-year, with 60% of that decline due to businesses writing off operating losses in line with a 2023 law changing how business income is calculated for tax purposes.
Those declines should taper off in future years, but were expected to reduce collections under the state’s corporate transit fee from $867.5 million to about $814 million in the next fiscal year. Save a 6% constitutional dedication for open space, revenue from the corporate transit fee in future fiscal years is required by law to flow to NJ Transit.
Officials predicted slow growth for New Jersey’s existing revenue sources. The Office of Legislative Services’ projections say existing revenue would increase by only 1.1% in the coming fiscal year, though tax and fee increases proposed by Murphy would bring overall growth to roughly 3.4%.
“Achieving even this modest growth depends on the continued strength of the state’s consumer spending and employment, which thus far have remained resilient. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that downside risks remain,” said Oscar Mendez, revenue and economic policy analyst at the Office of Legislative Service.
Legislators, including top members on budget committees, have expressed resistance to the proposed tax hikes, which include an expansion of the sales tax to include services at recreational businesses, higher taxes on casinos’ gambling winnings, and larger surcharges on the sale of expensive homes, among other things.
“I want to make it clear to everybody who’s listening to this. There’s no desire from this Legislature to tax those services,” Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate’s budget chair, said at an April hearing. “I think they were a talking point by the governor. I think the governor realizes those will be eliminated.”
Persistent uncertainty about the future of New Jersey’s federal funding amid broad, unpredictable shifts in federal policy left considerable flex in the state’s revenue projections.
New Jersey was set to receive $26.2 billion in federal funding for the next fiscal year, and it’s unclear how congressional Republicans’ proposal to cut more than $818 billion from Medicaid and other programs will affect New Jersey’s federal funds.
Thomas Koenig, the legislative budget and finance officer at the Office of Legislative Services, said things could turn out well, but he added, “We are concerned there is a larger than usual downside risk to our forecast.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-14 19:55:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT Senate passes municipal camp bill following emotional debate,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/14/ct-municipal-camp-licensing-bill-debate/,The bill to require state licensure of municipal camps passed despite concerns it could unintentionally shutter low-cost child care options.,"After hours of debate, much of it emotional and personal, the Connecticut Senate passed a bill on Tuesday that would require municipal camps to be licensed by the state, despite pushback from some lawmakers who said the legislation could unintentionally shutter low-cost child care options that many parents rely on in the summer.
Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton, was among the vocal critics during Tuesday’s debate of Senate Bill 6, an omnibus bill that also focuses on reporting on disconnected youth and healthy meal programs for children. He repeatedly urged his fellow senators to revisit the camp licensure requirement.
“I think we run the risk of harming these children who we attempt to affect positively,” Perillo said. “I think this may be an unintended consequence, whereby our municipal day camps are forced to close because of the costs related to implementation of the bill that is here before us.”
The bill now heads to the House.
Currently, Connecticut summer camps operate with no oversight from the state. Though many say their internal standards are high, there are no state requirements to  comply with basic safety measures like background checks, staff to camper ratios or water testing. 
Municipal camps have voiced opposition to the bill, many saying that the fine print in the bill, like a concern that Perillo raised about the ratio of people to bathrooms, would require costly infrastructure updates.
Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, co-chair of the Committee on Children, has argued that concerns about cost increases are overblown, and that leaving a loophole open that allows camps to operate without oversight has a disproportionate impact on low-income families that can’t afford private camps.
“We know that for many, many low income families, summer camps, municipal camps, are in essence child care,” Maher said. “It is an equity issue that we must oversee municipal camps to make sure they are safe and licensed at the same level as private camps are.”
Under the bill, the new provisions would take a year to go into effect. Maher said that would give the state enough time to work out cost issues that arise. 
Legislators have attempted for years to subject municipal camps to more oversight, but the issue has gotten more traction this year in light of a child sex assault case at a town-run camp in Bethany that came to public attention last year. In that case, a counselor was accused by several girls of sexual abuse at camps. But on Tuesday, Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, argued the new requirements would not have prevented a similar case because the counselor in that case had been subjected to a background check.
“All of these new provisions that have been put in this bill, they would not have made one difference in what happened in Bethany,” Somers said, as she pressed for an amendment that would have taken the licensure requirements out of the bill. That amendment failed. 
Sen. Catherine Osten, D-Sprague and co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, spoke on the Senate floor about the bill, saying she had “a story to tell.” Speaking at length, Osten described the struggles her family went through after her daughter was molested by a relative’s boyfriend. Osten said that went on for about a year until her daughter said something was happening.
Osten said she spent years trying to prevent other families from going through the same thing, and while she empathized with the families in Bethany that were affected by the alleged abuse, she argued that such a bill wouldn’t stop other perpetrators from hurting kids in the future. Instead, Osten said, the bill would negatively impact families because it would cause camps to shutter, leaving children without a place to go. 
“There’s nothing to take away the pain. There’s not a thing we can do to take away the pain in something like this,” Osten said. “I think it’s a great thing that you want to feel better, but I can tell you that you are not going to protect children with a piece of legislation that will not stop someone from putting hands on children. The only thing that stops people from putting hands on children is to put them in jail, to incarcerate those people, to make sure they stay there a really long time. And when they get out to follow them and make sure they get the treatment they can. And our bills today don’t address that issue.” 
Sen. Mae Flexer, D-Killingly, told her fellow lawmakers that some parts of Tuesday’s debate were frustrating. 
“I think it’s actually an example of the Connecticut legislature listening to parents,” she said. She said that parents make choices about camps based on cost, while assuming that all camps meet the same safety standards. “While what happened in Bethany is not the only reason for this legislation before us, it should be the driving reason why we finally close this loophole.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_1001_SR_Bethany_015-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)This story first appeared on the Rhode Island Current.
There’s no reason why money for road repairs and flood protections should hinge upon states’ cooperation with federal immigration policies, contend 20 Democratic states attorneys general.
That’s why the AGs are asking a federal judge to stop federal agencies from a “grant funding hostage scheme” that requires detaining undocumented immigrants who don’t commit crimes in order to receive key federal grants and aid.
Two new federal lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) aim to protect and preserve billions of federal dollars already awarded to states for emergency preparedness, disaster relief and infrastructure projects.
Directives issued in April by DHS and DOT secretaries informed states that their federal funding required compliance with federal immigration policies. The AGs — representing Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont — allege this violated constitutional protections for separation of powers.
“By hanging a halt in this critical funding over States like a sword of Damocles, Defendants impose immense harm on States, forcing them to choose between readiness for disasters and emergencies, on the one hand, and their judgment about how best to investigate and prosecute crimes, on the other,” the lawsuit against DHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Coast Guard, and their leaders, states.
“Defendants’ grant funding hostage scheme violates two key principles that underlie the American system of checks and balances: agencies in the Executive Branch cannot act contrary to the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government cannot use the spending power to coerce States into adopting its preferred policies. Defendants have ignored both principles, claiming undelegated power to place their own conditions on dozens of grant programs that Congress created and bulldozing through the Constitution’s boundary between state and federal authority.”
The AGs say state and local public safety officials have more important work to do than cater to the whims of a new administration, which stand in contradiction to state-level directives like, for example, authorizing licenses for undocumented immigrants. Rhode Island lawmakers granted driving privileges for undocumented residents in 2022, with a July, 1 2023 effective date, joining 19 other states and D.C.
Federal protocols followed by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies could force state and local police to use state license laws as a way to find and detain undocumented immigrants.
“As a former U.S. Attorney and former federal prosecutor, I know how many ICE agents are in Rhode Island and it’s under 10,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, said during a virtual news conference Tuesday. “What they need in order to carry out their agenda is for us to do the work for them, pulling us away from important law enforcement work in Rhode Island.”
No state has seen federal funding cut off since directives were issued by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Not yet.
States’ abilities to respond to natural disasters and security threats, and complete key infrastructure projects, including the much-anticipated rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge in Rhode Island, hinge upon a continued flow of congressionally authorized federal grants and aid.
The $221 million Biden-era infrastructure grant awarded to Rhode Island for the Washington Bridge project only became accessible in late March, after weeks of uncertainty in the wake of the administration change. Gov. Dan McKee’s office and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday regarding continued access to the funds in the wake of Duffy’s April 24 directive tying federal infrastructure grants to compliance with federal diversity and immigration policies.
The Duffy directive fails to provide any statutory or legal explanation for why transportation funding relates to immigration enforcement. The new requirements  jeopardize more than $628 million in federal funding in Rhode Island, and billions of dollars more across the country, the AGs argue in their lawsuit against Duffy and DOT.
“If Plaintiff States reject Defendants’ unlawful Immigration Enforcement Condition, they will collectively lose billions in federal funding that is essential to sustain critical public safety and transportation programs, including highway development, airport safety projects, protections against train collisions, and programs to prevent injuries and deaths from traffic accidents. The loss of this funding will cause state and local providers to scale back or even terminate many of these programs and projects,” the complaint states. “More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States.”


Similarly dire predictions accompany the loss of security and disaster funds, which includes $3 billion in FEMA money to states each year, according to the lawsuit against DHS. Rhode Island received more than $45 million in FEMA grants in 2024 alone, according to the lawsuit.


The new complaints reprise language of the 20 state AG lawsuits against the Trump administration that preceded them, calling the executive agencies’ actions “arbitrary and capricious” and in clear violation of constitutional separation of powers and spending clauses.
Neronha during the press conference pointed to the success that AGs have had in other lawsuits, temporarily preserving funding and policy protections for education, immigration, research funding, public health, and grants and aid to state governments, among others.
Not that he expects the frenzy of legal activity will abate anytime soon.
“As we stack wins against the Trump administration for violation of the Constitution and other federal laws, what we are seeing is a creeping authoritarianism in this country,” Neronha said. “The president is trying to take power for himself. He’s trying to sideline Congress, and now, he’s attempting to undermine the judiciary.”
Neronha likened the latest federal directives attempting to force states to redirect their own law enforcement to serve federal civil immigration policies to “holding a gun to states’ heads.”
Rhode Island, home to four of the 20 federal lawsuits against the Trump administration already, was again picked as the setting for the latest complaints due to the “strong team” within Neronha’s office, he said.
Neronha and other AGs bringing the two cases against the administration also stressed the sum of their collaborative parts.
“We’ve built the best and biggest law firm in the country, and we’re fighting for all Americans,” Neronha said.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
The lawsuit against DOT was assigned to U.S. District Chief Judge John Jr. McConnell Jr., while the case against DHS was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith, according to the public court docket.

“There’s no question of Rep. Bolton’s good intentions, but to say his bill was complicated is being just a little bit kind,” Clay Redden, the House public information officer, said as he read a resolution presenting the Shroud. “Representative Bolton’s bill read like chapters from a pediatrician’s anatomy book or an instruction manual and manual of how to operate a nuclear reactor.”
The bill failed a procedural motion known as a budget isolation resolution (BIR) on Feb. 27 amid pushback from both Democrats and Republicans. 
“And let’s not forget what Rep. Marcus Paramore pointed out just before the BIR failed, this bill would have made it nearly impossible for him, Rep. Leigh Hulsey and Rep. Susan DuBose to drive themselves to work,” Redden read from the resolution Wednesday.

The Raising Voices Lab is a new desk at CT Mirror that will take a different approach to meeting information needs and distributing reporting to readers. It will be spearheaded by two community engagement reporters — one based in Bridgeport and one in Hartford — who will form relationships in their cities and crowdsource questions on anything from home ownership to Medicaid to city happenings. 
The reporters will research the answers to those questions, then push that information out via text, social media and events. They will also write about what’s working in their communities, which too often only make the news when something negative happens. And they’ll bring learnings and story tips from conversations with community members back to the rest of CT Mirror’s staff to inform other reporting as well.
The goal of the Raising Voices Lab is to understand and meet the information needs of communities of color and to shine a light on stories that have historically been absent from dominant narratives about underrepresented communities.
“Making the connection between public policy and its impact on underserved communities — particularly communities of color — has long been a priority for The Connecticut Mirror, but this initiative gives us an opportunity to take that work a step further,” said CT Mirror Executive Editor Elizabeth Hamilton. “By centering the voices of residents, we hope to discover and address information gaps in these communities and provide useful tools for people to participate in solutions. We are honored to have the opportunity to work in these communities and eager to begin the listening that is at the heart of service journalism.”
CT Mirror has hired a community engagement reporter for Bridgeport and will announce the reporter serving Hartford in the coming weeks.
Bridgeport
Bridgeport native Reginald David will serve as the city’s community engagement reporter. David previously served as a producer at KCUR 89.3, Kansas City’s NPR station, where he created community-centered programming, led live event coverage for major events, and launched KC Soundcheck, a music series spotlighting local and national artists.
David has also hosted special segments, including an in-depth interview with civil rights leader Alvin Brooks and live community coverage on issues like racial segregation and neighborhood development.
A graduate of Avila University in Kansas City, he began his journalism career as an “Integrity in News” intern at WNPR in Hartford.
His first day at CT Mirror was Monday.
“We’re excited to have Reginald join CT Mirror to report on Connecticut’s largest city,” said Enterprise Editor Keila Torres Ocasio. “His knowledge of Bridgeport, coupled with his experience in community-based reporting in Kansas City, gives him a unique perspective. His goal will be to give readers in the city information that is relevant to them and readers outside the city a new reason to care about what’s happening in the Park City.”
CT Mirror’s Manager of Membership Irene Mackey chatted with David about his plans for his new role. Their conversation is below:
CT Mirror: What drew you to CT Mirror and the role of Community Engagement Reporter?
Reginald: CT Mirror’s focus on policy and accountability journalism stood out to me. I’ve found the reporting to be thoughtful and impactful. I was especially drawn to the Raising Voices Lab because I’ve always cared about uplifting underrepresented communities. This role feels like a natural next step in my work connecting stories to the people they impact.
CT Mirror: This role centers on the city of Bridgeport. How do you plan to build trust and connect with people who may not see themselves reflected in traditional media?
Reginald: I plan to show up consistently, not just when there’s a story. Whether it’s chatting at local businesses or attending events, I’ll be present, listening, and transparent about what I’m doing. I want people to see me as a neighbor, not just a reporter.
CT Mirror: Community-focused journalism often blends reporting with resource-sharing. How do you plan to decide whether a story needs to inform, explain, or guide someone to take action?
Reginald: I’ll listen to what people are asking. If there’s confusion, I’ll explain. If they’re looking for help, I’ll guide. If it’s something they’ve never heard about, I’ll inform. My goal is to make sure stories are useful and accessible.
CT Mirror: CT Mirror has a focus on state policy. How do you envision connecting local questions, like neighborhood development or access to services, to broader systems or statewide decisions?
Reginald: Most local issues are tied to bigger systems, going from housing to education. I want to show how Bridgeport residents are affected by statewide policies and focus on the connections between what’s happening in their neighborhood and what’s being decided in their city and community.
CT Mirror: Is there a local Bridgeport spot you love to visit, or something new you’re hoping to discover about the city?
Reginald: I love the beach, so being able to continue to visit all the beaches in the area is both a pleasure and a goal of mine. I’m also excited to keep exploring Bridgeport’s food spots and meet more of the people who make the city what it is.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cropped-DavidHeadshot.jpg,,,2025-05-14 16:10:41.002662

Republicans rejected numerous amendments offered by Democrats, including protecting tax credits meant to combat climate change enacted under Democrats’ own 2022 budget reconciliation law, the Inflation Reduction Act.The marathon debate occurred as the House Committee on Energy and Commerce debated overnight and into Wednesday afternoon over deep budget cuts, including some to Medicaid assistance for low-income individuals, to pay for the cost of tax provisions.As of now, the massive tax package is estimated to add $3.8 trillion to the budget deficit over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.If any temporary expansions in the bill are eventually made permanent, it would add roughly $5.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the CRFB. The official congressional budget score has not yet been released.Overall the bill is “a very, very big tax cut,” said Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, part of the left-leaning Brookings Institution and Urban Institute. “Much of the benefit will go to higher income people.”Tax brackets, business breaks would continueThe bill permanently extends the underlying tax provisions passed in 2017 under the GOP-backed bill titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is set to expire in 2025.This means:Individual taxpayers would remain in the same tax brackets that were lowered in 2017, and they would continue to see the doubled standard deduction — two of the most costly measures. Additionally, taxpayers will receive a boost up to $2,000 on the standard deduction through 2028.Individual brackets would remain at 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%, though the proposal would change how inflation adjustments are calculated, meaning income would be taxed less over time, except for those in the 37% bracket.The $2,000 child tax credit, per child, would remain permanent but temporarily increase to $2,500 through 2028. The refundable portion of the credit — meaning how much money taxpayers can get back — would be increased to $1,400, but the amount remains subject to income thresholds, meaning lower income households would receive less of a refund.The child tax credit would now only be accessible if the parent submits a Social Security number, as well as a spouse’s if legally married, in addition to the already required Social Security number of each qualifying child.On the business side, the corporate tax rate would stay at 21%.Business owners who run sole proprietorships, partnerships and S-corporations would see an increase, to 23% up from 20%, in the amount of business income they can deduct from their federal returns, otherwise referred to as the pass-through income deduction.Expensing for research and development would be restored through 2029, as well as deductions available to businesses for certain investments, including equipment purchases.No tax on tips, but only for a few yearsTrump promised on the campaign trail to eliminate taxes on tips, Social Security and car loan interest. House Republicans handed him a win in their bill, but only a limited one.The bill allows individual taxpayers to deduct qualifying tips earned throughout the year, a tax break that would end in 2028. And like the new child tax credit requirement, taxpayers could only take advantage of the deduction by including a Social Security number on their federal tax return as well as their spouse’s SSN, if married.No taxes on car loan interest would also go into effect through 2028, though taxpayers could only claim it for automobiles that received final assembly in the United States.Senior citizens with incomes of $75,000 or less, or $150,000 for a married couple, would receive an extra $4,000 discount on taxable income, with the amount decreasing as incomes increase. The tax break would also expire in 2028. The bill does not specify an age for “seniors.”Highly taxed states still unhappy House Republicans raised the cap on the amount of state and local taxes, or SALT, that can be deducted, but not enough to please both GOP and Democratic lawmakers who represent highly taxed states like New York and California.Under the bill the committee advanced Wednesday morning, taxpayers could deduct up to $30,000 — three times the $10,000 ceiling in the 2017 law — from their federal taxable income. The full cap would apply to those making $400,000 or less in annual income but phases down for higher earners.Raising the cap is costly and unpopular with lawmakers representing lower tax states.Republican Reps. Mike Lawler and Nick LaLota of New York, and Rep. Young Kim of California, are threatening to vote no on the House floor if the cap isn’t raised. The House GOP cannot lose more than a handful of votes if all Republicans are present.House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana told reporters Wednesday he didn’t want to “handicap” negotiations by sharing details publicly and that he was talking to the SALT caucus until 1:30 a.m.“But I will tell you I'm absolutely confident we're going to be able to work out a compromise that everybody can live with,” he said.A ‘tragic indifference’ for poor familiesThe committee’s party-line approval of the bill drew praise and criticism across organizations representing varying interests of Americans.Kris Cox, director of federal tax policy for the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote on social media that the temporary child tax credit bump does “zilch” for the roughly 17 million children whose parents do not earn enough money to receive a refund check from the credit.“But it delivers an additional $500-per-kid to higher-income families,” Cox wrote.The organization also slammed the bill for going “out of its way to take eligibility from 4.5 million US citizen kids who have at least one parent without an SSN.”Kristen Crowell, executive director of the advocacy group Fair Share America, said in a statement Wednesday that the bill “shows a tragic indifference to the very real struggles of normal, working people.“In order to save face in front of their constituents, Republicans are hiding behind misleading claims that everyone will see reductions in their taxes,” Crowell said.The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental protection advocacy organization, estimates that phasing out and altogether eliminating clean energy tax credits would result in higher electricity bills in several states, including Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to an emailed statement.‘Unshackle the economy’ for businessesGroups representing businesses across the U.S. praised the House bill as a way to bolster investment and growth opportunities.Former Republican Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady of Texas released a statement Wednesday on behalf of the Alliance for Competitive Taxation praising the bill as a path to “unshackle the economy from burdensome taxes and unlock new growth.”“The bill reported out by the House Ways and Means Committee is an encouraging step in that direction and, if implemented with its major pro-growth proposals intact, will help American businesses and workers compete at home and abroad,” Brady said.The alliance hailed the extension of the 21% corporate tax rate and urged lawmakers to make permanent the research and development expensing, and capital investment deductions.Kristen Silverberg, president and chief operating officer of the Business Roundtable, said her organization “applauds Chairman Smith and members of the House Ways and Means Committee for advancing a comprehensive, pro-growth tax bill,” referring to GOP Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri.“Today’s vote is a critical step forward in securing a more competitive tax system for American businesses and workers,” said Silverberg, whose organization represents 200 CEOs of U.S.-based companies.",,,,2025-05-14 16:10:41.002662

(Photo by Namthip Muanthongthae/Getty Images)A bill that has passed the New Hampshire House of Representatives and is set to be voted on by the state Senate Thursday would tie the hands of anyone trying to regulate cryptocurrency mining — a move heralded by libertarians and the crypto lobby but decried by environmentalists.
When introducing the bill, Rep. Keith Ammon, a New Boston Republican and the bill’s sponsor, said it would “give confidence to the industry that we’re not going to discriminate against them because it’s happened in other states.” Ammon pointed to North Tonawanda, New York, which The Buffalo News reported in 2024 banned crypto mining for energy and noise concerns.
If enacted, House Bill 639 would forbid state agencies and local officials from regulating cryptocurrency mining. It enshrines into law a protection for people to conduct in-home cryptocurrency mining. State agencies and local officials would be unable to ban cryptocurrency mining in their city, town, or elsewhere in the state under this bill. They would be unable to place sound limits on cryptocurrency mining, though miners would have to obey other sound ordinances. They also wouldn’t be able to charge cryptocurrency miners additional money for any outsized impact they have on the electric grid. Finally, they’d be unable to prevent people from using cryptocurrency to buy or sell things.
Cryptocurrency mining is the process of generating cryptocurrencies — which are digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin — using high-energy supercomputers. The computers essentially use trial and error until they’ve guessed the solution to a puzzle that unlocks the cryptocurrency from what is known as a blockchain. These virtual assets are often bought and sold for U.S. dollars or other currencies, making mining lucrative. Proponents of crypto hope it will one day be used as a regular currency, and some buyers and sellers have already adopted it as such.
“The benefit for projecting that we’re friendly to mining is that it can help incentivize future generations,” Ammon said at a recent Senate hearing. “We want to get out of this scarcity mindset that there’s only a fixed pie of so much energy to go around.” 
Ammon — who said he owns digital assets himself and is the chair of the nonprofit New Hampshire Blockchain Council — dismissed environmental concerns about cryptocurrency’s effect on the planet and electric grids.
“There’s some folks that believe Bitcoin mining is gonna raise the oceans, we’re all gonna drown, or we’re gonna boil the seas or something like that,” he said. “All this section does is prevent municipalities from discriminating against the energy use.”
Ammon said this bill is based on the work of the Commission on Cryptocurrencies and Digital Assets, which was established by former Gov. Chris Sununu to study regulations for these digital assets, as well as model legislation circulating in other states. That model legislation was created by a Mississippi-based industry group called Satoshi Action Fund. The group seeks to promote cryptocurrency nationwide and boasts on its website that its policies have been implemented in four states: Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, and Oklahoma. The Satoshi Action Fund was also a consultant to the governor’s cryptocurrency commission.
The bill also specifies that cryptocurrency mining and other operations are not considered securities or investment contracts. This has sparked concerns among regulators, including Katie Taylor, with the state Bureau of Securities Regulation, who said in a Senate hearing, “It would prohibit the bureau’s ability to protect New Hampshire investors.”
The bill has also drawn the attention of environmentalists in New Hampshire and elsewhere.
“What this bill says is shocking,” Cathy Corkery, chapter director of the New Hampshire Sierra Club, said. “It devalues and demotes communities from being able to zone and govern the enterprises within its own borders.”
Corkery and her colleagues have several gripes with cryptocurrency mining. First, it’s loud and usually runs 24/7, which in other communities has drawn intense ire from neighbors. It’s highly energy intensive, so it causes carbon emissions and could become a strain on the electric grid. (Analysis from a Dutch doctoral student found that, as of May 2025, the electrical energy consumption of a single Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to that of an average U.S. household over 45.60 days.) And many operations use lots of water to cool down their equipment. (Another analysis from the same researcher found that an average Bitcoin transaction uses enough water to fill a small backyard swimming pool.) They’re afraid this will raise utility bills and the hot water the facilities expel will hurt wildlife.
“The reality is that this isn’t just some guy with a computer,” she said. “These are supercomputers that suck up a lot of energy.”
Corkery is concerned how this will impact climate change, the state’s electrical grid, and quiet communities unaccustomed to loud industrial noise. Most of all, she dislikes how it hinders local government oversight.
“It takes away a town’s sovereignty,” she said. “And it says you must allow this in your town.”
Corkery said she’d heard about this legislation in other states from her national partners and so “had sort of an understanding of the experiences in other communities that had accepted this bill” before it came to New Hampshire. As such, the Granite State has garnered attention from people who have been fighting Satoshi Action Fund-endorsed legislation elsewhere. 
Cyndie Roberson, a founding member of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining, called New Hampshire’s HB 639 “a boilerplate piece of legislation written by one of crypto mining’s biggest lobbying firms” and said Satoshi Action Fund “shoot(s) this legislation out shotgun approach across states.” She pointed to Arkansas, where Satoshi Action Fund was successful in enacting the policies, as “a cautionary tale.”
When Arkansas enacted the Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023 and a slew of crypto mines came to the state, it was met by intense uproar, Little Rock Public Radio reported. In an interview with CBS News, Gladys Anderson, who lived near a cryptocurrency mine in Bono, Arkansas, described the 24/7 sound of roughly 17,000 computer fans running in the mine “like a form of military-grade torture.” In 2024, responding to the blowback, a bipartisan group of Arkansas lawmakers approved legislation to reverse the unconditional protections miners had from local government regulation. However, a federal judge ordered the state to pause that legislation because a provision of the bill bans foreign ownership of crypto mines (legislators were also worried about mines’ potential ties to China), which may violate the 14th Amendment.
“My cautionary tale to legislators in New Hampshire who feel pressured to do this, it’s a very hard bell to unring,” Roberson said. “Once they pass this and it’s a done deal, it’s very difficult to get parts of it changed or repealed once it’s in place.”
Satoshi Action Fund did not respond to the Bulletin’s request for comment and an interview.
Corkery, with the Sierra Club, called Ammon’s worries about cryptocurrency miners being discriminated against “a farce.”
“He has no examples of it being discriminated against in New Hampshire,” she said. “He characterizes this bill as a welcome sign for the cryptocurrency industry. This is not a welcome sign. This is a come-plow-through-our-state flag.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cryptocurrency-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 16:10:41.002662
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-14 19:39:06+00:00,CT Mirror,Proposal seeking to punish CT companies that aid in death penalty moves forward,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/14/ct-companies-death-penalty-executions-bill/,The legislation would penalize companies that manufacture or sell drugs or devices that can be used in capital punishment.,"The legislature’s Judiciary Committee voted Monday to advance a proposal that would penalize companies that manufacture and sell drugs or devices that can be used in capital punishment. 
The legislation initially emerged in response to an episode of John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight” in April 2024, in which Oliver said he was “pretty sure” that the Hamden-based company Absolute Standards Inc. had provided phenobarbital, a lethal injection drug used in federal executions. 
The proposal had a public hearing in February, but was never voted out of committee. Instead, its provisions were incorporated into a separate bill — dealing with importing and compounding drugs used in medically-induced abortions — which the Judiciary Committee heard Monday. 
Under the proposal, the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Protection can refuse to issue a certificate of registration to a business that manufactures or sells items the business knows will be used to “execute a sentence of death.” The department can also suspend or revoke a registration that already exists. 
On Monday, Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, raised oppositions to the bill, pointing out that while capital punishment was illegal in Connecticut, it still takes place in other U.S. states. He proposed an amendment that would eliminate certain sections of the bill. 
“I, first of all, felt that that was wrong — to try to impose our position regarding the death penalty in other states by means of restricting the lawful sale of an item by a business in Connecticut,” Kissel said. 
Kissel also questioned whether the proposal might violate an interpretation of the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, known as the Dormant Commerce Clause. He cited the 1978 case Philadelphia v. New Jersey, which ruled that the state of New Jersey could not refuse to import waste from Philadelphia because it would “discriminate” economically against imports from another state. 
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, agreed with Kissel, noting that the Dormant Commerce Clause prevents individual states from taking action that would interfere with trade taking place across state lines. 
“In a nutshell, the proposed legislation, should it pass, is ripe for a likely successful [legal] challenge, and it would be irresponsible for the legislature to set the state on that path,” Fishbein said in an email.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, said he felt the bill deserved to be debated more broadly, on the floor of the Senate, and that he feared that amending the bill “would effectively kill it” because of how little time they had left before the legislative session ends. 
Winfield told the Connecticut Mirror that he hadn’t yet looked into the case Kissel cited, but he said he believed the circumstances of the case were different. He said while he did not want to see Connecticut export lethal drugs to other states, lawmakers needed to consider whether Kissel’s concern was legitimate.  
The bill passed through the Judiciary Committee with a vote of 28-13. 
Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, one of the sponsors of the initial legislation prohibiting the manufacture of these drugs and devices, told CT Mirror on Tuesday that he felt it was important to pass the legislation this year because of the Trump administration’s support for the death penalty. 
“We can really sort of pave the way for other states to do the same thing,” Elliott said. “By limiting the market, we make it more likely that less lethal injection will happen across the U.S.”
Absolute Standards has since ceased manufacturing phenobarbital, according to a letter that company president John Criscio wrote to Connecticut lawmakers last year. 
Along with Absolute Standards, a subsidiary of the company Walter Surface Technologies, which has its U.S. headquarters in Windsor, reportedly manufactures respirator safety masks used during executions in Alabama. Elliott said he’s not aware of any other companies in Connecticut manufacturing materials used in capital punishment. 
During the February public hearing, Elliott’s bill received some opposition from disability rights advocates and the CT Catholic Public Affairs Conference, who protested that the bill penalized companies for aiding in capital punishment but not companies or individuals who provided drugs to aid in assisted suicide or euthanasia.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Matthew Mueller)Daniel Cameron, a former Republican Kentucky attorney general who is seeking election to the U.S. Senate, criticized the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission Wednesday over what he called “a bogus charge of violating state ethics law.” 
In a news release, Cameron’s campaign says the commission has charged him with an ethics violation stemming from donations collected by his 2023 campaign for governor. 
In June 2023, the AFL-CIO filed a complaint with the commission seeking an investigation of allegations that Cameron had solicited executives of Edgewater Recovery Center while his attorney general’s office was investigating the organization. 
At the time, Cameron’s gubernatorial campaign said it had refunded the donations and canceled a fundraiser Edgewater had planned to hold for Cameron after becoming aware of a possible conflict of interest.
On Wednesday, Cameron’s Senate campaign issued additional details aimed at refuting any allegation that he used his influence as AG by failing to recuse himself and his office from the Edgewater matter.
According to a 2023 report from the Daily Beast, Cameron recused himself from the Edgewater investigation two days after his office received an open records request for Cameron’s recusals.
Cameron, who lost the 2023 race to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, chalked up the charge to the work of a “Democrat-controlled Executive Branch Ethics Commission.” In a statement he called it “political persecution.” Cameron also shared a video on X about the charge and said the commission was “weaponizing government to attack a political opponent.”
Cameron said he’d never run “from tough fights. Not when angry mobs protested on my front lawn. And certainly not when the left tried to strip away your constitutional rights.”
“I’m going to fight this just like I’ll continue fighting for the great people of this Commonwealth. Every single day,” he continued.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A federal judge on Tuesday granted a preliminary injunction preventing the federal government from revoking the visa status of two Montana State University graduate students and prohibiting the federal government from arresting, detaining or transferring either student from Montana. 
In April, four international students affiliated with the Montana University System had their visas revoked and student visitor records terminated.
Due to the possibility of immediate deportation due to the change in status, two of the students challenged the decision in federal court.
The ACLU of Montana sued on their behalf, and the Trump administration subsequently and separately reinstated them in a database that keeps those records, the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS.
However, Alex Rate with the ACLU of Montana previously told the Daily Montanan continuing the lawsuit would ensure the students have ongoing assurance their status would not change again without cause. 
U.S. District Court Judge Dana L. Christensen previously granted an emergency restraining order preventing the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting the students, and Tuesday’s 26-page ruling converts that restraining order into a preliminary injunction, reinstating their legal status for the duration of the lawsuit. 
“The court made it clear that the Trump administration cannot unilaterally circumvent the law and punish students who have followed all the rules by stripping them of their legal status, disrupting their studies, and putting them at risk of deportation,” said Akilah Deernose, Executive Director of the ACLU of Montana, in a press statement. “We are pleased that the Court granted a preliminary injunction to provide longer-term certainty and to preserve the status quo until the lawsuit is resolved. Now our clients have the assurance they need to continue their graduate studies, especially given the unpredictable actions undertaken by the Trump administration.” 
On April 25, the Department of Homeland Security reversed a policy that had resulted in the mass termination of international students’ SEVIS records, but the court found in its ruling that because defendants could not provide “any information — let alone any specific information or timelines” about the new policy, a preliminary injunction was warranted. 
“At risk of understandment, the defendants’ approach to these particular issues presents an ever-changing landscape,” according to court documents. Without more information or a guarantee of the plaintiffs’ status, “The changes wrought by defendants appear to fall squarely within the category of ‘easily abandoned or altered in the future.”
 The court’s ruling also found that the Trump administration failed to follow its own agency’s regulation in terminating the SEVIS records, saying the action was “arbitrary and capricious.” 
According to court documents, the federal government argued that the students’ records were terminated “due to their criminal history,” but neither student has been convicted of a crime. 
One student was arrested in March and charged with misdemeanor theft, but pleaded not guilty and has not been convicted of any offense. 
The other student had been arrested and charged with misdemeanor partner and/or family member assault but also pleaded not guilty and has not been convicted of any offense. 
The Department of Homeland Security cited a regulation that says criminal activity could result in termination of status as justification for their actions, but the court found that the regulation specifically states that a “conviction” for “a crime of violence for which more than one year imprisonment may be imposed [] constitutes a failure to maintain status.”
The charges against the plaintiffs don’t satisfy the criteria, the ruling states, due to one carrying a maximum sentence of less than one year of imprisonment, the other carrying no prison time, and neither plaintiff has been convicted. 
As a result of the injunction, both students have been able to return to work and school, according to the ACLU press release. 
The students — one pursuing a doctorate in electrical engineering and physics and the other a master’s degree in microbiology — are both “only a matter of months away from obtaining their advanced degrees.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_5790-1024x855.jpg,,,2025-05-14 16:10:41.002662

Critics of the bill who debated against its passage previously said the measure claws back at advancements in civil rights and inclusion. Democrats debating against the bill said they were worried the ban would bleed into other inclusion programs like Oklahoma Promise and affect access to students with disabilities. 
Supporters said that DEI discriminates against white men and merit-based outcomes. 
The ban also prevents schools from requiring people to adhere to specific viewpoints or favor a particular religion, race or sex. 
Debating in favor of her bill on May 6, Rep. Denise Crosswhite Hader, R-Piedmont, said students have been forced to take courses irrelevant to their degree because of DEI, extending the time and money spent on a degree. She did not provide an example.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A new “One Big Beautiful Bill” unveiled Wednesday will be the last train out of Nebraska’s 2025 legislative session for additional property tax relief this year.
The new amendment to Legislative Bill 170, led by State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, would inject an additional $100 million each year into property tax relief, which would come at the cost of sales taxes being added to 20 currently exempt goods and services, effective Oct. 1, and increasing nicotine-based taxes on vapes (by 30%) and cigarettes (by 72 cents), effective July 1.
Proposed targets for expanded sales taxes range from animal grooming and dating services to lobbying and chartered flights, as well as soft drinks and energy drinks.
Supporters have dubbed the LB 170 package as “One Big Beautiful Bill” in a nod to a federal spending package working its way through Congress with President Donald Trump’s support.
“It’s why I came here,” State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, who worked with Brandt on the package, said of property tax relief. “It’s all I heard about.”


Estimated new tax revenue under LB 170 package

$42 million — 72-cent increase on cigarette taxes, up to $1.36.
$28 million — sales taxes on 18 currently exempt “optional” goods or services.
$25 million — sales taxes on soft drinks and energy drinks.
$15 million — increasing vape taxes from 10% to 40% wholesale.



The only viable path to additional property tax relief this year requires the proposed revenue streams in LB 170, because lawmakers advanced, and will more than likely pass Thursday, budget bills leaving about $1.1 million to spend on other priorities.
That calculation includes proposed 1.5% increases to judges’ salaries each of the next two years that lawmakers have signaled they intend to pass.
Brandt said he was pleased to get through the budget “in pretty good shape” and praised the Appropriations Committee for its work. 
“Now we can go back to working on broadening Nebraska’s tax base,” Brandt said.
A similar property tax relief plan failed throughout 2024, including during the summer special session called by Gov. Jim Pillen focused on property taxes.
Opponents, including progressives and some conservatives, refused to vote for what they saw as a reliance on sales and “sin” taxes that they said would “shift” the burden onto low-income or middle-class working Nebraskans. Scaled-back proposals also failed to gain traction.
New sales taxes
Under Brandt’s proposal, sales taxes would be added to 20 goods and services, as well as to soft drinks and energy drinks, a smaller subset than he previously proposed in LB 169. Taken together, the new sales taxes would generate about $53 million each year ($25 million of which is projected to come from pop or energy drinks alone). The package would not add sales taxes to candy, as had been proposed in LB 170.

“Energy drinks” — carbonated or noncarbonated beverages containing a stimulant such as fortified caffeine, guarana, glucuronolactone or taurine “specifically formulated to enhance energy, alertness or physical performance.”

Brandt said that when he and other lawmakers determined which items to consider adding state and local sales taxes to, at 5.5 cents for the state, plus local taxes of up to 1.5 cents, he said “optional” items were the focus. Lawmakers also tried to tread carefully, he said, on massage, nail care, skin care or tattoo/body modification services that are for medical reasons.
Increased ‘sin’ taxes
Under the amendment to LB 170, taxes on cigarettes would increase from 64 cents per 20-pack to $1.36, the same as Iowa. Estimates that Brandt provided indicate it would generate about $42 million each year.
Lawmakers would distribute about 88% of the tax to the state’s general fund. That’s a greater share than under current law, at about 77% of the tax. Revenue is currently divided among multiple cash funds, including for cancer research, outdoor recreation development and construction.

The package also includes LB 712, from Hughes, to create a uniform 40% tax on electronic nicotine delivery systems, or vapes. It’s estimated to generate about $15 million each year.
The current system, which Hughes established in 2023, taxes vapes containing 3 milliliters or more of consumable nicotine at 10% of wholesale price, or 5 cents per milliliter on smaller devices.
Also included is LB 212, from State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, which aims to close a “loophole” on taxes on cigars, cheroots or stogies purchased online from out-of-state retailers, subjecting those to a 20% excise tax. Estimates that Brandt provided indicate it would generate about $100,000 each year.
Last train out of the station
The property tax relief push might also be paired with tweaks to the 2023-enacted income tax cuts that will drop income tax rates for corporations and anyone making more than $18,000 down to 3.99% by Jan. 1, 2027. Rather than pausing the reductions, as in Brandt’s LB 171, some senators have suggested a longer stair-step down to 3.99%, by 2029 rather than 2027.
Last month, Pillen called pausing the rate reduction a “a crazy thought.” He has vowed to keep property taxes flat and said he was “100% confident” that lawmakers would deliver property tax relief.

A separate tax relief measure at Pillen’s request, LB 303 from Hughes, advanced from the Education Committee last week but has been significantly changed. It no longer includes a highly supported provision to directly lower school property tax rates, which is an alternative to increasing property tax credits to offset school property taxes.
Instead, the measure includes only a committee to review and suggest long-term changes to how the state finances K-12 schools, with property tax relief in mind.
Property taxes in recent years have grown annually by about $285 million. Last year was a noteworthy exception, with the state taking on the property tax portion of funding community colleges. Property taxes declined by $6 million last year off of a $5.3 billion total. 
LB 170 will likely be debated Monday, multiple senators said. That discussion is expected to last eight hours.

Iowa Dental Board records indicate the board recently charged dentist Terra Hickey of Center Point with practicing in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public. Hickey has been an Iowa-licensed dentist since July 2000,
The board alleges Hickey, who works at Center Point Family Dentistry, at some unspecified time in the past failed to recognize tooth decay, failed to complete a thorough removal of decay, failed to properly place restorations, and failed to adequately inform patients of their diagnosis and treatment plans. The board adds that Hickey’s failure to diagnose cavities in multiple patients resulted in tooth extractions.
Board records indicate the investigation of Hickey’s practice was initiated in 2023.
The board recently agreed to resolve the case with a settlement agreement that calls for Hickey to complete a comprehensive remedial education program as well as a board-approved coarse on ethics.
In addition, Hickey’s license will be placed on probation for one year, during which a sampling of Hickey’s work will be reviewed by a dental-practice monitor. Hickey will also be required to pay $1,200 “for probation,” according to the agreement.



Board issues order in patient-death case
The Iowa Dental Board has issued a final order in a disciplinary case involving a dentist accused of contributing to the death of a patient.
An Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing database indicates the board issued the order involving dentist Jonathan Karch two weeks ago on April 30. However, board documents outlining the terms of the final order have yet to be made publicly available, and the board’s website indicates there are no public records of any disciplinary action ever taken against Karch.
Last fall, the board issued an emergency order restricting Karch’s practice after a patient who underwent a dental-implant procedure in January 2024 died. At the time, the board alleged Karch, who worked at the Dental Studio of Iowa in Johnston, did not stay in the operatory for the duration of the procedure, in violation of state regulations.
In issuing the emergency order restricting Karch’s ability to practice, the board said it recognized “(Karch) as an imminent threat to public safety” and stated that he “should not be permitted to participate in procedures involving sedation until further order.”
The emergency order was issued nine months after the alleged death and coincided with a civil lawsuit filed against Karch and others involved in the surgery. The lawsuit, filed in Polk County District Court by the family of Joseph Daniels, stated that on Jan. 26, 2024, the 50-year-old Daniels underwent a dental-implant operation that began at 7:15 a.m. and was completed at 3:15 p.m.
Around 3:30 p.m., paramedics were dispatched to Dental Studio of Iowa with a report of an “unconscious person.” According to the lawsuit, the paramedics arrived at 3:40 p.m. and found Daniels in a dental exam chair “pale, cyanotic, cool and unresponsive.” Daniels was then taken to Iowa Methodist Medical Center where he died at 5:51 p.m.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DENTAL-.jpg,,,2025-05-14 15:05:59.650705

The 3.1 million-square-foot facility, known as RIC6, will occupy a 107-acre parcel in the Rockville Opportunity Corridor. It joins a growing network of Amazon investments in Virginia that include fulfillment and delivery centers, dozens of data centers, Whole Foods Markets, Amazon Fresh stores, and the company’s second headquarters in Arlington.
“Virginia continues to be a great home for Amazon thanks to its robust infrastructure, talented workforce, and supportive business environment,” said Holly Sullivan, Amazon’s Vice President of Worldwide Economic Development and Public Policy. “We’re proud to officially break ground on our fourth robotics fulfillment center in the commonwealth, furthering our substantial investment in Virginia.”
The new center will handle the picking, packing, and shipping of smaller customer items such as books, electronics and toys. It follows similar sites in Suffolk, which opened in 2022, Henrico (2024) and a soon-to-launch facility in Virginia Beach.
In addition to job creation, the project has spurred transportation improvements. A diverging diamond interchange less than a mile from the site at Ashland Road (Route 623) was funded through the state’s SMART SCALE process and regional transportation dollars, aimed at easing traffic and boosting safety near the growing logistics hub.
“Having the right transportation infrastructure is essential to attracting and growing business,” said Secretary of Transportation Sheppard Miller. “Through our best-in-class SMART SCALE prioritization process, we were able to support this important transportation project and drive economic development.”
Gov. Glenn Youngkin praised the project as a reflection of “Virginia’s business-friendly environment and the quality of our workforce.”
Goochland County officials said the announcement is the result of more than a decade of strategic planning to attract major employers.
“We are thrilled to welcome Amazon to the Goochland business community,” said Board of Supervisors Chairman Tom Winfree. “Their decision to locate in the Rockville Opportunity Corridor has already proven to be beneficial to the region by helping to secure funding for critical transportation improvements.”
Since 2010, Amazon says it has invested more than $135 billion in Virginia, including infrastructure and employee compensation, and created more than 42,000 direct jobs. Company data estimates those investments support an additional 195,000 indirect jobs statewide and have contributed more than $96 billion to Virginia’s GDP.
“Amazon’s continued expansion in Virginia is a testament to the collaboration between state, regional and local partners who are committed to smart, strategic growth,” said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura. “This project is the result of long-term planning in Goochland County and strong infrastructure investments by the commonwealth.”
State lawmakers from the area also hailed the announcement as a boost to regional prosperity.
Del. David Owen, R-Henrico, said the forthcoming facility “highlights the strengths of our community” and “will create substantial employment opportunities for our residents and contribute to the economic vitality of our region.” 
And State Sen. Luther Cifers, R-Prince Edward, added: “Amazon chose well, thanks to Goochland County’s incredible work over the last 15 years that have made it one of the best places in Virginia to live and work.”

Missoula County District Court Judge Jason Marks permanently enjoined SB 99, from the 2023 Legislative session, and declined to hear remaining claims from the plaintiffs in the case, Cross et al vs. State of Montana.
The lawsuit was filed by a coalition of minors and providers as well as the American Civil Liberties Union. In 2024 the Montana Supreme Court upheld an injunction against the law being put into place.
“I will never understand why my representatives worked so hard to strip me of my rights and the rights of other transgender kids,” Phoebe Cross, a 17-year-old transgender boy who was a plaintiff in the case, said in a release. “It’s great that the courts, including the Montana Supreme Court, have seen this law for what it was, discriminatory, and today have thrown it out for good. Just living as a trans teenager is difficult enough, the last thing me and my peers need is to have our rights taken away.”
Mark’s order said SB 99 was discriminatory, prevented trans people from accessing medical information and that it infringed on the plaintiffs’ right to privacy, among other issues the court found with the law.
The law would have banned the use of treatments like puberty blockers and surgeries, which are gender-affirming care. The law also would not have banned the same sort of treatment for cisgender children.
“The Montana Constitution protects the privacy and dignity of all Montanans,” Akilah Deernose, ACLU-MT Executive Director said in a release. “In the face of those protections, cruel and inhumane laws like SB 99 will always fail.  Today’s decision should be a powerful message to those that seek to marginalize and harass transgender Montanans.”
Defendants in the case also pointed to “detransitioners” as an argument to support their case that the law was protecting minors. The court said it would lead to “absurd” results.
“Under Defendants’ reasoning, the State could infringe on minors’ fundamental rights whenever any minor was protected at the expense of the majority of minors,” the order reads. “For example, the State could categorically ban all influenza vaccines for all minors in an effort to protect the small percentage of minors who experience allergic reactions to that vaccine. This line of reasoning would lead to absurd results.”
The court also said the state’s interest in the case was “political and ideological.” 
Lambda Legal, which helped bring the lawsuit, also pointed to another case it’s supporting, with the U.S. Supreme Court expected to soon rule on U.S. v. Skrmetti. That case challenges a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming hormonal therapies for transgender youth, saying the law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
The state could appeal the decision to the Montana Supreme Court, but representatives from the AG’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the ruling.

Catherine Lang was evicted from her apartment outside Chicago after the police saw her swerving in traffic and charged her with driving drunk. A jury found her not guilty, but by then it was too late.

Dalarie Hardimon was evicted after the police chased a man speeding in her van through a residential neighborhood.

And Catherine Garcia was ordered out of the townhouse she and her sons had lived in for 20 years. Their offense? Making too many 911 calls. Most of them came from Ms. Garcia’s intellectually disabled son.

The three women lived in Illinois cities that have adopted what are known as crime-free housing laws, local ordinances that empower the police and landlords to evict tenants who are accused of breaking the law.

The laws were promoted as a way to clear out violent criminals, drug dealers and nuisance tenants who made life miserable for their neighbors. But an investigation by The New York Times and the Illinois Answers Project shows that many cities in Illinois have turned crime-free housing programs into a blunt instrument to oust families for virtually any alleged infraction, no matter how minor.

In the most comprehensive statewide review to date, the news organizations examined cases in which renters were found to have violated the ordinances in 25 Illinois towns. Reporters interviewed dozens of landlords and tenants, and gathered police records. Ultimately they found more than 2,000 enforcement incidents across the state from 2019 to 2024.

City officials ordered landlords to evict tenants in nearly 500 of those cases.

The outcomes were unclear in most of the remaining cases because none of the cities tracked what happened after they sent violation letters. Landlords can seek an eviction even when cities do not demand it.

About a third of the 2,000 violation letters cited serious crimes. Landlords were ordered to evict or take other actions against renters caught in possession of drugs or charged with violent felonies. Sometimes, there were multiple accusations and a long trail of police interactions or neighbor complaints.

But the majority of the cases fell short of that. More than 1,300 were for misdemeanors or noncriminal offenses, many of which were never pursued by prosecutors. Most cities have crafted their laws so they can evict tenants even if the renters are never convicted of a crime, or never proved to have harmed their neighbors.

City police departments have ordered landlords to evict people over commonplace charges including shoplifting and driving while intoxicated. Renters have lost their homes based on accusations that they neglected their pets, failed to keep a close watch on their children and, in one case, eavesdropped on a neighbor. In many cities, a single violation was enough to trigger an eviction.

Enforcement of the laws often appeared to have little to do with protecting people from criminal activity next door. Hundreds of the infractions occurred somewhere other than at the rental property, including at gas stations and stores, or after traffic stops that occurred miles away from a tenant’s home.

It did not matter if the person accused was the leaseholder. Entire families have been forced from their homes after a child living there was accused of a crime, or a visitor was arrested. In at least five cases, renters were flagged because they had called 911 to get help or to report a crime that had been committed against them.

Officials in more than a dozen municipalities said that their crime-free programs were fair and that the laws had led to drastic reductions in 911 calls and reports of nuisances in rental communities.

Several noted that they had modified their programs over the years, often in response to complaints from landlords and renters, to ensure that only serious infractions led to evictions.

Matthew Eiskant, the chief of police in Belleville, said entire neighborhoods in his town, just outside St. Louis, have been “revitalized” by evicting just a few people.

“Our citizens are overwhelmingly in support of crime-free housing,” Chief Eiskant said.

But many cities, including Belleville, still have ordinances that allow them to seek evictions against virtually anyone the police suspect of breaking the law. Four landlords interviewed by The Times and Illinois Answers said they had each tried to help at least one tenant fight an eviction they thought was unnecessary or unfair. Enforcement records revealed many more cases in which landlords challenged evictions in hopes of keeping good tenants.



[caption id=""attachment_66774"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""] Kate Walz, a lawyer in Chicago, has sought legislation that would limit or ban crime-free housing programs in Illinois. (Credit: Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times)[/caption]



Mary Aviles, a landlord in Midlothian, a Chicago suburb, said she had called the police when she noticed a tenant had been leaving dogs caged in the home’s garage. While concerned about the dogs, she was shocked when the police ordered her to evict the tenants without warning; she felt the offense had not endangered others.

If she did not evict her tenant, Ms. Aviles faced fines up to $750 a day or losing her license to run a rental property, common penalties in most cities.

“It completely goes against the fundamentals of our justice system,” she said.

Housing advocates have long argued that the laws are discriminatory because they disproportionately fall on low-income residents and people of color. Tenants in several states have sued and won six-figure settlements against cities, some of which were accused of evicting Black tenants based on little more than vague suspicions called into the police by neighbors.

For years, Kate Walz, a lawyer in Chicago, and other housing advocates have sought legislation that would limit or ban crime-free housing programs statewide.

The latest effort, a bill being debated in the Illinois State Senate, would create sweeping regulations for the laws and make it more difficult for people to be evicted if they have not been convicted. The bill is scheduled for a Senate committee vote this week.

Ms. Walz said that the legislation would not solve all the challenges of crime-free housing programs, but that it would help protect renters from overzealous enforcement.

“There’s no supervision. There’s no education in terms of eviction laws or fair housing laws that they need to abide by,” Ms. Walz said. “Why would you do any other kinds of law enforcement, right?”

The expansion of crime-free housing

Fear helped spread crime-free housing laws across Illinois.

In 2000, the Chicago Housing Authority began tearing down Cabrini-Green, a massive public housing complex that had been painted as a haven for crime. Elected leaders in the small cities encircling Chicago worried about where the displaced renters would move.

Officials in dozens of towns adopted the ordinances and launched training programs for landlords. Training presentations featured pictures of Cabrini-Green and slides warning that criminals would “grow like weeds” and “choke out healthy plants.”

Ms. Walz described a kind of arms race among the cities, which rushed to start programs so they would not be communities where supposed lawbreakers felt welcome.

More than 100 cities adopted the laws. One in four Illinois residents now lives in a place that compels renters to sign a lease contract that states a tenant can be evicted if accused of a crime.

Many cities require tenants to sign crime-free leases that are so broad that virtually any perceived violation could be grounds for eviction, even if the allegations are never fully investigated or proved.

In Orland Park, renters must sign a contract that says they can be evicted after a single arrest. “Proof of violation shall not require a criminal conviction,” the contract reads.

In DeKalb, a university town about an hour outside Chicago, rental contracts state that tenants can be evicted for any allegation, from a violent felony to a municipal code violation, which can include setting off fireworks or giving alcohol to a minor. The tenant is held accountable for anyone visiting the household, even if the tenant was unaware of the guest’s behavior, or unable to control it.

By 2015, enforcement in some Illinois cities had gotten so aggressive that state legislators passed a law barring city officials from evicting victims of domestic violence for calling 911. Some towns had been counting domestic assault reports at a given address and evicting everyone living there, including the victims.

Despite the reform, The Times and Illinois Answers found hundreds of instances where cities ordered tenants evicted after a domestic violence call to 911, most of them in Belleville. Mr. Eiskant said his program has never evicted a victim of domestic violence.

But advocates point out that it is often difficult for the police to determine who the aggressor is in a domestic violence case. And sometimes a person accused of abuse is the primary breadwinner, meaning that if he or she is evicted, the entire family may have to leave.

Beyond the 2015 law, there is virtually no statewide oversight of crime-free housing ordinances, leading to vast differences in how cities apply the laws.

Among the 25 cities examined by The Times and Illinois Answers, most opened fewer than 10 crime-free cases a year from 2021 to 2024, and ordered evictions about a quarter of the time. With an average of 84 cases a year, Belleville was among the most aggressive. It required an eviction in every case.

And then there is Oak Forest, a city of 26,000 people just south of Chicago, where the police pursued an average of 178 cases a year, more than double any other Illinois city over that period.

‘Just arresting people wasn’t fixing the problem’

The Manchester Court Apartments rise up from a tangle of strip malls and residential buildings that make up the second ward of Oak Forest.

Hundreds of people live in the complex, many of them blue collar workers who take the commuter train to neighboring suburbs for cleaning and industrial jobs. For years, the cluster of three-story brick buildings had a reputation for being rundown and dangerous.

During a recent visit to the complex, Jason Reid, who retired in March as the chief of police in Oak Forest, described how it once operated like an open-air drug market, with shadowy figures loitering day and night. Residents, he said, were fearful of going outside.

These days, children wait for the morning bus with their parents, and play in the parking lot after school lets out.

“You wouldn’t have seen that 15 years ago,” Mr. Reid said. “Just arresting people wasn’t fixing the problem.”

In recent years, Oak Forest police officials have sent a steady stream of letters to property managers at the complex, informing them if tenants had run-ins with the police. The letters arrived more than once a month on average from 2020 to 2024; at least six cases required an eviction.

Across the city, crime-free enforcement was even more aggressive during that period. Since 2019, the city has sent about 1,000 notification letters to landlords, enough to give one to half of the rental units in the city.

Hundreds of the notification letters were about noise complaints; 32 were about animal welfare. At least two-thirds were for misdemeanors or noncriminal violations.

Like most cities, Oak Forest did not track how many notifications prompted landlords to evict tenants. But in at least 30 cases, city officials included language demanding that a landlord evict a tenant, usually over an alleged felony, a review of the letters shows.

Housing advocates said that cities like Oak Forest, in their rush to crack down on crime, have forced people out of some of the region’s only affordable housing and put them at risk of becoming homeless.

In 2021, Oak Forest police found a man overdosing on the floor of his apartment. The next day, police department officials ordered the man’s landlord to evict him. Last year, the police told a landlord to evict a family after a teenager who lived in the home was accused of stealing cars in Chicago with his friends. And at least four families were evicted after someone in the home was caught by the police smoking marijuana.



[caption id=""attachment_66770"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""] To avoid eviction, Ms. Diop had to sue the city of Palatine. She discovered someone accused of a crime had falsely given her residence as her home address. (Credit: Jamie Kelter Davis/For The New York Times)[/caption]



They all had just a few weeks to move out and come up with the money to move somewhere else.

Oak Forest’s ordinance grants landlords, but not tenants, the opportunity to appeal the city’s decision to issue a crime-free housing violation. Tenants can be left in the dark because city officials send violation letters to landlords and make no effort to communicate with tenants, or explain why the tenants have been targeted for eviction.

In cities that do offer renters a chance to appeal, tenants are generally on their own to hire a lawyer. In many cities, the person ruling on appeals is the police chief or the crime-free housing officer, who would have ordered the eviction in the first place.

Gail Diop, a former resident of Palatine, a suburban community northwest of Chicago, tried for weeks to convince the police her family had not violated the city’s crime-free housing laws in 2016.

In the end, she had to hire a lawyer and sue the city. Only then did she discover why the city had sought to evict her: A friend of her teenage son had been arrested on shoplifting charges at a Walmart, and had falsely given the police their home address as his residence.

The city stopped the eviction and offered Ms. Diop $10,000 for the error.

Ms. Diop eventually left Palatine because she was concerned her son would be targeted. “How can I respect officers of the law that would do people like this?” she said.

‘I’m a nuisance, I can’t call 911’

The appeals hearings in Granite City, a steel town near St. Louis, offer a window into what residents experience when they try to fight evictions under crime-free housing laws.

Audio recordings of 22 hearings from 2018 and 2019, obtained by lawyers who were suing the city, show that most tenants who were appealing did not have a lawyer or fully understand the proceedings. Some said they did not know what they or their family members had been accused of, or what they needed to prove to avoid eviction.

The hearings during that period were overseen by Scott Griffith, a former attorney hired by Granite City, who died in 2023.

The hearings — as many as 12 a day — lasted about 10 minutes. Tenants were told, often on the spot and for the first time, that they were expected to cross-examine the police officers themselves and to offer any legal objections to evidence that the officers had entered into the record.

Reginald and Monique Harris appeared lost at the start of their hearing in 2018. Their son, who was 18 at the time, had been arrested on charges of having cannabis in his pocket. They said they didn’t know anything about the incident because he was living on his own across the state line, in St. Louis.

At one point, Mrs. Harris burst into tears as she begged the hearing officer not to uproot the entire family, including her 11-year-old daughter.

Mr. Griffith rescinded the city’s order to evict.

Less than a year later, the couple was back. Their son had been accused of banging on a McDonald’s drive-through window so hard that it broke. He had left his drink inside, but workers ignored his knocks because they had closed.

It had been more than a year since the Harris’s son lived in the home. But old documentation still tied him to the address, and the family once again faced the prospect of being evicted.

The family took time away from work to go to the hearings and gathered mail and documents to make their case.

“We’re the kind of folks you want in your neighborhood,” Mr. Harris said during an impassioned eight-minute speech at the hearing. “This is not just residency on the line for me, this is my life,” he added. The family was let off the hook.

Many tenants choose not to appeal, because of the hassle or the belief that they would not win. Some cities do not provide for an administrative appeal, leaving tenants no option but to wait for a formal eviction notice and to fight it in court.

That’s the decision Catherine Garcia faced in 2023, when West Chicago officials told her she would have to move out of the modest rental she had lived in for 20 years. She moved out to avoid a formal eviction.

Ms. Garcia had raised her four boys in the townhouse. She loved the tree-lined streets and the relative quiet of being outside the big city. She said she always paid her rent on time.

But problems emerged as her sons grew up. Things came to a head in 2023, when two of the three adult sons who still lived with her began struggling with their mental health.

One son, diagnosed with a severe intellectual disability, constantly called 911 for issues like losing his mother’s phone number, or suffering a headache. Ms. Garcia said his frustrations sometimes erupted into violent fits where he would punch walls or push his family members, forcing them to call the police.

The other son had spiraled into a depression. He often threatened to end his own life, and Ms. Garcia felt she had no choice but to call 911 each time.

By the fall of 2023, officials in the West Chicago Police Department had had enough. The Garcias had called 911 more than 100 times in a year, and were labeled repeat offenders under the city’s crime-free housing law.

Ms. Garcia’s landlord gave her 10 days to move out. Her youngest son found the eviction notice posted on the door.

She could not afford the deposit on a new apartment, so she made plans to move into a hotel room across town for $700 a week. It cost twice what she had been paying for a fraction of the space, which she planned to share with three of her adult sons.

She spent days throwing out items her family had accumulated over 20 years: Christmas decorations; her sons’ youth sports jerseys; bedroom furniture her grandmother had left her; and the China cabinet, which she broke into pieces so the city could haul it away.

“I was just in depression and denial,” she said. “How could this be happening?”

The night before the Garcias were to move into the hotel, a friend offered a vacant home she owned in town. It was a financial lifeline, but the house needed work. The bathroom was unfinished and the furnace was on its way out. They spent a month sleeping on mattresses on the dining room floor.

A year later, Ms. Garcia, who works at a milk distribution company and gets financial help from her sons and their father, bought the house. She said her family was finding some balance, but there have been times when she felt she needed help and was afraid to call the police.

“I’m like, ‘oh my God, I’m a nuisance, I can’t call 911,’” she said.

(Photo by TEK IMAGE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)Both chambers of the Maine Legislature have thrown overwhelming support behind legislation that would require insurance carriers in Maine to cover medically necessary blood tests for so-called forever chemicals. 
The Senate on Tuesday unanimously passed LD 582, which would require health insurance carriers to cover blood tests for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, when they are deemed medically necessary. The House of Representatives then voted 115-26 in support of its passage Wednesday with backing from all Democrats and many Republicans. 
The bill will go back to each chamber for enactment votes before it can be sent to Gov. Janet Mills for final approval. Because the bill will require some funding, it also needs to be included in the upcoming budget.
Thirty years ago, Rep. Paul Flynn (R-Albion) received a letter that the dairy farm next to his home would be spreading sludge on its land. At the time, he was told there was nothing to worry about. But like many Maine residents, he now lives in an area surrounded by PFAS, which are also known as forever chemicals because of their durability.
“This is something that has snuck up on us,” Flynn said on the House floor Wednesday. “It is in front of us, and it is very, very real.”
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has identified more than 1,000 sites throughout the state that could be affected by former sludge application. The state has a robust response program that currently provides technical and financial assistance to more than 80 farms with varying levels of contamination. That work will continue thanks to legislation passed earlier this year enshrining the program into law.
But contamination isn’t just contained to the land. It can get into waterways, drinking wells and ultimately, people’s bloodstreams. Exposure to the chemicals has been linked to health concerns including cancer, liver damage, pregnancy complications, increased cholesterol levels and more. Workplace exposure is high for firefighters, chemical manufacturers and ski wax technicians while communities exposed to spills of PFAS-laden products, like the one in Brunswick last summer, also face risk.
The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday it is changing the standards for certain types of PFAS in drinking water that were finalized under the Biden administration and could have lowered exposure for millions of Americans. While the federal agency is weakening the limit for some of the forever chemicals, it is maintaining others but delaying the deadline to meet the standards.
Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) said she has had her blood tested three times since her community received notification of high PFAS levels. The tests showed high levels of the forever chemicals in her body. However, she said she couldn’t support LD 582 because she doesn’t believe in mandates. 
“I’m not a fan, obviously, of the PFAS, but I’m also not a fan of the mandates, so I will be voting against this,” Rudnicki said on the House floor. 
She also raised concerns that the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee suggested the state use money from the PFAS Fund to help defray costs. Mills created the fund in 2022 to help address contaminated farmland and the Legislature appropriated $60 million for that use.
The committee also amended the bill to prohibit insurance carriers from imposing any cost-sharing to cover the blood tests, and pushed back the start date to apply to health plans issued or renewed after Jan. 1, 2027.

An anti-pornography organization in Washington, D.C., more recently filed four federal lawsuits in Kansas comparable to action taken by the state attorney general. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A bundle of federal lawsuits in Kansas have been filed on behalf of a 14-year-old Olathe resident alleging owners of online businesses violated a state law mandating steps be taken to prevent minors from accessing pornography lacking scientific, artistic or political value.
The law center of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, a conservative anti-pornography organization in Washington, D.C., collaborated with a Hutchinson law firm to file suit on behalf of minor Q.R. and his mother Jane Doe against jerkmate.com, Techpump Solutions’ superporn.com, Titan Websites and chaturbate.com.
In each instance, the lawsuits allege, a company failed to comply with a state law that took effect July 1, 2024, requiring deployment of age verification systems on pornography websites to block consumers under the age of 18.
The court documents asserted Q.R. used one of his mother’s old laptops to access internet pornography from the four companies more than 170 times from August to October 2024.
“Kansas law requires pornography companies to implement reasonable age verification methods, and the companies named in these lawsuits failed to do so,” said Dani Pinter, director of the legal division of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation.
In January, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach filed a similar lawsuit in Shawnee County District Court against Seattle-based SARJ LLC, which distributed pornography on more than a dozen websites and was purportedly owned by individuals who controlled jerkmate.com.
Kobach asserted in the state court filing that SARJ didn’t make use of age-gating technology that would “protect Kansas children from the negative health consequences that stem from unfettered access to pornography.”
The federal lawsuits filed by Joshua Ruhlmann, a Hutchinson attorney, claimed the website content accessed by Q.R. was harmful because it had a tendency to appeal to a minor’s prurient interest in sex, was offensive to prevailing standards with respect to what was suitable for minors and lacked serious literary, scientific, educational, artistic or political value for a viewer under age 18.
Specifically, one of the federal lawsuits alleged at least one-fourth of jerkmate.com’s webpages viewed during a calendar month included “material containing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement and/or sadomasochistic abuse.”
That court filing said minors who visited the website were asked to click an “I AGREE” button, which ostensibly verified the user was over the age of 18. That site warned users the company’s content was restricted to consumers reached the age majority in the jurisdiction in which they resided.
“Despite expressly aiming their websites at Kansas citizens, defendants have failed to ensure that jerkmate.com and/or jerkmatelive.com comply with Kansas law which requires pornographic websites to employ age verification measures,” the suit said.
The National Center on Sexual Exploitation, previously known as Morality in Media, has lobbied against sex trafficking, same-sex marriage, decriminalization of sex work, comprehensive sex education and works of art that could be viewed as obscene.
Pinter said the family serving as plaintiffs in the organization’s lawsuits in U.S. District Court in Kansas “deserves every measure of justice.”
“It is unreasonably dangerous for these pornography websites to provide this product which they know is harmful to children, that children are drawn to access, and do access, without employing age verification as required by Kansas law,” she said.
In April 2024, Gov. Laura Kelly allowed the age-verification bill to become law without her signature. It was approved unanimously in the Senate and 92-31 by the House. Kelly said the pornography statute could “end up infringing on constitutional rights” of Kansans and inspire lawsuits against the state.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6170161-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-14 15:05:59.650705

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Although the solar industry has been operating in Louisiana for years, state lawmakers took their first stab at making uniform rules and regulations, only to kill the effort.
Some parishes have had to make their own rules for the installation and construction of household solar panels and larger arrays or “farms.” Local officials have asked the state to create a guidebook to guide their decisions. 
However, House Bill 615, by Rep. Brett Geymann, R-Lake Charles, failed to pass the balancing act of granting local regulatory power and giving the solar industry what it says they need to operate. It failed in a 47-52 House floor vote.
Geymann’s testimony in committee and on the House floor focused on projects across the state that did not have a local ordinance in place and have become what he called eyesores. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Driving over the Mississippi River Bridge from Baton Rouge into Port Allen, the remnants of an old solar farm – one of the first built in the state – are still visible. Rep. Jeremy LaCombe, R-Livonia, said in a House Committee on Natural Resources and Environment hearing his constituents who live nearby still have to deal with the unsightly defunct farm.   
Other projects in Franklinton, Springfield, and Monroe were scrutinized in the hearing as poorly maintained and supposedly bringing down surrounding property values.
Committee member Rep. Shane Mack, R-Livingston, recalled his time on the Livingston Parish Council, where members struggled to find a solution for a proposed solar farm. Constituents were largely concerned with having to look at the solar panels from their residential properties.
“I wish we could go back in time, and this legislation [would have been] in place. Because if it had been, I think a lot of the complaints I received then and that I still receive today probably could have been avoided,” Mack said.
“We’re not here today because everything is going great in the solar industry, because it’s not,” Geymann said.
His bill would have set requirements for the distance between any solar project and the closest residential property, keeping them a mile apart in its initial version. Industry interests said the standard would be impossible to meet. 
Geymann said he plans to bring a different version of his bill next year. He voiced frustrations around industry leaders allegedly not assisting him in giving direct solutions or amendments.
“We have worked on this for an entire year … We have sought input from people all over, and right now we believe we are in a good spot [with the bill],” Geymann said before the floor vote.
Norby Chabert, a lobbyist for the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said group members met with Geymann before the committee hearing on his bill, outlining parts that would make it extremely difficult on solar projects in Louisiana. He said he would work with Geymann to help craft next year’s proposal.
Some lawmakers struggled with the bill because it would have overtaken some local ordinances and replaced them with the new state rules. It did allow for local governments to work with solar project developers to ask the state for permission to soften some state rules, but they could not fully opt out of them.
“I just want to make sure this doesn’t supersede what is already in place and somehow lets these facilities off the hook to drop their financial assurance,” LaCombe said.
Solar projects would have had to get clearance from the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, as they already do for their decommissioning plans.
Geymann had made changes to his bill in response to industry criticisms and modeled it after ordinances in Tangipahoa Parish, which are considered the most restrictive in the state. Still, his measure drew opposition from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, Greater New Orleans Inc., the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association and the Baton Rouge Area Chamber.
State Rep. Matthew Willard, D-New Orleans, said that if Geyman’s bill had passed, it would have made Louisiana one of the most restrictive states for solar projects.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The number of people experiencing homelessness recently in New Mexico is two to four times higher than previous estimates, according to a new research paper from the state health department. 
In findings researchers announced Wednesday, nearly 31,000 unhoused people, including 869 children under age 5, sought care at non-federal hospitals in New Mexico between 2019 and 2013. Researchers arrived at that number by analyzing certain fields within 10 million patient visit records, searching for patient addresses being listed as known homeless shelters or simply “homeless,” among other indicators.
Quantifying the number of people who live on the streets in New Mexico is a “pervasive” problem, the study notes. The annual “point-in-time” count, which the federal Housing and Urban Development department requires for certain federal grants, is an undercount and can vary based on numerous factors. 
But it’s still considered an official count, and can be useful to detect trends, including huge increases in homelessness observed in Albuquerque and throughout the rest of the state in the most recent report. 

Read the study here.

In what they described as a novel approach to counting the state’s unhoused population, New Mexico Department of Health researchers Hayley Peterson and Dylan Pell determined that 30,882 patients experiencing homelessness visit hospitals nearly 183,000 times between 2019 and 2023, or nearly six visits each. The number of unhoused patients was about 8,000 in 2019 and hit a peak of a little more than 10,500 in 2022.
“Public health approaches that address infectious disease, environmental health, drug overdose, suicide and injury should include strategies to support [people experiencing homelessness] and promote stable housing,” said Miranda Durham, Chief Medical Officer for the Department of Health, in a news release. “Health system interventions like screening for housing needs and linking people to housing services can have positive health impacts.” 
The new report’s numbers are far higher than the “point-in-time” counts for those years. In 2022, for example, volunteers counted about 2,600 people in homeless shelters and on the streets. In 2019, they counted 3,241. 
The counties with the highest numbers of unhoused patients were Bernalillo, Santa Fe, Doña Ana and San Juan, according to the report.
Amid funding cut threats and homeless camp sweeps, a volunteer loses hope but keeps counting

Two-thirds of the patients were male, according to the report. Nearly 40% were Hispanic, another 40% were white, and 15% were American Indian or Alaska Native in a state where about 12% of the total population is Native American. 
A little over 2,100 of the people counted, comprising 7% of the people the researchers counted, were under age 18. 
The researchers also examined medical diagnoses the patients received, finding the top “comorbidity” along with homelessness, was alcohol-related disorders, with 17% of patients having that diagnosis. About 8% had a stimulant-related disorders, 7.1% had schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders and 4.8% were suicidal, among other common diagnoses, according to the report.
About 455 people were treated related to their pregnancy, a finding that indicates “additional supportive housing needs for families during a vulnerable life stage,” researchers wrote. 
The researchers determined that their method of counting and analyzing homelessness could help present a clearer picture of an issue that has long plagued the state.

Katie Miro, a first-grade teacher at Newark Charter School, has been named the 2025 Delaware Charter School Teacher of the Year, the Delaware Charter Schools Network (DCSN) announced at its annual IDEA Awards.
“Being recognized as Delaware Charter Network’s Teacher of the Year is an incredible honor that affirms the dedication and love I pour into my work each day,” Miro said. “It means even more to me because it reflects the deep relationships I’ve built with my students and their families over time.”
With over 17 years of teaching experience, Miro was recognized for her dedication to creating an engaging and nurturing learning environment.
“These connections are the foundation of everything we do as educators and remind us daily that educating young people is not a solo effort,” Miro said. “Charter schools have the unique opportunity to foster a special connection between families and schools by encouraging close collaboration and active parental involvement in shaping students’ educational experiences.”

Others praise Miro
Known for integrating nature into the classroom and championing outdoor education, she also plays a key role beyond the classroom—mentoring new teachers, serving on the school council, and leading the school’s nature club.
“Katie Miro is exactly the kind of teacher every child deserves—one who is dedicated, innovative, and deeply invested in student success,” said Gregory Meece, founding school director of Newark Charter School.
Sam Golder, head of school at Newark Charter, praised Katie’s impact.
“Katie Miro couples an effervescent personality with an incomparable work ethic,” Golder said. “She is a shining example of excellence in teaching, leadership and selflessness. Newark Charter School is so fortunate to have Katie on the team. I
cannot think of a better representative for [Delaware’s] Teacher of the Year!”
Kendall Massett, the executive director of the Delaware Charter Schools Network emphasized the importance of educators like Miro.
“We believe every child deserves an opportunity for an excellent public education,” she said. “The way to do so is with amazing educators like Katie Miro. We are proud of our phenomenal educators across all our charter schools in Delaware, but we had to choose one to represent them all. I believe that Katie will be an incredible representative for all teachers in the state of Delaware. “
Delaware is home to 24 public charter schools serving more than 19,000 students. Charter schools in the state are publicly funded, tuition-free, and operate with increased flexibility while being held accountable for student achievement.
“Together, as a charter community, we have created supportive, inclusive environments where children can thrive, and I am so grateful to be part of that journey,” Miro said.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-14-at-2.30.06-PM.png,,,2025-05-14 15:05:59.650705

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)RICHMOND — With approval of its governing board, Eastern Kentucky University became the first in the state to formally adopt policies that bring it into compliance with a Republican-backed state law banning diversity, equity and inclusion practices at Kentucky public universities. 
In its Wednesday meeting, the EKU Board of Regents passed a policy to uphold viewpoint neutrality and a resolution showing EKU plans to comply with the recently passed House Bill 4. The board also approved removing words such as “diverse” from its strategic goals. No board members voted against the measures in a voice vote. 
Kentucky public universities have been reviewing HB 4 since its passage by the Republican-controlled General Assembly earlier this year. GOP caucuses in the House and Senate easily had the votes to override Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of the law, which he said “is about hate.” 
In his veto message, the governor wrote, “Acting like racism and discrimination no longer exist or that hundreds of years of inequality have been somehow overcome and there is a level playing field is disingenuous.” He also said the law would prevent universities and colleges from investigating allegations of bias except in limited circumstances.

EKU’s board members had little discussion on the new policies before they cast votes. Regent Laura Babbage asked questions about how the university will still support students from a variety of backgrounds. She added that she hoped as an institution, EKU “believes that we have responsibility to our brothers and sisters, regardless of their race, creed, beliefs or whatever the case might be.” 
“I’m not speaking for the board. I’m speaking for Laura Babbage, but I am just saying that that is an essential part of who I am,” she said. “And so as we have issues that come before us that perhaps need a voice, I will, in fact, be that voice.” 
EKU President David McFaddin said in response to Babbage that supporting all students would remain a focus of the administration. 
“Student success will continue to be our focus. Supporting students — every student — in every way that we can will continue to be a part of the institution,” he said.

The newly adopted university policy — titled “Institutional Viewpoint Neutrality” —  says that EKU “does not discriminate against individuals or groups based on their social or political viewpoints and values the contributions of all community members to robust dialogue and the free exchange of viewpoints to contribute to an intellectually diverse campus community.” The university may not require anyone to “endorse or condemn a specific ideology, political viewpoint, or social viewpoint to be eligible for hiring, contract renewal, tenure, promotion, admission or graduation.” Directing the state’s public universities to adopt such viewpoint neutrality policies was a tenet of HB 4. 
The university policy says that the EKU president has the only authority to issue official statements on behalf of the university, and may designate someone else to issue statements as needed. The board chair has a similar authority to issue official statements of the board. The president and board chair are prohibited from issuing official statements “on political, social or cultural matters that are not directly related to the operations, mission or legal obligations of the University.” The policy says that any violation “will be handled through the normal University processes.” 
The board also approved changes to the university’s strategic goals, removing a reference to supporting “EKU’s diverse learners” and replacing the word “inclusivity” with “respect.” The changes also remove “Inclusion” as a guiding value of the university, which was defined as “Community engagement, Diversity of people and perspectives, Professional growth, Hospitality, Celebration” and replaces it with “Opportunity,” defined as “Community Engagement, Multiple Perspectives and Lived Experiences, Professional Growth, Hospitality, Celebration.” 
The resolution approved by the board says EKU will follow the state law. An EKU spokesperson previously told the Kentucky Lantern the university planned to comply with the law. 
  Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy. (LRC Public Information)
The bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, said in a statement after filing the legislation that it sought “to prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, race, sex, color, or national origin, and ensure that our university campuses are free from the failed and misguided DEI policies that have proven only to make higher education less attainable for Kentuckians.”
In a statement ahead of Wednesday’s board meeting, Decker said the law ended “discriminatory and wasteful practices on our public postsecondary campuses.” Decker added that the law ensures Kentucky public colleges “provide equal treatment to all of their students and judge students on their individual merits, not on their race, color, or creed.”
“These are institutions of learning and must focus on improving the quality of education on their campuses and increasing enrollment among all Kentuckians,” Decker said. 
HB 4 directs the governing boards of Kentucky’s public universities to enact a policy by June 30 to meet requirements under the law such as not restricting scholarship eligibility criteria on the basis of religion, race, sex, color or national origin and not requiring or encouraging students to complete courses “of which the primary purpose is to indoctrinate participants with a discriminatory concept.”
Next year on July 1, each institution must begin submitting annual certification to the Council on Postsecondary Education to verify the institution has not spent money to support DEI programs.
The law largely had support from Republicans in both the state House and Senate throughout the legislative session earlier this year. 
It comes on the heels of Republicans nationwide aiming to rollback DEI programs. President Donald Trump has taken actions against such programs, including issuing an executive order   
early in his second term aimed at curbing DEI in private sector businesses. More recently, Trump signed an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Education to overhaul university and college accreditation programs to root out DEI standards. 
Before the General Assembly passed the law, Kentucky college students held protests against the legislation on their campuses, including EKU. Students also voiced opposition in committee hearings and protests at the Capitol.

File photo by Natalie Williams/VTDiggerRutland teachers and the city’s school board reached a tentative agreement Tuesday night, averting what would have been the first teachers’ strike in Vermont in eight years. At a marathon school board meeting, the Rutland Education Association — the local union representing the city’s teachers — and district officials struck a deal for a new contract just before midnight following eight hours of negotiations, according to Daren Allen, the communications director for the Vermont National Education Association, the statewide teachers’ union. Allen said details of the agreement would not be released until after the contract is formally ratified by both parties, a process that could take up to a week. “This negotiation started at 4 p.m. yesterday, and both parties stayed at the table to get it done. Both parties worked really hard to achieve a settlement,” Allen said. “Today, the teachers are just relieved, and they now want to focus on their jobs.” After voting to strike last week, the union, which includes approximately 250 members, had intended to walk out of work indefinitely starting Wednesday if no deal was reached. The teachers had been working without a contract since last summer, when the previous one expired.READ MORE

“The board is happy that we came to a resolution,” said Charlene Seward, a commissioner of the school board. “This is a great outcome for the students to continue out the rest of the year, and we’re happy for the community support, and we’re just glad that we could make it all work out.” The agreement caps off a year and half of contentious negotiations between the union and the school district, which first began last January. After months of bargaining, the two parties had reached an impasse over wages. The union had initially proposed that teacher salaries increase by 15% for the 2024-2025 school year, 10% for 2025-2026 and 10% for 2026-2027. The school board had meanwhile pitched increases of 3% each year, citing restraints imposed by the district’s $63.8 million budget for the 2024-2025 school year.After failing to find middle ground earlier this year, the two parties agreed to work with an independent fact-finder, who released a report last month calling for about 5% wage increases each year. Rejecting the mediator’s findings, the school board last week moved to impose a contract on the district’s teachers for the next two years, a decision the union claimed violated Vermont labor laws. Under the temporarily imposed contract, the board had included salary increases of 4.8% for the first year and 4% for the second year. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rutland teachers and school board reach agreement, averting strike.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rutland-High-School_Natalie-Williams-1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-14 15:05:59.650705

More than six months ago, Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), who at the time was serving as the minority vice chair of the House elections committee, made a request to the Michigan Department of State seeking access to the Bureau of Elections e-learning portal, which provides education and training materials for the state’s election clerks.
While Smit’s office went back and forth with the Department of State, with Smit later filing a request in her official capacity as the chair of the now-renamed Elections Integrity Committee, she ultimately brought the matter before the House Oversight Committee, which issued a subpoena to the Secretary of State requesting any materials that had not already been provided by May 13 to Committee Chair Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township). 
Although the Department has been working to fulfill Smit and DeBoyer’s requests, a May 7 response to the subpoena from Assistant Attorney General Heather Meingast on behalf of Benson’s office reiterated security concerns in releasing these training documents to the Oversight Committee without review and redaction that would “reveal security feature information or other sensitive information jeopardizes the [voting] process.”
“This is true even if those seeking the information are well-intentioned, because each time sensitive information is released, its potential for intentional or accidental disclosure to those who would misuse it increases,” Meingast wrote, anticipating that the committee would again request a login credentials to the Bureau of Election’s e-learning portal to alleviate the expense and burden tied to processing this information for release. 

2025.05.07 House Oversight Committee subpeona response AG letter 
She also called into question the legality of the subpoena, noting that no provisions within state law or the House rules allows a committee to issue a subpoena on behalf of another committee, and that a subpoena is only valid if it serves a legislative purpose for the committee that issued it. 
Alongside the latest release of documents on Tuesday, Meingast noted that, as she’d predicted, the Department had been unable to complete a full review of the requested materials by the May 13 deadline. However the department would continue to release documents on a rolling basis until all items had been produced or if it determined items should be withheld due to security concerns. 
While the Department has issued a total of 3,300 pages of documents to the House Oversight Committee, including 300 pages issued Tuesday, Smit called the department’s pace “unacceptable.” 
“While we acknowledge the Department of State released new information today, there is no reason why Secretary Benson and her staff cannot fulfill the House’s subpoena in full today. For some baseless reason, they continue to release small batches of information and tout them as huge wins in transparency. It’s not transparency, it’s embarrassing,” Smit said in a statement.
“This is nothing more than a delay tactic being used by someone who seems to be petrified the public will actually find out how she’s been training our clerks. The Legislature has a responsibility to review these materials to ensure our clerks are being properly trained. Any attempts to prevent that core legislative function amounts to nothing more than clear obstruction,” said Smit, who has pushed disproven claims that the 2020 election was stolen, despite a 2021 report from the then GOP-led Senate Oversight Committee concluding there is no widespread evidence of voter fraud within the state. 
In her own statement published Tuesday, Benson reiterated that she has a duty to “protect the security of our elections from politicians seeking information that would enable someone to interfere with the chain of custody of ballots, tamper with election equipment, or impersonate a clerk on Election Day.”
“We’ll continue to work with the chair of the committee to explain these realities and we’ll do the same in a court of law,” She said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Another former South Dakota state employee has been sentenced for a crime committed while working for state government.
Danielle Degenstein, 52, of Pierre, pleaded guilty Tuesday in Hughes County Circuit Court. A news release from state Attorney General Marty Jackley said she was sentenced to a year of probation and a $500 fine, plus an amount of court costs that was not disclosed in the release. She’ll avoid spending one year in jail if she abides by the conditions of the sentence.
Degenstein’s crime was misprision of a felony, which means she failed to report her knowledge of another person’s criminal activity.
‘Don’t do that’: Attorney general says guilty verdict in state theft trial sends a message

The chain of events that led to Degenstein’s criminal charge started in August, when state Attorney General Marty Jackley said a deceased former three-decade employee of the state Department of Revenue, Sandra O’Day, had allegedly created 13 fake vehicle titles to help her secure $400,000 in loans. No charges were filed, because O’Day died before her alleged behavior came to light.
In October, Jackley announced charges against two other former Department of Revenue employees, Lynne Hunsley, 64, and Degenstein, both of Pierre.
Hunsley has since pleaded guilty to forgery and grand theft by deception for creating a fake vehicle title that she used as proof of a trade-in to help her avoid excise taxes. She was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $1,200 in restitution to the state.
Court documents said Degenstein concealed her knowledge of a crime committed by a person identified as “S.O.” — initials that match O’Day’s. A news release Wednesday from Jackley said Degenstein was investigated for knowing, and not reporting, that a Department of Revenue employee forged a power of attorney document for that employee’s financial gain.
The Degenstein case is among five criminal prosecutions that Jackley has filed against former state employees since last year for allegations related to their work with state government.
One former employee, Lonna Carroll, used her position at the Department of Social Services to steal nearly $1.8 million over the course of 13 years. A jury found Carroll guilty of grand theft, and she’s scheduled to be sentenced in July. Other criminal allegations against former state employees included falsifying food service inspections and the personal use of foster family food vouchers.
In response to the run of prosecutions, Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during the recent legislative session that will expand the investigatory authority of the state auditor, strengthen the Board of Internal Controls, institute mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report, and establish protections for whistleblowers.
Last month, Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order mandating the creation of a “secure standard reporting mechanism” for employees. The portal will deliver whistleblower reports of malfeasance to the state’s auditor and attorney general.
Lawmakers also passed legislation this year strengthening the ability of the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee to conduct investigations and issue orders known as subpoenas requiring people to testify or supply information.
Last year, then-Gov. Kristi Noem added an extra internal control officer position to the executive branch and ordered state employees to undergo annual training aimed at preventing criminal activity.

Derrick Hildebrant, R-Catoosa, is the author of a bill that would allow municipal employees and officials to carry firearms in municipal buildings. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — House lawmakers on Wednesday sent a measure to the governor to allow elected officials to carry firearms at approved municipal buildings, despite concerns it could intimidate constituents. 
House Bill 1095 would allow elected municipal officials, including judges, with a valid firearm license to carry concealed guns in any building leased or owned by the city or town in their jurisdiction with the approval of a city council or governing board. The bill excludes locations that are used to process, hold or house prisoners or people under arrest, like courthouses, courtrooms, prisons, jails or detention facilities. 
Rep. Derrick Hildebrant, R-Catoosa, said this is already being done at the county level and this bill expands it to the city level. 
“This is an option, so it’s not a mandate,” he said. “Any city council can designate firearm prohibited locations or not.” 
It could extend to a “meter reader” being able to carry firearms, if they were designated by the city and working in their jurisdictional location, Hildebrant said. 
Rep. Michelle McCane, D-Tulsa, said she is worried this could intimidate constituents or make people feel uncomfortable talking to their elected officials. 
“I want us to be safe. I want our municipal folks to be safe,” she said. “But I worry that this broad of a bill kind of creates this environment where people might be intimidated. Not everybody is as supportive of guns and that can kind of be an intimidation factor.”
Hildebrant said he has not received any negative feedback on this legislation from counties who have this measure in place. 
Rep. Nick Archer, R-Elk City, who voted in favor of it, said he was frustrated by the process he had to go through as former mayor of Elk City to carry a firearm at work. He said he was required to go through law enforcement training and earn armed security guard status to be able to carry his gun at city hall. 
The bill was previously amended by the Senate, but now heads to the governor after House lawmakers approved the amendments 70-15 along party lines.

State funding is tight and, with split control in the House and a narrow Democratic margin in the Senate, more money from new taxes is unlikely. The alternative we’re left with is to cut, and that threatens a great many harmful outcomes, most of which we won’t begin to understand until well after budget bills are signed into law. 
The Senate budget, for example, proposed to decouple the state general education formula from inflation, reneging on a 2023 commitment that itself was not enough to bring per pupil funding back to where they were before cuts made in the early 2000s. Reducation of anticipated funding will financially stress school districts, suppress teacher pay, and push up property taxes. 
Similar dynamics will be felt in health and human services, natural resources, and higher education, where tuition is expected to rise by as much as 10% to make up for insufficient state funding. 
Those are high-profile cuts that will receive a lot of public airing, but reducations and underfunding over the next several years threatens wide ranging harms that most of us have not even contemplated. Consider, for instance, the impact on Minnesotans we’ve literally hidden behind walls: Our state prisons are already dangerously underfunded and about to fall even further behind. Prisons aren’t exactly the feel-good cause of our progressive fantasies, and that’s exactly why they make such a useful example of the importance of public investment. 
If we can understand the value of a functional corrections system, then we can start to view public investment in a much more productive light. 
Many policymakers are understandably reluctant to spend money on people that have broken the law when law abiding citizens have so many unmet needs. In tight times, state corrections funding is easily neglected. Unfortunately, that logic leads to costly outcomes and untenable conditions. 
Underfunding doesn’t mean more punishment, it just means more dysfunction. And that’s bad for everyone, as the current condition of our prisons clearly demonstrates.
A 2020 report by the Office of Legislative Auditor recommended closing or replacing facilities in both Stillwater and St. Cloud due to massive deferred maintenance. These facilities, along with one in Shakopee, failed to meet federal standards that require 25 square feet of space per prisoner. Two other facilities lacked sufficient plumbing for the number of inmates they housed. 
Poor conditions like this motivated a peaceful prisoner takeover at Stillwater prison in 2023. Among the grievances were lack of access to showers, poor climate control, and curtailed programming and visiting hours due to staff shortages. A 2025 report on physical maintenance needs confirmed these issues, citing leaking, flooding, dangerously hot interior temperatures, and structural deterioration — all threats to prisoner and staff safety.
Last weekend, I attended an event where a guard from one state facility recounted how his unit suffered increased assaults and staff hospitalizations due to understaffing.
Not surprisingly, DOC has the highest turnover rate of any state agency, which is itself expensive due to the cost of hiring and overtime. More competitive pay would help, but stingy budgets make necessary raises impossible.
This is just one example of how underfunding can become self-reinforcing. Here’s another: Because most prisons have closed their medical units, prisoners in need of health care must now be treated in public hospitals where they require additional around-the-clock supervision from dedicated guards. 
On a larger scale, understaffing regularly leads to reduced programming, which curtails the amount of education, counseling and other activities aimed at shortening sentences and ensuring successful release. 
This status quo leads to poor conditions for prisoners and staff, and to enormous long-term economic and societal harm. Social science research shows that incarceration leads to intergenerational cycles of poverty, violence and antisocial behavior that greatly diminishes personal and community well-being. 
And, of course, we don’t need academics to tell us that our prison system is dysfunctional. In Minnesota, for example, someone with a history in the criminal justice system is 7 to 13 times more likely to experience homelessness and around 20% of all prisoners freed each year become homeless immediately upon release. That comes with a heavy social and fiscal cost.
DOC received a much-needed budgetary increase in 2023, but more is needed if the agency is to keep up with increasing costs and added programs that came along with the money. New investments, like the Minnesota Rehabilitation and Reinvestment Act are aimed at reducing long-term costs by improving rehabilitation outcomes. That’s the right idea, but now the program risks stalling out at the pilot phase due to lack of funding.

With so much dysfunction, many on the left would like to see prisons scaled down entirely. That is the correct goal, but broader decarceration won’t happen quickly. To get there, we need to reconceptualize prisons not as a retributional system to be managed for the least immediate cost, but as institutions designed to achieve a collective priority — the minimization and correction of violent and destructive illegal behavior. 
That will require reforming an oppressive parole system as well as greater investment in substance abuse rehabilitation, counseling, and more humane facilities to promote independence and successful reintegration. Prisoners participating in work programs should also receive a reasonable wage so that they don’t end sentences in poverty — a common reality ripe for repeat offense.
Other countries do all of this very differently, and now Pennsylvania has begun experimenting with Scandinavian style prisons, which foster rehabilitation and independence by allowing greater autonomy within the facility. With multiple failing facilities, Minnesota could be ripe for an experiment like this. But it requires placing proactive problem-solving above scornful neglect. 
This year’s budget won’t give us the modern prisons that would be safer and more conducive to rehabilitation, but the difference between the good version of this year’s budget and the bad version could be enormous. 
With just $14 million of additional funding for 2026-27 — less than a 1% agency increase, despite inflation well above that — the proposed House budget would result in staffing cuts that would make all of our problems worse. Hopefully, that position is just a figment of multi-phase bargaining (the Senate increase is about $60 million and the governor’s over $100 million), but anything like it would be disastrous for tens of thousands of inmates and workers. 
The answer to all of these troubling tradeoffs, of course, is that we could easily choose a different path. Even a relatively small tax increase could provide substantial revenue to ensure agencies like corrections have the operating adjustments they need. 
The alternative is to allow prison conditions to degrade, staffing to fall, and outcomes — which have been improving — to stagnate or decline. Minnesotans likely would not notice these changes right away, but over time it will result in slower release, less rehabilitation, and more people left lost and dispossessed from their interaction with a dysfunctional criminal justice system. The result will be higher costs and lower quality of life for all of us.

The state’s childhood vaccination rates remain high, but public health officials are bracing themselves for possible outbreaks of measles and pertussis among young children as cases of vaccine-preventable diseases have risen across the nation. 
There have been over 1,000 measles cases reported in the U.S. this year alone, compared to 285 cases last year. Three people have died from the virus, once deemed eradicated in the country, including two unvaccinated children in Texas. 
“Our first line of defense is our immunization rates,” said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney at the State Board of Health Meeting April 10.
Kindergarten vaccination rates have fallen to fourth in the nation. Last school year, the state had 97.5% coverage for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, compared to 99.1% for the 2019-2020 school year, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. A vaccine coverage rate of 95% or higher is needed to prevent measles outbreaks.
There have not yet been any reported measles cases in Mississippi, though cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, have accelerated this year. State public health officials say the risk of widespread outbreaks among young children, who are most susceptible to both diseases and severe complications that can lead to death, is low due to high vaccination rates. 
But relying solely on statewide vaccination rates can be deceiving, because it can camouflage clusters of unvaccinated people, said Jana Shaw, a professor of pediatrics at SUNY Upstate Medical University who studies childhood vaccinations and vaccine hesitancy. 
“Transmission of (measles) happens at the community level,” she said. “So if you’re looking at a state level, you may be falsely reassured that the situation is better than what you expect.” 
And vaccine exemptions are the single most important driver of disease outbreaks, said Shaw. 
Parents have requested 5,845 religious vaccine exemptions since they became available in Mississippi two years ago. Over 800 were requested this year. 
Mississippi long permitted only medical vaccine exemptions authorized by a doctor for school entry. That changed in 2023 when a federal judge ruled that parents can opt out of vaccinating their children due to religious beliefs.
The number of exemptions ranges by county, with the highest rates of vaccine exemptions among children in Lincoln, George and Stone counties, using 2023 Census data to calculate child population. 
The lowest rates of religious vaccine exemptions are in Scott, Washington and Leflore counties. 
A fourth of religious vaccine exemptions approved by the state did not list a county. This is because parents are sometimes unsure in which county a child will attend school or day care when they complete the form, said a spokesperson for the Mississippi State Department of Health. 
Only 30% of the state’s approved religious exemptions are for children enrolled in a kindergarten through 12th grade public, private or church school when the exemption was approved. The remaining 70% are for children who were homeschooled, enrolled in day care or not yet enrolled in school.
To request a religious vaccine exemption in Mississippi, a parent or guardian must submit a form and make an appointment at their local county health department to watch a vaccine education video and discuss the benefits and risks of immunization with a nurse. Parents are also informed that if any vaccine-preventable disease occurs or threatens to occur in the community, the child will not be allowed to attend school or day care. 
Religious vaccine exemptions are important because they protect parental autonomy, said Shaw. But they can become a problem when the laws are misused – for convenience or due to misinformation or disinformation. 
Mississippi’s law, which requires parents to go to the county health department and talk to a nurse, helps create safeguards against this, said Shaw, whose research has shown that the easier it is for parents to get a child exempted for non-medical reasons, the higher a state’s exemption rate.

Magnolia State baseball fans know well the traditional hardball success of the three largest universities, a tradition that continues in the spring of 2025. Three hundred teams play NCAA Division I baseball. Ole Miss, Southern Miss and Mississippi State all seem likely to make the elite 64-team NCAA Championship Tournament field.
But Mississippi’s college baseball prowess does not end there. Delta State and Mississippi College have both made the NCAA Division II Tournament and will compete in regionals in Florida later this week. Millsaps College, under the leadership of Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame coach Jim Page, has made the NCAA Division III Tournament for the first time since 2015. Belhaven University lost in the finals of its conference tournament but takes a 31-13 record into its first-ever NCAA Division III Championship Tournament. William Carey University finished its season ranked No. 10 in all of NAIA baseball with a 38-14 record. The Crusaders hosted an NAIA Regional but lost their first two games Monday and Tuesday.
What follows is a breakdown of what each of those Mississippi teams faces in postseason play:


Mississippi College enters NCAA tournament play for the first time since 2018, having won seven or its last nine games, including four consecutive victories over arch-rival Delta State. The Choctaws will face Lynn University (30-16) in the opening round Thursday at 4 p.m. The regional will be hosted by the University of Tampa. Host Tampa (43-7) will play Albany State (30-20) in the other first round game.
Tradition-rich Delta State (32-18), making its 37th NCAA Tournament appearance, plays West Florida (33-19) in a first round game Thursday at 2 p.m at Lakeland, Fla., where Florida Southern is the host school. Florida Southern (36-13) plays West Alabama (32-23) in the other first round game. Coach Rodney Batts’ DSU Statesmen badly need a return to form entering national tournament play. They have lost five straight games, including a three-game series to Mississippi College and then two straight in the Gulf South Conference tournament. Delta State played a three-game series at West Florida in early March, losing two of three.
A quick look at Millsaps’ baseball history might have foreshadowed that the Majors would return to postseason play in 2025. Page’s teams have made the tournament in 1995, 2005, 2015 and now 2025. This will be the Majors’ ninth NCAA appearance overall, all under Page. The Majors (29-13) travel to Marshall, Texas, for the East Texas Baptist Regional and will face East Texas Baptist (28-14) in the first round Friday at 2:30 p.m. Top-seeded Trinity (36-7) will play Huntingdon (22-19) in the other first round game Friday at 11 a.m.
Belhaven, which lost to Huntingdon 3-1 in its conference championship game, faces Rhodes College (27-16) in the first round of the Edwardsville, Ill. Regional Friday at 2:30. Host Webster (36-7) plays Milwaukee School of Engineering (27-16) in the other first round game. Belhaven is making its first postseason appearance since Mississippi Sports Hall of Famer Hill Denson took them to the NAIA World Series in 2011.



Southern Miss produced two of the five finalists for the Boo Ferriss Trophy, which will be awarded Monday at a luncheon Monday at Pearl River Resort. The five finalists in alphabetical order:

Drake Fontenot (Delta State pitcher): A senior right-hander from Bossier City, La., Fontenot was the Gulf South Conference Pitcher of the Year, sporting a 9-2 record, a 2.23 earned run average, 84 strikeouts and 23 walks.
Luke Hill (Ole Miss third baseman): The Arizona State transfer from Baton Rouge hit .342 with eight home runs and 32 runs batted in.
JB Middleton (Southern Miss pitcher): A former Benton Academy standout from Yahoo City, Middleton likely will be the Sun Belt Pitcher of the Year after producing a 9-1 record, with a 2.0 ERA and 98 strikeouts compared to 22 walks. Middleton is the highest rated MLB prospect among Mississippi college players.
Nick Monstere (Southern Miss second baseman): The former Northwest Rankin standout and Mississippi High School Player of the Year hit .330 with 17 home runs and 61 RBI.

Tommy Tuberville participated in a charity golf tournament in Birmingham Wednesday, just hours before the U.S. Senate was scheduled to take up confirmations of personnel in President Donald Trump’s administration.
Tuberville was scheduled to appear at the 2025 Regions Tradition on Wednesday, a charity golf tournament located at the Greystone Golf & Country Club. Other people scheduled to appear included former Auburn football player Bo Jackson, Auburn head football Coach Hugh Freeze and UAB Head Football Coach Trent Dilfer.
“The senator is in Alabama today for a charity golf tournament that he goes to every year. He is planning to be back in D.C. for votes later this evening,” said Mallory Blount Jaspers, a spokeswoman for Tuberville, on Wednesday.
Tuberville participated in the charity event in 2023 and 2024, which is expected to raise more than $24 million with Children’s of Alabama, a pediatric acute care children’s hospital located in Birmingham.
The U.S. Senate schedule for the day includes a full slate of confirmation votes for senators to consider, including the morning, which Tuberville will likely forego while in Alabama.
The U.S. Senate generally holds a four-day work week, with the first vote on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and the last vote typically taking place Thursday afternoon at 1:45 p.m.
The Senate is set to be in recess for 15 weeks this year, in addition to the regular long weekends. The chamber was set to hold eight votes on Wednesday, including to confirm Emil Michael to be undersecretary for research and engineering at the Department of Defense and for Eric Ueland to become deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget.
Other members of the Senate have missed votes this year, including Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who was in South Korea in late April for the “Our Ocean Conference.” Whitehouse missed a vote on a measure to reject President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. That measure failed on a tied 49-49 vote.
It likely would have been approved had Whitehouse been there. Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who previously indicated opposition to Trump’s tariff policies, also missed the vote.

(Elaine Cromie / Chalkbeat)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
 
Proposed cuts to federal funding for local libraries could end essential services for Michigan students, particularly in rural and impoverished communities, according to state officials.
The Trump administration’s proposed 2025-26 budget would eliminate the federal department that provides funds to state library agencies. The cuts would mean the loss of nearly $4.8 million for the Library of Michigan, as well as grants that support Native American libraries in the state. The funding provides services that support K-12 students, such as early literacy programs, as well as access to the internet, technology, testing materials, tutorials, and online databases.
While most of the state’s library dollars come from local sources, rural, small, and lower-income communities struggle to raise enough revenue to maintain basic services and must rely on federal funds, said Diane Golzynski, deputy superintendent of business, health, and library services for the Michigan Department of Education, during a State Board of Education meeting on Tuesday.
Potential cuts to statewide library services come as the number of school librarians in the state are dwindling and gaps in student literacy achievement are widening.
On March 14, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling to eliminate funding for the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services – the largest source of funding for state library agencies– as well as several other agencies.
Since then, 21 states, including Michigan, sued the federal government arguing the cuts would effectively dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Services and two other agencies. The complaint argues that the executive order violated federal law because the institutions were created and funded by Congress.
A federal judge earlier this month issued a preliminary injunction in the case, temporarily preventing the cuts.
The Library of Michigan recently was notified it will receive federal funding already granted in a contract through the end of September 2026, said State Librarian Randy Riley during the board meeting.
“But after that, everything’s up for grabs,” he said, adding that the cuts proposed in Trump’s budget “would be terrible for what we do.”
Riley said there’s a risk that the statewide public database services the Library of Michigan provides – including the Michigan eLibrary, which gives access to online books, and the Michigan eLibrary Catalog, which lets residents order physical copies of books from collections in other parts of the state to their local libraries – could end or be significantly altered.
Or, the state might need to increase funding for local libraries to replace potential federal funding shortfalls in the future, Riley said.
The role of Michigan’s 397 local libraries in K-12 literacy has become more important over the years, advocates say, as school libraries have become more rare.
The number of school libraries in the state is unclear. However, data on the number of full-time certified librarians employed by districts suggests funding for school libraries has declined significantly in recent years.
The state ranks 47th in the nation for school librarians per student, according to the most recently available data analysis. The number of school librarians in the state dropped 73% between 2000 and 2016 – one of the biggest declines in the country.
Decades of research show access to well-sourced libraries and certified librarians help improve student outcomes.
In a recent national assessment, Michigan ranked 44th in the nation for fourth-grade reading.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)An Upstate engineer announced his bid Wednesday to be the 2026 Democratic nominee challenging U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham.
Lee Johnson, a Greenville businessman, touts on his campaign website a lifetime of “building things from the ground up,” saying he wants to take his commitment to hard work to Washington.
“I wasn’t born into politics. I was born in a construction family, operating heavy equipment before I could drive,” Johnson said in launching his bid to oust South Carolina’s senior senator. “My family taught me how to build things — like roads and bridges — and I’ve carried that with me everywhere: from construction sites and factory floors to boardrooms.”
  Lee Johnson, a Greenville engineer, is a Democrat running to unseat Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2026.
Johnson, like any Democrat in a statewide race in South Carolina, will face an uphill battle. But Democrats’ last attempt to unseat Graham could make that climb steeper.
According to polls in fall 2020, Graham was supposedly in a dead heat against Democrat Jaime Harrison, who became the first U.S. Senate candidate to raise more than $100 million.
Instead, Graham won the nation’s most expensive race ever, as of 2020, by 10 points in a contest that reverberated down the ballot. (Harrison went on to lead the Democratic National Committee.)
Six years earlier, Graham bested state Sen. Brad Hutto by more than 17 points.
Graham, first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002, has become one of the most visible figures in the GOP.
He already received a 2026 endorsement from President Donald Trump, who Graham briefly campaigned against in a short-lived run for president in 2015. The two have had a sometimes-rocky relationship since.
Graham’s re-election campaign is co-chaired by Gov. Henry McMaster and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott.
Yet, he remains divisive.
Trump’s endorsement followed a Greenville Republican announcing a challenge to Graham.
As of the end of March, Mark Lynch, owner of Jeff Lynch Appliance Center, had put $5 million of his own money into his campaign, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.
Several more Republicans could jump in for next summer’s GOP primary, as Graham often draws multiple challengers from his right flank.
But the Senate Budget Committee chairman is a fundraising juggernaut, with $15.9 million in cash on hand, according to his latest FEC filing.
Johnson, who is limiting himself to two terms, pledged to not take any money from corporate political action committees.
“Lindsey Graham built a career for himself,” Johnson said. “I’ve spent my life building for others.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/lindseygraham-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 14:08:35.733013

(Photo by Becca Paschal/Arkansas Governor's Office)President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for Arkansas Tuesday after denying the request last month. 
Federal disaster assistance is available to Arkansans in Green, Hot Spring, Independence, Izard, Jackson, Lawrence, Randolph, Sharp and Stone counties who were affected by severe storms and tornadoes March 14-15, according to a press release issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Tuesday night. 
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-interest loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners with their recovery efforts, according to the release. 
The president issued the disaster declaration after a call with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, according to a statement issued by the governor’s office late Tuesday.
“Our entire state is grateful for President Trump’s leadership and assistance as we recover from the devastating storms that struck Arkansas earlier this spring,” Sanders said. “I had a productive conversation with the President in which he expressed his support for our state and I offered my full endorsement of his plans to reform FEMA to save money and provide greater direct assistance to disaster victims.”

Trump has convened a council to review and recommend “improvements or structural changes” to FEMA, and suggested the agency might “go away.” He has also said states would best take care of disasters on their own, with the federal government reimbursing some of the costs. 
Under Trump, FEMA has denied federal assistance to Arkansas, West Virginia and Washington state, and refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding following Hurricane Helene, according to Stateline.
Sanders requested Major Disaster Relief for Arkansas on April 2. The state received a denial from the federal government regarding Individual Assistance funding through FEMA on April 11, according to the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management. Sanders sent a letter appealing the denial on April 18. 
“Arkansas communities are still recovering from this spring’s tornadoes, as the sheer magnitude of this event resulted in overwhelming amounts of debris, widespread destruction to homes and businesses, the tragic loss of three lives, and injuries to many others,” Sanders said in a statement last month. “To relieve the burden on these counties, cities, and towns, I am appealing FEMA’s decision to deny Arkansas’ Major Disaster Declaration request.”
Individuals and business owners in the designated counties who sustained losses can apply for assistance by registering online, using the FEMA App or calling 1-800-621-3362.

Madison County voters narrowly approved a 1% sales tax to support the maintenance and operation of an under-construction, 148-bed county jail that’s scheduled to be complete in June. Voters had twice rejected a similar ballot measure and barely passed Tuesday’s measure by 16 votes, according to unofficial results. 
The results were “a little bit too close” for Madison County Judge Larry Garrett, who said Wednesday morning he was “relieved” about the outcome, which he anticipated would have a narrow margin.   
“It’s big for our county and it’s going to be big for our future,” he said. “We’re excited to get started down that road.”
Madison County only has a 24-hour holding facility currently, so prisoners are transported and held in other counties around the state, which costs money and manpower, Garrett told the Advocate last week.
Following formal certification of the results by election officials, Garrett said it will be a few months before the county starts receiving the new tax revenue and can hire staff, so the jail likely won’t be operational until December or January.
Two Arkansas counties consider jail sales tax proposals in Tuesday’s special elections

“I appreciate the people of our county stepping up and taking care of business,” he said.
In Pope County, voters rejected an $89.9 million bond issue to support construction of a new facility to house a county jail, 911 call center, the sheriff’s office and the office of emergency management. According to unofficial results, 1,723 people voted for the measure and 1,862 voted against. 
Voters also rejected a 0.75% sales tax to pay off the bond debt with 1,624 people voting in support of the measure and 1,986 voting against it. 
Pope County Judge Ben Cross said Monday he anticipates the issue will be presented to voters again in a couple of years because county government only operates on sales tax and property tax, and revenue is needed to meet the growing county’s needs. 
“The problems don’t go away just because the tax failed,” Cross said. “I would anticipate that a future sheriff and a future county judge will have no other option than to present this to the voters again because we continue to grow and we continue to have inadequate services. So it’s going to be up to the voters to take their security and their safety as a priority.”
County officials started the year with 11,000 active misdemeanor warrants, but because of overcrowding, the current 172-bed jail is only being used to hold felons and people who’ve committed violent misdemeanors like domestic violence, Cross said Monday. Pope County’s population has doubled since the current jail was constructed in 1981, according to county officials. 
Pope County government hasn’t solicited a tax increase in more than 30 years, according to Cross, who said Wednesday he was hopeful that would resonate with voters. However, he acknowledged a variety of factors likely played into voters’ decision to reject the measures, including “the national climate” and low voter turnout. Only 10% of registered voters participated in Tuesday’s elections, according to election officials.
“Ten percent decided for the next 90% what was going to happen,” Cross said. “You’ve got voter fatigue, voter apathy, so it’s just a conglomeration, but there’s no doubt that the national uncertainty of economics plays into everybody’s voting process.”

(Photo from the CDC)The Pittsburgh-area lab responsible for certifying virtually all U.S. government-approved respirators in the country was preparing to shutter for good in June. The Capital-Star reported last month that employees had been told their positions were being eliminated as part of sweeping cuts to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The lab is responsible for certifying and auditing just about every N95, as well as masks worn by doctors, firefighters, welders, coal miners, and other professionals.
But those plans changed Tuesday afternoon. Officials with the local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees union say many, if not all, employees remaining at the Bruceton facility, many of whom were on administrative leave, received an email telling them their jobs were safe — at least for the moment.
“You previously received a notice regarding the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) upcoming reduction in force,” read an email sent to lab employees by Thomas Nagy, the agency’s acting chief human capital officer, and shared with the Capital-Star. “That notice is hereby revoked. You will not be affected by the upcoming RIF.”
The employee who shared the email did so under the condition of anonymity, for fear of retaliation.
But a union official told the Capital-Star between recent buyouts, layoffs and early retirements, it’s been difficult to say with certainty how many employees remain. And with so many on administrative leave, it’s been hard to confirm if anyone did not receive the notification Tuesday.
“We’re still trying to figure out what it all means and who it all covers,” said Suzanne Alison, a steward at the local American Federation of Government Employees chapter that represents Allegheny County’s NIOSH employees. “We’re crowdsourcing a little bit among ourselves.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to detailed questions about the decision to reverse the planned cuts, but said that, “The Trump Administration remains committed to supporting coal miners, who play a vital role in America’s energy sector. Under Secretary [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]’s leadership, NIOSH’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program will continue to meet the needs of our nation’s miners.”
Workers at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab learned their jobs were no longer being cut on the same day a U.S. District Court judge in West Virginia granted an injunction ordering employees of NIOSH’s mine safety and respiratory health divisions return to work following previous cuts. That was in response to a class action case led by West Virginia coal miner, Harry Wiley.
It’s unclear if there was any connection between the ruling and the reversal of cuts to the respirator certification lab. Alison said the ruling likely only affected employees at NIOSH’s Morgantown division, who also faced steep cuts earlier this year.
West Virginia Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito said Tuesday on the social media platform X that over 100 employees would be returning to work at the Morgantown facility.
However, employees at NIOSH’s Pittsburgh-area Mining Research Division, which studies best practices  for avoiding workplace injuries and deaths, do not appear to have received the same notices as those at the respirator certification lab, Alison said.
Kennedy is scheduled to testify Wednesday before both the U.S. House Appropriations committee and the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee to discuss his agency’s proposed budget, which includes drastic staff cuts.
There are two Pennsylvania representatives on the House Appropriations panel, Republican Guy Reschenthaler and Democrat Madeleine Dean.

Members of the state Senate last week unanimously passed a measure that aims to strengthen data reporting requirements for law enforcement.
The bill, introduced in the wake of a false traffic stop probe of the Connecticut State Police, makes intentionally entering false information into a law enforcement record a felony. It also establishes that providing false information is grounds to cancel or revoke a police officer’s certification, and obligates police chiefs to promptly notify state prosecutors if they suspect an officer has engaged in criminal conduct.
Proponents say those measures will enhance police accountability. However, a provision in the bill would also shield more records from disclosure under the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act. That state law guarantees the public the right to view documents such as police misconduct reports.
The bill would create a new FOIA exemption barring the release of any formal complaint against a police or correction officer until it is “investigated and adjudicated by the proper legal authority.”
[RELATED: Several CT bills would limit public access to records through FOIA]
Colleen Murphy, executive director and general counsel of the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission, said the new exemption would erode transparency in the state because it could allow agencies to keep the public in the dark about problems that arise.
“In the realm of complaints against officers, I think sometimes what we’ve seen at the commission is there might be a complaint that’s filed and then it never gets fully investigated, the officer moves on,” Murphy said. “If this were to pass, the public wouldn’t really have any understanding of what the basis was for that sudden departure.”
Bill born out of traffic stop data controversy
Momentum for the underlying bill took hold last year in the aftermath of investigations into faulty traffic stop data provided by state police.
State Rep. Greg Howard, a Stonington Republican who works as a police detective, said he drafted an amendment to the bill in order to protect police who are falsely accused of misconduct from reputational harm.
Howard said he feels lawmakers and news media unfairly impugned the reputations of many law enforcement officers whose inaccurate reporting of traffic stop data was previously called into question.
“I think that public trust in police officers is paramount, and transparency is extremely important, but so is truth,” Howard said. “And transparency of truth and facts is what we’re looking for.”
An audit by the Connecticut Racial Profiling Project raised concern about false or inaccurate racial profiling information provided by 130 current and former state troopers and constables.
An independent investigation requested by Gov. Ned Lamont later found the majority of the troopers are unlikely to have engaged in intentional misconduct, saying most of the inaccurate information was due to mistakes and technical errors.
However, the report also critiqued state police, finding the agency failed to respond effectively when it first learned in 2018 of a handful of troopers who intentionally falsified traffic stop data, or to investigate broader problems in its system.
In response, the governor introduced a bill in 2024 to strengthen data reporting requirements. House Republicans amended the bill to additionally create the new FOIA exemption, which prevents disclosure of pending complaints.
The bill ultimately failed to pass last year, but was reintroduced in the Senate this year. It received a favorable recommendation from the Joint Committee on Judiciary, which heard public testimony in March.
Advocates speak out as Democratic leadership remains silent
The five Democratic co-chairs and vice chairs of the Judiciary Committee did not provide comment for this story. Spokespeople for Reps. Steven Stafstrom and Jack Fazzino said the two men were not available. Sens. Gary Winfield, Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox and Mae Flexer did not respond.
Representatives of the ACLU of Connecticut, the state Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC) and the CT Council on Freedom of Information oppose creating the new FOIA exemption. In written testimony, they argued it would allow agencies to indefinitely withhold records of misconduct, which are of significant public interest.
Staff from the FOIC highlighted the selection process for a new police chief in Hartford. After being tapped to lead the Hartford Police Department earlier this year, a police captain in Philadelphia abruptly withdrew from the position. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported records surfaced showing that he had been accused of sexual harassment.
“Police officers, correction officers, perform a huge public service, and we place so much faith and trust in them, and we rely on them to enforce the laws properly,” said Murphy, the FOIC executive director. “But with that trust, there must be accountability over that role.”
Brian Anderson, legislative and political associate director for AFSCME Council 4, which represents corrections employees and most municipal police officers in Connecticut, said the state has a strong system for investigating misconduct allegations.
He noted that state law makes police officers ineligible to be hired by another law enforcement agency if they retire while under investigation for malfeasance or other serious misconduct.
“We have layer upon layer of examination of police officers to make sure they’re doing their job properly,” he said.

,DC,2025-05-14 16:58:03+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump’s attack on birthright citizenship to be heard by U.S. Supreme Court,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-attack-birthright-citizenship-be-heard-us-supreme-court,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Supreme Court justices on Thursday are set to hear oral arguments in three cases stemming from the Trump administration's attempt to end the constitutional right of birthright citizenship — though the focus may be on the power of district court judges to issue orders with national effects.It’s one of the first major legal fights of the Trump administration’s second term to reach the high court, and one of several immigration-related emergency requests to be considered.The justices have before them three challenges to President Donald Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship, from courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status.But the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to focus instead on whether lower court judges can issue nationwide injunctions, rather than the constitutionality of the executive order. Such injunctions affect everyone in the country and not just those involved in the case or living in the court’s district.It is up to the court alone to decide, though, what it wants to consider, and justices could also wade into the birthright citizenship question.If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than a quarter of a million children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship, according to a new study by the think tank Migration Policy Institute.It would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to the study.The lawyers who will be making oral arguments in court are New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum and Kelsi Corkran, Supreme Court director at Georgetown’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection.In briefs, they argue that the Trump administration has not shown it will be harmed by the multiple district courts placing the executive order on hold.On the core issue of birthright citizenship, in their briefs, they argue that the 14th Amendment “guarantees citizenship to all born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” and cite Supreme Court cases that have upheld birthright citizenship to those born in the U.S.Nine justices, three casesThe nine justices will hear arguments on whether lower courts erred in granting a nationwide pause on the policy that extended beyond the plaintiffs who initially filed the challenge.Immigrant rights’ groups and several pregnant women in Maryland who are not U.S. citizens filed the case in Maryland; four states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon — filed the case in Washington state; and 18 Democratic state attorneys general filed the challenge in Massachusetts.Those 18 states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who will argue on behalf of the Trump administration, has criticized the nationwide injunctions as impeding the executive branch's authority. The Trump administration has contended that it’s unconstitutional for federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions. Instead, the Trump administration said, the injunctions should be limited to those who brought the challenges.Wong Kim Ark caseOn Trump’s Inauguration Day, he signed an executive order, which was originally planned to go into effect Feb. 19, that children born in the United States would not be automatically guaranteed citizenship if their parents were in the country without legal authorization or if they were on a temporary legal basis such as a work or student visa.Birthright citizenship was adopted in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution in 1868, following the Civil War, to establish citizenship for newly freed Black people. In 1857, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, the Supreme Court initially denied citizenship to Black people, whether they were free or enslaved.In 1898, the Supreme Court upheld birthright citizenship, when the justices ruled in United States v. Wong Kim Ark that children born in the U.S. are citizens.In that case, Ark was born in San Francisco, California, to parents who were citizens of the Republic of China, but had a temporary legal authority to be in the country, such as a visa.When Ark left the U.S. for a trip to China, on his return his citizenship was not recognized and he was denied reentry due to the Chinese Exclusion Act— a racist law designed to restrict and limit nearly all immigration of Chinese nationals.The high court eventually ruled that children born in the United States to parents who were not citizens automatically become citizens at birth.In arguments in the lower courts on the current case, attorneys on behalf of the Trump administration argue that the Wong Kim Ark case was misinterpreted and pointed to a phrase in the 14th Amendment: “subject to the jurisdiction.”The Trump administration contends that phrase means that birthright citizenship only applies to children born to parents who are “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. In their view, people in the U.S. without legal status or temporary legal status are “subject to the jurisdiction” of their country of origin.Tribal sovereigntyTribal law scholars have noted that the language pertaining to “jurisdiction of” stems from the idea of political alliance when it comes to tribal sovereignty.It’s from another Supreme Court case involving the U.S. citizenship of American Indian citizens, which the Trump administration focuses on in its argument, citing Elk v. Wilkins in 1884.In that case, the Supreme Court denied citizenship to John Elk, a Winnebago man living in Omaha, Nebraska, on the grounds that “Indian tribes, being within the territorial limits of the United States, were not, strictly speaking, foreign states; but they were alien nations, distinct political communities.”Torey Dolan, an assistant professor of law at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said the Trump administration’s reliance on Elk in its birthright citizenship executive order and the idea the political alliance of a parent would then transfer to a child is a misinterpretation.“A lot of this reliance on Elk is really a distortion,” Dolan said. “I think the administration's reliance is a stretch, at best, and a bastardization of the case, at worst.”Dolan, an enrolled citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, said some Native Americans were excluded from citizenship in the 14th Amendment because during that time, Congress would specifically sign treaties with tribes and grant citizenship.“That is consistent with a long history of Congress creating pathways to Indian citizenship,” she said.After the justices hear arguments on Thursday, any decision is likely to come before the Supreme Court’s recess in early July.",,,,2025-05-14 13:13:31.662954

(Photo: NCGA screengrab)The North Carolina Senate Agriculture, Energy, and Environment Committee voted Wednesday morning to confirm Donald van der Vaart as a member of the North Carolina Utilities Commission, forwarding the resolution to the Senate Select Committee on Nominations.
Appointed by Republican Treasurer Brad Briner, van der Vaart previously served as North Carolina’s environment secretary. He’s a climate skeptic who was considered for EPA administrator during the first Trump administration.
Van der Vaart began his state government career with two decades in the state’s Division of Air Quality. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory promoted him to secretary of the Department of Environmental Quality in 2015, NC Newsline previously reported.
His term on the Utilities Commission, if confirmed, would start July 1 of this year and expire on June 30, 2031.
The Utilities Commission is an agency responsible for regulating the rates and services of all investor-owned public utilities in North Carolina. It’s the oldest regulatory body in state government, according to its website.
At Wednesday’s meeting van der Vaart was asked a handful of mostly friendly questions.
“What specific strategies do you think you’ll employ to ensure your decisions remain impartial, evidence-driven, and resistant to any undue influence from any of the stakeholder groups?” Sen. Buck Newton (R-Greene, Wayne, Wilson) asked.
Van der Vaart said he would rely on the structure that’s currently in place, which includes a “capable” staff that works independently.
“I’m very much interested in using the transparency to the public to provide a forum where free discussions can be not only had, but also viewed,” he said.
He’s faced criticism in the past due to a potential conflict of interest with his wife’s work.
Van der Vaart served as the chief administrative judge on a DEQ dispute over the regulation of a toxic chemical in September. His wife Sandra is chair of the North Carolina Chamber Legal Institute, a prominent lobbying group opposed to PFAS regulation, the Port City Daily reported.
Newton also asked Van der Vaart to share his thoughts on legislation which would eliminate the interim goal for Duke Energy to cut its carbon emissions by 2030.
“A lot of times, goals and mandates get conflated. Do you see this as a goal or some sort of a mandate?” asked Newton.
Van der Vaart said the interim goal does provide the state with “offramps” if things don’t go as planned.
“I think if you look back a little bit into this, you’ll see that some of the load predictions and the requirements that were anticipated in the past turned out to be somewhat inaccurate. Now the 2050 goal appears to be a mandate,” Van der Vaart responded.
Critics of SB 261 have argued that not having an intermediate goal could make it harder to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The bill was fast tracked through the Senate in March, but has yet to see action in the House this session.
Sen. Jay Chaudhuri (D-Wake) joked that van der Vaart may hold the most degrees out of all nominees in front of the legislature: a bachelor’s in chemistry from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a Juris Doctor from North Carolina Central University, a master’s in chemical engineering from North Carolina State University, and a doctorate in chemical engineering from the University of Cambridge.
Chaudhuri also asked what van der Vaart thought was the most important role for the utilities commission.
“The most important role, despite the fact that we regulate a number of utility functions, is to deliver reliable and affordable energy within the confines that are mandated,” van der Vaart said. “We need to work very hard to maintain the affordability of our electricity… If we didn’t have a consumer advocacy function in North Carolina, then we would be ill served.”
Asked about the rising demand for natural gas and pipeline capacity to meet industrial growth, Van der Vaart said this was an issue of critical importance in sustaining the electric grid.
“I think that one of my interests will be to determine and to convince myself that we have the kind of physical capacity and redundancy from a national security standpoint to be able to continue to deliver manufacturing support electricity and various other residential uses of natural gas reliably in the future.”
Environmental groups and clean energy advocates have raised concerns about the build out of natural gas pipelines, amid worries about the impacts on water, air and habitats, and greenhouse gas emissions.

Along with voting to confirm van der Vaart, the committee heard a resolution to approve Reid Wilson as the DEQ secretary, following appointment from Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. This portion was “discussion only” and the panel did not take a vote.
Wilson formerly served as secretary for the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources from 2021 to 2024. Before that, he was DNCR’s chief deputy secretary from 2017 to 2020. He’s been serving as DEQ secretary on an interim basis while awaiting confirmation.

(Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A state Supreme Court ruling Wednesday maintains a six-week abortion ban in South Carolina.
Issuing their third ruling on abortion since 2022, justices unanimously decided state law’s definition of “fetal heartbeat” — the sound of which makes an abortion illegal — applies to when an ultrasound first detects cardiac activity.
Attorneys for Planned Parenthood argued the ban that took effect in August 2023 should apply at nine weeks rather than six, since the heart doesn’t actually form until roughly the ninth week of pregnancy.
Justices disagreed, noting repeatedly that the debate in the Statehouse and prior arguments before the justices themselves referred to the law “consistently and exclusively” as a six-week ban.
“The answer to the question is clear: the General Assembly was referring to the occurrence of electrical impulses that mark the early onset of ‘cardiac activity’ as we interpret ‘fetal heartbeat,'” Justice John Few wrote in the opinion signed by three justices. Justice Gary Hill agreed with the majority but wrote his own opinion.
Like in the law itself, which doesn’t specify a number of weeks when abortion becomes illegal, justices’ ruling does not set a timeline.
But “the biologically identifiable moment in time we hold is the ‘fetal heartbeat’ under the 2023 Act occurs in most instances at approximately six weeks of pregnancy,” Few wrote.
Legislators clearly intended the ban to take effect at about six weeks in a pregnancy, justices wrote.
If that were not what legislators believed the law to be, “it is inconceivable that no member of the House or Senate made any effort to point out that the members of this Court misunderstood the General Assembly’s intent,” Few wrote.
Even legislators opposed to the law indicated they believed it started at six weeks through amendments they proposed. For instance, three amendments introduced in the House during the debate would have held a father responsible for child support starting at six weeks of pregnancy, the point at which legislators believed the ban began.
“While none of these Amendments passed, they each clearly indicate the members proposing them — again, opponents of the Act — considered the 2023 Act to be effective upon events occurring at approximately six weeks of pregnancy,” Few wrote.
Much of Planned Parenthood’s argument centered around the exact wording of how the law defined a “fetal heartbeat.”
A fetal heartbeat, under the 2023 law, is “the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart.”
Those electrical impulses are not “steady” or “rhythmic,” as the law requires, attorneys for Planned Parenthood argued. At that point, the pregnancy is still considered an embryo, not a fetus. And no heart forms until several weeks later in the pregnancy, meaning there is no “fetal heartbeat,” attorneys argued.
But the words “steady” and “rhythmic” have no medical definition, Few wrote.
Legislators have previously used the words “embryo” and “fetus” interchangeably, and attorneys for Planned Parenthood didn’t give an exact moment when the pregnancy changes from one to another. And it’s unclear exactly when a heart is considered “formed,” Few wrote.
One word did have a clear meaning, justices decided.
Under the law, most abortions are no longer legal after “the unborn child’s fetal heartbeat has been detected.” That suggests “an actual, observable event,” Few wrote.
“The only point in the progression of a pregnancy when cardiac activity goes from ‘cannot be detected’ to ‘detected’” is the moment a doctor can hear the electrical impulses that occur around six weeks, Few wrote.
Gov. Henry McMaster praised the state high court’s latest decision as again upholding the law, as justices did in 2023.
“Time and time again, we have defended the right to life in South Carolina, and time and time again, we have prevailed,” McMaster said in a statement. “Today’s ruling is another clear and decisive victory that will ensure the lives of countless unborn children remain protected and that South Carolina continues to lead the charge in defending the sanctity of life.”
Taylor Shelton, the plaintiff in Planned Parenthood’s case, quickly learned she was pregnant but couldn’t get an appointment for an abortion before the six-week cutoff, attorneys have said in court filings. Attorneys argued that Shelton, who traveled to North Carolina to receive an abortion, should have been eligible for one in her home state.
Many people don’t yet know they’re pregnant by six weeks in a pregnancy, said Jace Woodrum, executive director of the state American Civil Liberties Union. Some doctors are reluctant to provide lifesaving care to pregnant women out of fear that they’ll be prosecuted under the law, he said.
Under the law, doctors who violate the ban face the possibility they’ll lose their license, spend up to two years in prison and/or have to pay a $10,000 fine.
“The extreme ban on most abortions is endangering the lives of pregnant South Carolinians and driving medical care providers away from our state,” Woodrum said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_1531-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 13:13:31.662954

Chris Murphy's plans come as President Donald Trump plans to accept a luxury private plane from the Qatari royal family.,"U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) plans to force the Senate to vote on arms sales to any country that does personal business with President Donald Trump’s (R) family. This comes as Trump plans to accept a luxury private plane from the Qatari royal family.
Military deals can typically advance in the Senate without a vote, so long as no member objects.
Following the plane announcement, Murphy said he wouldn’t let certain arms deals go through the legislative body without a fight.
“We should have a full Senate debate and vote,” Murphy said.
Just weeks ago, the U.S. State Department approved a $2 billion arms sale to Qatar. In Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, Trump signed a defense sale worth more than $140 billion.
Trump’s family stands to profit from a deal in the United Arab Emirates, where the president will also visit this week. A UAE venture firm will use stablecoins issued by the family’s blockchain company to pay for a $2 billion crypto exchange investment.
The announcement drove up the stablecoin’s worth.
“Trump’s stablecoin just became the fifth most valuable stablecoin in the world, because of the Emirati investment,” Murphy said.
“Donald Trump is going to the Middle East in order to receive tribute from nations who know the game is simple: if they want favorable treatment from the United States when it comes to our foreign policy, then they don’t have to do anything that supports our own national security,” Murphy said. “They just have to put money in Donald Trump’s pocket.”
Trump has defended the Qatari plane gift, saying it would be “stupid” to turn away a free, expensive airplane.
“I think it’s a great gesture from Qatar,” Trump said. “ I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer.”
Murphy is one of four Democratic senators sponsoring a resolution to condemn the acceptance of the gift. Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), who on Monday did not comment on whether the deal was ethical, would have to call it for a vote.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is also unhappy with the deal.
He said he plans to hold all Department of Justice political nominees until he gets answers from the Foreign Agent Registration Act unit (FARA) on what Qatari foreign agents are doing in the U.S. and whether they’re benefiting Trump.
Schumer also wants to know more about the plane, such as what security measures are already installed, who will pay for its upkeep, and who in the Trump administration made the deal.

While Gov. Healey is right that Massachusetts can't make up the $16 billion in federal funds the state receives annually from the federal government, we have to be prepared to protect our people from the worst of the harm coming from Trump.
The post The Commonwealth has the money to protect the common wealth appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","WHEN I SERVED as the first student member of the Amherst-Pelham Regional School Committee, deep in the 20th century (1983-84), in the aftermath of Proposition 2½, I remember hearing the phrase “tough budget year” for the first time.  I have heard it virtually every year since. I wondered back then: Maybe our state simply does not have enough wealth to support the schools and colleges and communities we want.After 30 years of hearing that austerity mantra, I remember in 2014 reading a Boston Globe article by then-journalist and now Tufts University state policy center director Evan Horwitz, titled “If Massachusetts were a country, how rich would it be?” The answer was that a Republic of Massachusetts in 2014 would have been the fourth wealthiest nation on earth, just ahead of Hong Kong, Sweden, and Switzerland.  It was a stunning revelation about how much annual income is generated in the Commonwealth.Given what we are facing now, we in the Massachusetts Teachers Association thought it useful to ask the question again, to see how we are doing 10 years on.So, how wealthy is the “Republic of Massachusetts” today? The latest available figures from 2023 on income show that a Republic of Massachusetts would still rank as one of the wealthiest nations on earth, with a per capita income of $90,596, a remarkable jump from 2014, when per capita income, adjusted to 2023 dollars, totaled $58,141.  A Republic of Massachusetts today trails only Monaco ($180,080), Bermuda ($130,290), Lichtenstein ($116,440), Norway ($102,910), and Switzerland ($95,070) when looking at per capita income. And even though global income from the same period is measured somewhat differently, adding such factors as capital gains, which are not part of the state calculation, the point is that Massachusetts has the means of a nation to support what the state values.This all matters right now because we know terrible cuts are coming from the federal government.  Between Trump’s mob-like attempts at blackmail – using the threat of withholding federal funds unless we abandon our commitments to educating and celebrating all of our students and telling truthful history – and the commitment to stealing health care from millions on Medicaid in order to fund further tax breaks for the very wealthy, we have to expect a huge budget threat. And while Gov. Healey was right to say, as she did recently, that there is no way Massachusetts can make up the $16 billion in federal funds the state receives annually from the federal government, we have to be prepared to protect our people from the worst of the harm coming from Trump.  (Note that Massachusetts residents and businesses pay over $150 billion in federal taxes every year; we are a “donor” state, meaning we send more taxes to DC than we get in federal spending – to the tune of $46 billion.)And because we are looking at taxable income, Massachusetts does have the ability to buffer whatever blows come from the Trump administration. The real question is whether our state has the political will to take bold action. I believe the answer is “yes.”One practical solution is to have Massachusetts implement the Corporate Fair Share bill introduced by Sen. Jason Lewis and Rep. Carlos Gonzalez. This bill could raise an additional $400 million for Massachusetts by exposing more of the profits a megacorporation stashes offshore to state taxes. Massachusetts currently taxes 5 percent of this so-called global intangible low-taxed income, while other states — and the federal government—tax 50 percent of a corporation’s GILTI. The Corporate Fair Share bill brings us in line with other states.Fair and pragmatic tax policies work.We in the MTA played a central role, as part of the Raise Up Massachusetts coalition, in making our tax system fairer by getting the wealthiest – the half of 1 percent of the wealthiest households in the state – to pay a little more so we can invest in our public schools, colleges, and transportation systems. The voters agreed with us at the ballot in 2022, passing a constitutional amendment that adds a surtax on high earners.Almost everyone – including those who spent millions to protect the uber-rich from paying four cents more on every dollar over the first $1 million in annual income – is thrilled by the $2.5 billion coming in annually to state coffers and being spent on free tuition for community colleges, universal school meals, money for literacy supports, for child care, for aid to middle class school districts, and for improving the T and local roads and bridges, and providing free regional buses.The millionaires and billionaires haven’t left – as too many egg-on-their-face commentators predicted – because Massachusetts is a place those wealthy people want to live – and where they have made money, hand over fist.So, when the federal cuts come and we hear about a really “tough budget year,” and politicians say with conviction that we will have to “tighten our belts,”  let’s instead ask ourselves:  Will we undermine our public schools and colleges, devastate research at our public universities, lay off mental health workers, defund our hospitals, all so that the very, very rich can hold onto their latest round of Trump tax-cut millions? Or will our legislative leaders and our governor make the logical, moral, and strategic decision and mirror the 2022 electorate by passing and signing into law progressive revenue legislation to counter Trump’s draconian maneuvers and maintain our commitments to the quality of life in our state?That is the “Republic of Massachusetts” I want to live in.Max Page is president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association.The post The Commonwealth has the money to protect the common wealth appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240924_132530-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 13:13:31.662954

Marshall Smith for The Marshall Project)Last summer, Kenneth Barrett recalls spending 46 days — about half the summer — in solitary confinement at Algoa Correctional Center, a minimum security prison in Jefferson City. 
In segregation, he was confined to a cell roughly the size of a parking spot for 23 hours a day. Barrett said he had brown tap water to drink, chilled only by the occasional delivery of ice. There were no electrical outlets to plug in a fan, he said. And no escape from his cell except for a warm or hot shower, three times a week.

He said he remembers a correctional officer telling him that it was 107 degrees outside his cell one day, which made sense, because the overhead vents only recirculated hot air. 
Algoa, a nearly century-old facility, is one of four prisons in the state with no air conditioning in any of the housing units, according to the Missouri Department of Corrections. 
As Barrett tells it, conditions throughout the prison are “among the worst” he’s experienced in his more than six years in prison. But it was in solitary confinement where he feared for his life: His cell had no button to push in case of a medical emergency, he said.
On May 12, attorneys with the MacArthur Justice Center, a civil rights legal organization, filed a class action lawsuit against officials at the Missouri Department of Corrections on behalf of people incarcerated at Algoa, alleging that the prison’s “brutally hot” conditions constitute cruel and unusual punishment for those forced to endure dangerous temperatures with little to no relief. 
In interviews with The Marshall Project – St. Louis, and sworn statements to The MacArthur Justice Center, men incarcerated at Algoa, Ozark Correctional Center and Moberly Correctional Center described the effects of unrelenting heat in facilities with limited or no air conditioning. 
Their experiences underscore the unique dangers of extreme heat for people in solitary, also known as administrative segregation (ad-seg for short), or the hole.
Barrett was among nearly two dozen incarcerated men who provided sworn statements in support of the civil rights complaint. Accounts of his experience are drawn from his sworn testimony.
“When medical emergencies like heat stroke occurred, we had to kick on the doors and scream for help,” Barrett wrote in his sworn statement. “Often, it took over an hour for anyone to come. Sometimes, no one came to help.”  
When correctional officers did respond to the noise, Barrett said, officers frequently punished people for speaking up by writing them up for a disturbance. When he experienced his own symptoms of heat stroke — lightheadedness, nausea, and chest pains that made it hard to breathe — he reported himself to medical, but still wasn’t allowed to leave his cell, he said. 
The complaint calls for the Missouri Department of Corrections to develop a heat mitigation plan to respond to future heat emergencies at Algoa, including maintaining a “safe indoor temperature between 65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit” inside every unit in the prison. The new safety plan should also include revised policies for solitary confinement, and for medically vulnerable populations. 
If the state is unable to implement a plan, the complaint argues three of the incarcerated petitioners with less than a year left on their sentences should be released. 
Missouri Department of Corrections Communications Director Karen Pojmann said ice is delivered to restrictive housing units, such as solitary confinement, three or more times a day. She added that Centurion, the prison’s medical provider, has “numerous protocols in place for all institutions” when temperatures rise above 90 degrees, including “additional checks on elderly residents, chronically ill residents and residents taking certain medications.”
However, the accounts of men incarcerated during the summer at several Missouri prisons suggest the state’s heat mitigation efforts have fallen short. 
“Some of these rooms down in ad-seg can get easy triple digit heat indexes for days at a time,” David Blackledge, who is incarcerated at the partially air-conditioned Moberly Correctional Center, wrote using the prison’s email system to The Marshall Project – St. Louis in response to questions about his experience. 
He described a heat so oppressive that it was impossible to get more than 2 to 4 hours of sleep a night. When the ice machines worked, rather than using the ice to cool his water, Blackledge said he would use the ice to chill his bedsheets. “At bedtime I take my clothes off, wrap my body in the frozen sheet, and then mummify myself,” he wrote. 
“I really thought I was going to die from heat stroke last year,” he wrote. “The heat gets so bad it often causes panic attacks. Hallucinations are not uncommon.”

Extreme heat makes being in the hole even worse. The heat is a “compounding force” that exacerbates existing physical and mental health challenges that often come with solitary confinement, according to David Cloud, a postdoctoral researcher at Duke University School of Medicine. Cloud published a study in 2023 on the correlation between extreme heat and suicide watch in solitary.
In Louisiana prisons without air conditioning, Cloud found the rate of daily suicide watch incidents increased by 29% when the heat index reached the “caution” level, defined for the study as 80-89 degrees Fahrenheit. Daily incidents increased by 36% when the heat index reached “extreme caution,” defined as 90-103 F. Since people in solitary have exceptionally limited freedom of movement, Cloud said extreme heat not only can cause physiological harm, but increases the likelihood of “that slow agony of psychological pain.” 
The temperature reached 97 degrees last year in Jefferson City, where Algoa and another state prison are located, according to Extreme Weather Watch, an archive of historical weather patterns. But temperature alone is an incomplete indicator of how hot it really feels in humid places. In an expert report for the civil rights case, University of Arizona postdoctoral fellow Ufuoma Ovienmhada recorded a heat index (a temperature measurement that also includes humidity) of up to 110 degrees outside Algoa some days last summer. She also noted that the temperature inside the prison was likely hotter because the building materials absorb the sun’s heat all day. 
The risk of heat exhaustion is ever-present in prison. The first signs of heat exhaustion include profuse sweating, lightheadedness, clammy skin and a weak pulse. The symptoms can quickly turn to heatstroke. If left untreated, heatstroke can lead to organ failure, permanent neurological damage, and disability or death. The key to avoiding death or long-term injury is to treat symptoms swiftly by cooling the body down externally, and by hydrating with plenty of fluids.  
People in prison don’t have that option, said Dr. Fred Rottnek, former medical director at the St. Louis County jail. The traditional ways to “self-cool” such as taking a cold shower, going to a cooling center or turning on the AC aren’t available. Incarcerated people’s health during a heat emergency is almost entirely dependent on  ”the ability to get help from staffers, either medical or security,” Rottnek pointed out. 
Extreme heat intensified medical and mental health conditions for Allen Fuller, who was incarcerated at Algoa in the summer of 2024. Fuller wrote in his sworn statement that he has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (characterized by symptoms of both schizophrenia and mood disorders such as bipolar disorder) and suicidal tendencies, and also struggles with another medical condition that causes near-daily vomiting.
“I hear voices that get more pronounced when I am hot. My mind starts playing tricks on me,” Fuller wrote. “When I told staff I was hearing voices, they told me to stay under my fan,” he said, adding that he also vomits more frequently in the heat. 
“The staff response to anything seems to be to send people to the hole,” Fuller continued, adding that incarcerated people’s pleas for help are often met with yelling and screaming. “I know we did wrong and that is why we are here, but we are still humans and have rights.” 
Incarcerated people said extreme heat also makes prison conditions worse. In the humidity, beds begin to sweat until they rust. Cockroaches are driven out of their crawlspaces and into people’s cells. Irritability and desperation cause fights to break out over the last cup of ice, or the final spot in the rec room. 
“You just lay in your bunk and wanna die,” Cole Ogle, who is incarcerated at Ozark Correctional Center, another facility with no air conditioning, told The Marshall Project – St. Louis. 
Ogle said the heat at Ozark, a minimum security prison that focuses on substance use treatment, exacerbates an already tense atmosphere. Even the personal fans, available only to a subset of the prison population who can afford them or land a spot in the coveted free fan program, do little but blow more hot air around the cells. The prison often cancels outdoor recreation on the hottest days, Ogle added, even if it’s slightly cooler outside.  
Pojmann, the spokesperson for the Missouri DOC, said in an email that facilities without air conditioning in the housing units “have the means to effectively circulate air through the wings” and keep residents cool using “industrial fans, misting fans, sprinkling stations, cold drinking water and ice machines.”
 If ice machines struggle to keep up with the demand for ice, Pojmann said, “facility administrators are instructed to purchase as much supplemental ice as necessary.” 
While air conditioning might seem like the most straightforward solution to the problem, implementing AC is costly, and not always possible. Prison renovations can cost taxpayers millions of dollars. And some of the oldest prison buildings can’t be outfitted with air-conditioning units throughout the building due to their age, according to Pojmann. 
Incarcerated people report that even these buildings noticeably have air conditioning in administrative offices, classrooms, clinics and other areas where staff work — just not in the housing units where incarcerated people live.
Access to air conditioning can also be weaponized in prison. Ovienmhada, the postdoctoral fellow, who is also one of the lead authors of a national study of extreme heat in US prisons, pointed to examples from incarcerated people she’s interviewed of correctional officers coercively withholding air conditioning, or blasting the AC to dangerously low temperatures as punishment. 
Because these prisons are unable to offer meaningful reprieve from the heat to incarcerated people, Ovienmhada and Cloud have suggested the release of vulnerable people from prison as one solution.
“Building new prisons with air conditioning is not the solution,” said Cloud, the Duke University researcher. “We have to talk about closing prisons that keep people in these types of conditions.”  
The MacArthur Justice Center lawsuit calls for swift policy change at Algoa. Jefferson City has already seen a handful of days in the 80s this year, including a high of 86 degrees in April. Shubra Ohri, one of the lead attorneys in the case, stressed that steadily rising temperatures across the state each summer mean that danger is imminent. A heat emergency could strike in a matter of weeks, she said, and, “Algoa isn’t ready.”
As a minimum security prison, Algoa largely houses people who are nearing the end of their sentences. Because of extreme summer temperatures, some — like Arnez Merriweather, who is scheduled for release in October — worry they may never make it home. Merriweather recently learned his kidneys are failing, which increases his risk of life-threatening consequences from extreme heat.  
“If you want to know what Hell feels like, it is summer at Algoa,” Merriweather wrote in his sworn statement. “I need to survive this summer so I can get home… and I’m terrified of what will happen.”

Sears,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/05/14/maryland-loses-coveted-aaa-bond-rating/,Moody's announced Wednesday that it had downgraded the state's creditworthiness. The change from AAA rating to AA1 means the state — and taxpayers — could pay more in interest on borrowed money.,"State officials, including the governor, Senate president and House speaker, made the state's case last week to bond-rating agencies. (Screenshot from government presentation)Maryland lost its treasured “triple triple-A” bond rating Wednesday when a key bond-rating agency downgraded its assessment of the state’s creditworthiness to Aa1.
The move by Moody’s ends more than three decades in which Maryland held the highest bond rating from the three rating agencies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. Moody’s had given Maryland a AAA rating every year since 1973 — until Wednesday. Prior to Wednesday’s announcement, Maryland was one of 14 states to have the highest rating from the three major agencies — Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poors.
A triple-A rating means the state pays the lowest rates when it sells bonds to fund public projects. The downgrade means the state — and taxpayers — could pay more in interest on that borrowed money.
The change announced Wednesday could mean taxpayers will pay more in interest on the money the state borrows.
The next bond sale is scheduled for June 11.
The rating downgrade was not wholly unexpected.
A year ago, Moody’s reaffirmed the state’s AAA rating, but noted concerns in its report and lowered the state’s outlook from stable to negative. Among those concerns were looming structural deficits driven by programs including the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reforms.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) and legislative leaders this session set about taming a $3.3 billion projected deficit with cuts, cost shifts and $1.6 billion in taxes and fees. But as lawmakers were crafting a budget amid a chaotic first 100 days of the second term of Republican President Donald Trump, Moody’s issued another report seen as a potential harbinger of a rating downgrade.
That report listed Maryland as the state at highest risk for economic problems as a new federal administration set about slashing agency budgets and employment.
Moore, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) took the rare step of meeting in person with Moody’s officials in Annapolis last week, to present a united front as they made the state’s case for a better rating.
Last month, Moody’s downgraded the District of Columbia from AAA to AA1. The firm cited impacts from federal workforce reductions as well as weakening demand for commercial real estate.
Besides Moody’s, which gave Maryland an AAA rating in 1973, Standard & Poor’s first rated Maryland AAA in 1961 and Fitch has given it that raking since 1993.

ChristianaCare has become the first health system in the country to offer a robotics-focused research fellowship led by bedside nurses, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at integrating advanced technology into clinical practice.
On April 30, the health system honored the first four nurses to complete the Nursing Research Fellowship in Robotics and Innovation, a program developed under a $1.5 million grant from the American Nurses Foundation’s Reimagining Nursing Initiative. The fellowship is part of ChristianaCare’s broader three-year study examining the role of collaborative robots in nursing.
Over an eight-month period, nurses from a range of specialties received intensive training in research methodology. Their work culminated in presentations at national conferences and efforts toward academic journal submissions.
The inaugural fellows were Briana Abernathy, Elizabeth Mitchell, Hannah Rackie, and Morgan Tallo — all practicing nurses at ChristianaCare facilities. Their projects explored how robotics could support clinical workflows and reduce strain on nursing staff.

“When you create programs that empower nurses to lead, innovate and tackle meaningful challenges, you see real impact — not just in new skills and knowledge, but in job satisfaction, well-being and retention,” said Susan Smith Birkhoff, Ph.D., RN, who created and led the fellowship as ChristianaCare’s program director of Technology Research & Education.

The fellowship allowed participants to step away from daily clinical duties and engage in hands-on research. While only four nurses were directly involved, they shared their learning with colleagues across the health system, encouraging broader engagement with research and innovation.
The initiative has already gained national recognition. It was highlighted as a model of innovation by the American Nurses Credentialing Center during its evaluation of ChristianaCare, which recently earned its fourth Magnet designation. 
“What makes this fellowship stand out is its focus on giving bedside nurses a real seat at the table,” said Adriane Griffen, DrPH, MPH, MCHES, vice president of programs at the American Nurses Foundation.

“When nurses are trusted to lead and have the right support, they develop solutions that are practical, sustainable and transformative,” she said. “This fellowship shows how nurse-led innovation can grow from a local pilot into a model for improving care across the country.”
Danielle Weber, DNP, RN, NEA-BC, ChristianaCare’s chief nurse executive, said the program reflects the system’s broader commitment to nurse-driven innovation.
“Innovation is about improving care, easing the burdens on our teams and finding smarter ways to meet the complex needs of our patients,” Weber said. “Tools like collaborative robots don’t replace the human touch, they help protect and elevate it.”

The Salton Sea will soon become a major hub for California’s renewable energy economy, prompting the legislature to take steps to ensure future investments benefit local communities that have long been left behind.


The Salton Sea is a haven for wildlife, a repository of critical minerals and the site of some of the worst environmental and economic conditions in California. 
The contrast between its natural riches and its impoverished population has sharpened as companies seek to mine vast deposits of lithium, a mineral used to make batteries for electric cars, computers and cellphones.
“Today, the Salton Sea region stands at a critical juncture with a chance to become a major domestic supplier of lithium,” state Sen. Steve Padilla, who represents parts of Riverside, Imperial and San Diego counties, recently told the Senate Committee on Business, Professions and Economic Development.
The Chula Vista Democrat wants to give the region a bigger say in how it grows amid the projected lithium boom. His bill, SB 534, would create a “green empowerment zone” around the sea that would govern how to use public money, invest in local communities and support the transition to a renewable energy economy.
It would be run by a board of directors with representatives from Imperial and Riverside Counties, local cities, tribal members, energy experts with the University of California and large, private employers.
Padilla’s proposal is modeled after a similar program for the Contra Costa waterfront, which aimed to build on an existing workforce in the renewable energy sector. That program was due to expire in 2028, but two northern California lawmakers are proposing to extend it to 2040, to blunt the economic impact of the Marathon oil refinery closure in Martinez.
In contrast, the Salton Sea proposal in Southern California aims to position an emerging renewable energy industry for rapid growth, and ensure that local residents get a piece of the pie.
Development of lithium mining and other energy projects “could drive regional prosperity, create high paid jobs, support a well-articulated workforce” and boost industry in the desert, Padilla said.
But local advocates say there’s a risk that neighboring communities could be left behind. Most of the region faces poor air quality, high unemployment, an untrained workforce and limited health care access.
The region’s 150,000 inhabitants have also been split along jurisdictional lines. Imperial County communities are lumped in with San Diego, while the Coachella Valley and eastern Riverside County areas are attached to the Inland Empire. But those southeastern desert areas — with low-income, rural, largely Spanish-speaking communities — have more in common with each other than with their respective urban counterparts, the bill notes. Gov. Gavin Newsom last year vetoed a bill that would have created an economic hub similar to SB 534 to help stitch these areas together. 
Padilla acknowledged that the region has often suffered disappointment through “major boom and bust cycles, economic promises that have often failed to deliver sustainable quality of life improvements to the residents and local communities.”
Salton Sea residents and local organizations want to make sure they don’t miss out on the benefits of what state leaders hail as a “white gold” rush in the region.

“The development of a California-based clean energy supply chain in the Salton Sea region that facilitates vocational and higher education opportunities for local residents, in their pursuit of high road quality jobs in the Imperial Valley emerging clean energy sector, is a priority,” said Christian Torres, director of climate equity and resilience for the nonprofit Comite Civico Del Valle. 
The organization has already challenged a Salton Sea project called Hell’s Kitchen, which promised to be one of the world’s largest lithium mines.
Comite Civico Del Valle and the nonprofit Earthworks argued that the company proposing the mine, Controlled Thermal Resources, didn’t fully address the project’s effects on water supply and air quality, and didn’t properly consult with local Native American tribes. A judge cleared the project to start in January, but the groups filed an appeal in March.
Aydee Palomino, an environmental justice project manager with the nonprofit Alianza Coachella Valley, a co-sponsor of Padilla’s bill, said a green empowerment zone would help local agencies collaborate on funding applications and projects and provide “a structured way to ensure everyone has a seat at the table, shares responsibilities, and advances regional priorities,” she said.
It’s part of a broader effort by Padilla to bolster the Salton Sea region. Last year he introduced legislation to create the Salton Sea Conservancy, which will improve habitat around the inland sea, with water features for shorebirds and revegetation projects along its banks. Nearly half a billion dollars in state and federal funds are devoted to that effort.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/020323_Geothermal-Lithium_AD_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 12:20:51.201109

Duke Energy and Dominion, who operate in North Carolina are pushing utility-friendly legislation in Senate Bill 261 — now pending in the North Carolina General Assembly — which would fundamentally change the regulatory approval process. If it passes, North Carolina ratepayers will be required to pay much higher utility bills for decades to come.
If adopted, SB 261 would allow these utility companies to charge their electric customers upfront for the costs of building new plants. You might remember that this practice resulted in dire consequences in South Carolina where ratepayers are still paying for the failed VC Summer nuclear plant.
Here’s how it worked: To pay for VC Summer, the utility company SCANA was allowed to charge its ratepayers using something known as “Construction Work in Progress” (CWIP). That’s what they call the setup where customers pay all the upfront costs to build a new power plant. The entire financial burden and the risks were placed entirely on customers and none of it on utility shareholders. When the VC Summer plant finally went belly-up, SCANA and Westinghouse both declared bankruptcy, SCANA executives were prosecuted and a few even went to jail. Guess who was left holding the bag for the $9 billion failed power plant that never was completed? If you guessed “ratepayers” then you’d be right!
Is this the path North Carolina wants to take?
As a former member of the South Carolina Public Service Commission, I fear that history will repeat itself in North Carolina. These utilities should not be allowed to circumvent the normal regulatory process. My hope is that the North Carolina legislature will keep its longstanding regulatory process in place. It’s worked well for years for North Carolina’s large manufacturers, small businesses and residential ratepayers.
The North Carolina Utilities Commission and the commissioners who serve on it are currently required by law to look out for the best interests of everyone in the state who pays a power bill. Legislative changes that would undermine their ability to do their job should be soundly rejected.
Our existing regulatory process was put in place to protect consumers from utility monopolies who are motivated to increase profits for their shareholders. That is why the North Carolina legislature should continue to rely on the state’s utility commissioners who possess the integrity and impartiality to be fair to all parties.
Don’t make the mistakes that the South Carolina legislature made years ago by passing a law known as the Base Load Review Act. Our South Carolina ratepayers are still paying for those mistakes every month when those utility bills arrive in the mail. Sadly, our ratepayers are now stuck with those high rates for decades to come.
Neighbors are supposed to look out for each other. Your neighbor to the south is warning you that trouble is on the way in Raleigh unless North Carolina senators and House members say ‘no’ to the approach spelled out in Senate Bill 261.
Fortunately, it’s not too late for North Carolina senators and representatives to rethink and reject this approach.

“Public records show that Nevada pet shops import puppies from awful Midwestern puppy mills that no consumer would knowingly support,” testified Rebecca Goff of Humane World for Animals, formerly the Humane Society of the United States, which released an undercover investigation earlier this year that traced puppies sold in Nevada pet stores to puppy mills. 
The bill is named for Cindy Lou, a dog that died after its medical needs were neglected by a Las Vegas pet store, according to the investigation. 
“Breeding dogs are treated like breeding machines with no regard for their wellness,” Goff said of puppy mills. “Under USDA standards, they can be kept stacked in wire cages that are only six inches longer than their bodies for their entire lives. They could be bred repeatedly until their bodies wear out, and then they can be killed.”
Christy Stevens, executive director and founder of Hearts Alive Animal Clinic, says retail puppy stores flout animal welfare laws and were implicated in two forensic investigations and necropsies (animal autopsies) conducted last year by Hearts Alive. 
“In one case, a woman who had been repeatedly sold Yorkie puppies by a pet store was later found to be hoarding animals in appalling conditions,” Stevens told members of the Senate Natural Resources Committee. “Despite the stores knowing that the puppies were dying in her care, they continued to sell her puppy after puppy, Seventeen dead Yorkies were later discovered in her freezers. This is not an isolated incident. It is evidence of a system where profit is prioritized over animal welfare.”
In the second case, authorities found close to 200 dogs, birds, and guinea pigs in a home, hotel room, and vehicle belonging to a Las Vegas couple, and 66 were dead. Dozens of the animals were purchased from the Petland store in Summerlin, where employees were aware of the multiple purchases, testified Gina Greisen of Nevada Voters for Animals. 
But opponents, primarily industry representatives, complained the legislation would unfairly punish all stores, even those that contend they obtain puppies and kittens from reputable breeders. 
“In New York and in California, 93 to 95% of all of the pet stores that were affected and impacted by a pet sale ban closed,” testified Alyssa Miller, a lobbyist for the Pet Advocacy Network, a trade association that represents pet stores. “The idea that someone can just shift a business model is misleading and is also unrealistic.”
PAN is also represented by Nevada lobbyist Alisa Nave, whose family business owns more than a dozen veterinary clinics that serve the same rescue organizations that support the pet store sales ban. Nave declined to comment.
Former Republican State Sen. Warren Hardy, a lobbyist representing Humane World for Animals, told lawmakers that given the failure of the federal government to adequately regulate or shut down puppy mills, there’s no room for compromise. “After 12 years of trying, there’s no middle ground on this. This is our option.”
Eight states, including the entire West Coast and some 500 municipalities,  including Clark County, Reno, North Las Vegas, and Mesquite, have prohibited retail pet sales. 
The majority of pet stores in Nevada, including national retailers Petco and Petsmart, already do not sell puppies, but “thrive as part of the $147 billion pet products and service industry,” noted Goff. 
“We’re in a time when we are cutting government personnel at all levels and agencies,” observed Jill Dobbs, executive director of the SPCA of Northern Nevada. “It is not reasonable to expect there to just be regulations that can be enforced on these businesses.”
The Nevada Assembly approved the measure, Assembly Bill 487, following a hearing last month. Without passage by a Senate committee this week, the bill will die. 
Goff confirms she was told by Senate Democrats to line up the votes to pass the contentious and emotionally-charged measure out of committee if she wanted a hearing. Democratic Committee Chair Michelee Cruz-Crawford, fellow Democratic Vice-Chair Melanie Scheible, and the caucus spokesperson would not respond to questions about the ultimatum, which negates the purpose of a legislative hearing.  
The hearing appeared on the legislative schedule Monday, after inquiries from news media. 
Killing for space
The Animal Foundation (TAF), Southern Nevada’s primary government-supported shelter, announced publicly Tuesday the facility is currently housing more than 1,000 animals, including 547 dogs, and is on the brink of killing animals to make room for more. 
Shelters in the U.S. euthanized more than 1 million dogs and cats in 2016, according to Best Friends Animal Society. Last year, that number dropped to below half a million. 
“Roughly 7 million people in America are planning to acquire a pet this year, and if just 6 percent more people chose to adopt versus purchase their pets, we would end the killing of dogs and cats in our nation’s shelters,” said Julie Castle, the organization’s CEO. 
“We’re in a critical capacity crisis, and are making urgent pleas to the public to adopt and foster,” TAF’s CEO Hilarie Grey told lawmakers. “Right now, we have terriers, Labradors, French and English bulldogs, Aussies, poodles, Cocker Spaniels, even a Papillon.” 
“There’s no need to continue supporting the puppy mill pipeline, but there’s great need for ethical businesses to partner with shelters and rescues to promote adoption while selling pet supplies or services,” Grey testified. “Sign us up. We will gladly bring puppies and kittens.”
Clark County taxpayers spend more than $10 million a year supporting TAF, Commissioner Michael Naft testified, in addition to spending millions more on animal control and code enforcement, “all with the goal of shelter diversion.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Two North Dakota judges have ruled that lawsuits filed by landowners against carbon pipeline company Summit Carbon Solutions can proceed over objections about court procedures.
Several landowners are suing Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions, which is attempting to build a network of pipelines across five states. The pipelines would take carbon dioxide emissions captured at ethanol plants to sites in western North Dakota for permanent underground storage.
Attorneys for Summit had filed motions to dismiss the lawsuits, arguing that not all parties involved were properly notified and that the cases were not filed in the proper court.
Senate passes bill restricting eminent domain for carbon pipelines

South Central Judicial District Court Judge Pam Nesvig issued her ruling Friday rejecting Summit’s arguments in one case in which landowners are suing Summit and the North Dakota Public Service Commission.
South Central Judicial District Court Judge Jackson Lofgren filed a similar ruling Tuesday in another case in which landowners are suing Summit entities and the North Dakota Industrial Commission.
The Public Service Commission in November granted Summit a permit for its pipeline route, about 333 miles through southeast and south-central North Dakota.
The Industrial Commission in December granted permits for underground permanent storage of carbon dioxide in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties.
South Central Judicial District Court Judge David Reich has yet to rule on a motion to dismiss in another case where Burleigh County is suing the North Dakota Public Service Commission and Summit Carbon Solutions.
Among the issues raised in the PSC cases is that the agency did not give enough consideration to the safety of residents along the pipeline route. The lawsuit also challenges the PSC’s ruling that state zoning rules trump county zoning ordinances on pipelines.
The PSC ruled last year that a 2019 state law gives the state the upper hand on pipeline setbacks – such as how far away the pipeline must be from a residence – after Summit said Emmons and Burleigh had passed unreasonable set ordinances.
In the Industrial Commission case, landowners contend the state Department of Mineral Resources withheld information about Summit’s models that would predict where the carbon dioxide would move when the gas is pumped underground. The Industrial Commission oversees the Department of Mineral Resources, which recommended approving the storage permits. About 92% of landowners have voluntarily agreed to participate in the storage facility.
CO2 storage law challenged in North Dakota Supreme Court hearing

In yet another case, the North Dakota Supreme Court heard arguments last month in a challenge to a state law related to underground storage of CO2.
The Northwest Landowners Association and other landowners contend a state law that can force landowners to take part in an underground CO2 storage project through a process called amalgamation is unconstitutional. Summit Carbon Solutions is taking part in the defense of that law along with the state of North Dakota and the Industrial Commission. An attorney for Minnkota Power, who joined the Industrial Commission in arguing to the Supreme Court, said a small percentage of property owners should not be able to deny a majority the right to develop their property.
Summit’s pipelines are planned to connect 57 ethanol plants, including Tharaldson Ethanol at Casselton, to the underground carbon storage sites.
Summit so far has been denied a permit in South Dakota. It has obtained permits in Iowa and for part of its Minnesota route. Nebraska has no state permitting for carbon pipelines.
Supporters of the Summit project say it would support the ethanol industry by lowering the carbon intensity score of the ethanol plants, opening up potential sales in low-carbon fuel markets.
The project would take advantage of federal tax credits promoting carbon sequestration to combat greenhouse gas emissions.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Two foundations in South Dakota’s Black Hills have announced a partnership to support local nonprofits “facing disruptions due to shifts in federal priorities.”
The Rapid City-based Black Hills Area Community Foundation and the John T. Vucurevich Foundation have launched a joint fund, the Sustaining Black Hills Nonprofits Fund, to offer short-term bridge funding. The partnership, also supported by the Bush Foundation in Minnesota, is designed to provide flexible support for nonprofits as they work through changes in their federal support, while encouraging additional community support for nonprofits.


Federal Fallout
Read South Dakota Searchlight’s coverage of Trump administration firings, funding freezes, spending cuts, grant cancellations, tariffs and immigration enforcement.


Many nonprofits are experiencing funding reductions or eliminations since the Trump administration began making widespread cuts in government programs.
Jacqui Dietrich, John T. Vucurevich Foundation president and CEO, said in a news release that “nonprofits are under intense pressure, facing rising costs, increasing demand for their services, and declining federal support.”
“While philanthropy can’t fill every gap, our community can stand together to help sustain critical services through this transition,” Dietrich said.
Chris Huber, Black Hills Area Community Foundation president and CEO, said that without nonprofit services, “our community’s needs don’t go away, they go unmet.”
The partnership has already provided bridge funding to Seventh Circuit Court Appointed Special Advocates, which recently lost $15,000 after the federal government terminated grant awards to the National Court Appointed Special Advocates Association. The program advocates for children in the court system.
Funding has also been provided to Feeding South Dakota and to Working Against Violence Inc., which assists survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.

As a kid, Jeff Isabelle loved reading about dinosaurs. That grew into a passion for fossils, a love of geology, and a desire to work in the field—which meant going to college. Thanks to his parents’ support and his own hard work, with VSAC’s guidance Jeff will go to Norwich with financial aid and scholarships.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Scholarship s[...]","Jeff Isabelle of Barre grew up reading books about dinosaurs. “I’ve been fascinated with paleontology for as long as I can remember. I always hunted for fossils in my spare time, and I’ve found some pretty cool things.” On a vacation to Washington, DC, the family took a side trip to Maryland’s Calvert Cliffs State Park, where Jeff found a bryozoan—an ancient aquatic animal that lived over 500 million years ago. While his longtime hobby connects him to the earth’s distant past, Jeff has also kept his focus strongly on the future throughout his time at Spaulding High School in Barre. Hoping he could go on to college, he worked hard from day one to keep up his grades, and he participated in the VSAC TRIO Talent Search program, a federally funded initiative to help students from modest-income backgrounds apply to and pay for college. Chelsea Martin, one of VSAC’s outreach counselors, worked with Jeff for three years. “Jeff exemplifies TRIO Talent Search. He is a first-generation, modest-income student who put so much work into his academic career to continue pursuing his passion.”This fall, Jeff will study geology at Norwich University. By March, Jeff had earned enough in scholarship awards to cover two-thirds of his college costs. Then, in mid-April, he learned he had won the prestigious Ronald York Scholarship from Spaulding, which further reduced his annual expenses, as long as he maintains a certain grade point average for all four years.“Without Chelsea, I wouldn’t have gotten half of that,” says Jeff—a claim Chelsea Martin pushes back on. “Jeff is one of the hardest workers I know, not only in academics, but outside of school as well.” While Jeff is modest about his achievements, he’s quick to credit hard work, VSAC’s guidance, and his parents’ support for helping him achieve his college dream. “I always wanted to go to college, but to be honest, I wasn’t sure I would be able to,” he says. “I always worked my hardest in school, but I worried I wouldn’t get there. VSAC helped me out a lot by pointing me to schools I could apply to and ways to make college less expensive. And my parents were always right there by my side.”  Jeff’s mom and dad both completed some college courses and understood the importance of education. His two older sisters, ages 28 and 29, both worked with VSAC programs in high school and went on to college and successful careers. His sister Kayla lives in Florida, where she tests soils for contaminants—something Jeff sees as a possible career path—and his other sister Christy lives in New Hampshire and works in cybersecurity.Jeff and his parents homed in on ways to reduce the cost of college tuition. They attended VSAC’s Scholarship Night, where VSAC counselors help students and families set up scholarship applications and navigate online programs. “They showed us how to get through those websites, both during the group presentations and one-on-one.”Jeff says he felt overwhelmed by the number of scholarships available. “It takes a lot of time, and writing essays isn’t easy. But in the end, it is worth it. Even if you don’t get the scholarship, it’s still a good experience.” His search for schools that had dedicated geology programs—which is becoming somewhat of a rare find—led him to Norwich. Other schools on his list offered a major in environmental studies, but Jeff liked the fact that Norwich’s geology program includes weekly trips out into the field, something he knows he wants to do once he starts working. While Jeff’s passion is in earth sciences, some of his favorite courses at Spaulding were in English and history. “I enjoyed classes on graphic novels, medieval studies, and marine biology, and I liked PE, too. Usually the more advanced something was, the more interesting it was.” He also participated in several clubs, including French Club; the SAFE Club, focusing on environmental action; and his favorite, the rock wall climbing club. “That was wicked fun,” he says with a smile.After graduation in mid-June, Jeff plans to return to his usual summer job, doing trimming and maintenance at three local cemeteries, including Barre’s renowned Hope Cemetery. It’s hard work, something Jeff doesn’t shy away from. In fact, having a strong work ethic is Jeff’s advice for those coming up behind him. “Better grades mean better deals for college, so you want to try your best, starting freshman year,” he says. He also encourages students to ask to re-take tests or assessments if they think they can improve their scores—an opportunity he used to his advantage. But hard work is only part of the story. “I’m thankful for my family, especially my mother, who helped me out so much with all the paperwork. I couldn’t have done this alone.”The Vermont Student Assistance Corp. was created by the Vermont Legislature in 1965 as a public nonprofit agency.

StebbinsMichigan’s mandatory 24-hour waiting period for receiving abortions has been struck down after a Michigan Court of Claims judge determined Tuesday that the rule was unconstitutional.
Michigan voters enshrined the right to an abortion and “reproductive freedom for all” into the state constitution in the November 2022 election through a ballot measure. In February 2024, abortion rights groups filed a lawsuit challenging several of Michigan’s provisions around abortion access, asserting that they work against Michiganders’ new constitutional rights.
In addition to the mandatory 24-hour waiting period, Michigan Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel struck down requirements surrounding mandatory counseling that required abortion providers to provide an image of a fetus to patients receiving abortions. Another stricken rule had barred nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives and physician assistants from performing abortions
However, Patel upheld a rule that requires abortion providers to screen for signs of coercion, saying the rule does not violate the constitutional right to reproductive health care.
Michigan voters OK abortion, voting rights and term limits proposals 

“The interest to be protected in this case is the fundamental right to reproductive freedom. The Court has deemed the majority of the provisions in the challenged laws to unconstitutionally burden and infringe upon that right,” Patel wrote in her opinion Tuesday.
Striking down the 24-hour waiting period has been a top priority for abortion access advocates, as Planned Parenthood of Michigan reported in 2023, when lawmakers were considering a repeal, that the rule causes around 150 patients to cancel their appointments each month due to difficulty scheduling with work, transportation or other reasons.
Plaintiffs arguing for the repeal in the case argued that the waiting period does nothing to promote patient health or protect against coercion into getting an abortion. Instead, proponents for the repeal argued that the waiting period works to ensure it becomes more difficult, logistically and medically, to receive quality abortion care earlier in a pregnancy.
“…the Court finds that the mandatory 24-hour waiting period burdens and infringes upon patients’ rights to reproductive freedom,” Patel wrote in her opinion Tuesday. “The mandatory delay exacerbates the burdens that patients experience seeking abortion care, including by increasing costs, prolonging wait times, increasing the risk that a patient will have to disclose their decision to others, and potentially forcing the patient to forgo a medication abortion for a more invasive procedure.”
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a staunch supporter of abortion rights, has long supported eliminating the state’s waiting period placed on abortions, saying in a statement Tuesday that the court’s decision recognizes the struck down provisions as burdensome and obstructive to abortion care.
“This ruling affirms what Michiganders made clear when they voted to enshrine a fundamental right to reproductive freedom in our state constitution: that deeply personal medical decisions belong to individuals and their providers,” Nessel said. “I will continue fighting to defend reproductive freedoms and protect bodily autonomy for Michigan residents.”
Meanwhile, Right to Life of Michigan President Amber Roseboom said in a statement that the court’s decision endangers womens’ ability to make informed and safe medical decisions for themselves.
“Abortion is the only medical procedure of its kind in which the patient now is expected to go in blind,” Roseboom said in a statement. “There is no question that women are at greater risk when they enter an abortion clinic in Michigan today than they were even a few years ago.”
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who championed the effort to remove the barriers, said the ruling “reaffirms that Michigan is a state where you can make your own decisions about your own body with a trusted health care provider, without political interference.”

(Screenshot of livestream)The Indiana Parole Board rejected a clemency plea from Benjamin Ritchie, recommending that Gov. Mike Braun allow the death row inmate’s May 20 execution to proceed as scheduled.
Ritchie, who fatally shot Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney during a police pursuit on Sept. 29, 2000, had petitioned the board to commute his death sentence to life without parole. 
In a letter dated Tuesday, board chairwoman Gwen Horth said the five-member panel had reviewed Ritchie’s application, including “a vast amount of testimony and evidence” regarding his recent diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD), as well as his history of childhood abuse and neglect, and his conduct while incarcerated.

The board also considered the testimony of Toney’s family and friends that was provided during a two-hour public hearing on Monday. 
Horth said the board ultimately found that Ritchie’s request for clemency “does not rise to the level of requiring a commutation of his death sentence.”
She did not say in her letter to Braun if all board members agreed. Unlike in other clemency cases, the board did not take a public vote before issuing its decision.
Annie Goeller, a DOC spokesperson, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that the parole board “decided to make a unanimous recommendation.”
A spokesperson for the governor’s office said Wednesday that Braun “is reviewing the recommendation.”
“By all accounts, Bill Toney was a loving husband, father, and friend as well as a devoted public servant who genuinely tried to do what was best for his community of Beech Grove,” Horth wrote on behalf of the board. She noted that Toney left behind a wife, two young daughters — aged 4 and 18 months — and many close friends, neighbors and fellow officers.  
“The outcome that those individuals were promised by a jury of Mr. Ritchie’s peers was that Mr. Ritchie would ultimately be put to death for his egregious actions,” Horth continued. “The family and friends of Bill Toney have patiently waited for the day when that sentence would be fulfilled.”
Story continues below.
Ritchie-Recommendation
 
Ritchie, now 45, has been on Indiana’s death row since his 2002 conviction. 
During his first clemency hearing, held at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, Ritchie admitted for the first time that he had intentionally fired the fatal shot and left the officer to die.
“Mr. Ritchie himself has given multiple versions of the events that transpired,” Horth wrote. “However, during his hearing on May 5, 2025, Mr. Ritchie did admit to being in a stationary position and intentionally shooting Officer Bill Toney.”
At the time of the shooting, Ritchie was in violation of probation for a prior burglary conviction, Horth noted. His record also included a series of juvenile delinquency findings that led to his incarceration as a minor.
And although some former corrections officers praised Ritchie’s behavior, the parole board’s review emphasized that Ritchie has accumulated more than 40 conduct violations during his two decades in prison, some of which involved violent or threatening behavior toward officers and other inmates. 
Advocates for Ritchie argued that his FASD diagnosis — a condition linked to cognitive impairments and behavioral challenges — should disqualify him from capital punishment, especially when combined with his abusive upbringing and lead exposure as a child.
‘A monster running loose in the countryside.’ Clemency hearings end for Indiana death row inmate

Still, Horth said the board believed those factors had already been weighed by judges and juries over the course of years of legal proceedings.
“We find that a vast majority of the information related to Benjamin Ritchie’s history of abuse and neglect, including but not limited to pre-natal alcohol exposure, has been appropriately considered by the fact finders and judicial officers tasked with considering the evidence,” she said in the board’s letter.
A final clemency decision now rests with Braun. The governor can accept the parole board’s recommendation, or elect to commute Ritchie’s death sentence to life imprisonment. There’s no timetable for the governor to issue his opinion.
Without clemency, Ritchie is unlikely to succeed in challenging his death sentence.
The inmate’s lawyers are seeking a last-minute execution pause from the U.S. Supreme Court, in addition to an emergency stay from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. Both filings are still pending.
The Indiana Supreme Court already denied a stay.
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976.
The most recent was in 2005, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels commuted the death sentence for Arthur Baird, who killed his pregnant wife and her parents in 1985. Although the parole board denied his petition for clemency, Daniels granted Baird clemency one day before the scheduled execution, in part citing questions about Baird’s sanity.

Lovett's controversial bill to erase the property rights inherent in faculty tenure didn't gain traction during the 2025 session of the Kansas Legislature. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Emporia State University general counsel who championed a bill introduced in the Kansas Legislature to abolish property rights inherent in university tenure agreed to leave the state payroll to become a legal consultant to the university.
ESU President Ken Hush said in a campus message that he looked forward to working with Steve Lovett after transitioning to a new role as “third-party legal consultant for the university.” Lovett will be counted on for legal, strategic and leadership services, Hush said.
“We continuously seek opportunities to be innovative and find new ways to create efficiency,” Hush said. “This approach provides flexibility for ESU and reduces overhead costs.”
Lovett played a central role in a controversy that erupted in February when a bill — purportedly introduced without the knowledge of ESU or the Kansas Board of Regents — was filed in the House to retroactively gut tenure rights of nearly 3,000 public university faculty in Kansas.
Lovett’s bill raised red flags because it could have influenced outcome of a lawsuit filed by a group of ESU faculty who were fired in 2022. In a key decision, a federal judge said tenure in Kansas contained a property right. Lovett was listed among defendants in that federal case and his advocacy for the legislation could be viewed as a conflict of interest.
During testimony to a House committee, Lovett said the property right woven into tenure was an “unnecessary impediment” at public universities. Lovett renounced tenure awarded him by ESU as an associate professor.
Blake Flanders, president of the Kansas Board of Regents, said legislative proposals from state universities such as ESU had to be approved by the Board of Regents prior to being submitted to the Legislature. He indicated Lovett’s bill violated Board of Regents’ policy.
The bill was a “surprise to the university” and Lovett lobbied for the legislation as a “private citizen” rather than in his capacity as ESU’s top attorney, a ESU spokeswoman said.
Academic leaders of Kansas State University and University of Kansas argued implementation of Lovett’s bill would lead to an exodus of educators and students, destroy academic research programs and harm the state’s economy.
The office of Attorney General Kris Kobach said $250,000 would be needed in 2026 and 2027 to defend the state against legal challenges if the tenure bill became law. The measure didn’t advance out of a House committee.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lovett-1b-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-14 11:04:16.000020
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-14 14:45:50+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Three strikes and you’re out’: Jackson State alums and lawmakers urge transparency with IHL board,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/14/three-strikes-and-youre-out-jsu-alums-lawmakers-critique-ihl-board/,Graduates and Mississippi lawmakers of the state’s largest historically Black university say they’re frustrated with the college board after JSU's third leadership turnover.,"After Marcus Thompson’s resignation last week, Mississippi lawmakers and Jackson State University alumni are calling for more transparency and accountability from the state’s governing board that oversees and selects its college presidents. 
The Institutions of Higher Learning Board met in a closed door executive meeting for two hours last Wednesday to discuss a personnel matter regarding the job performance of an employee at the state’s largest historically Black university – the second time in three weeks the board did so. After the meeting, board officials told media there was nothing to report. 
IHL later released a statement saying Thompson resigned, but provided no information about what happened or why. Mississippi Today asked for a resignation letter but due to state public record laws it cannot be shared publicly. A spokesperson for the board said in an email statement they requested permission from Thompson to release his letter but the request was denied.

Thompson’s departure officially marks the university’s third leadership turnover in ten years. It was deja vu for many who had watched the board let Thompson’s predecessor, Thomas Hudson, resign two years ago with no public explanation. 
The news came as a disappointment to JSU alumni, including Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson. Speaking about the repeated resignations creates a double-bind for JSU alums: It can bring unwanted, negative attention to the university, but staying silent could lead to IHL repeating the same mistakes.
“We got a lot of great things going on at Jackson State University,” Bell told Mississippi Today in a phone call this week. “It just speaks again to the need for transparency and accountability through the presidential selection process and IHL.” 
In 2020, Bell was one of 10 Democrats who introduced a bill to abolish IHL. The bill would have allowed the state’s eight public universities to appoint their own board of trustees to oversee the universities finances and executive leadership. The board is currently appointed by the governor with the advice-and-consent of the Senate.
If established, each 12-member board would include three representatives from the following groups associated with the respective university: members of college alumni association, student government and university faculty senate and state residents to serve a five-year term. It would have also established those boards to keep a detailed history of meeting minutes and vote history of potential candidates. 
The bill was tripled-referred, a rare legislative tactic used by House Speaker Philip Gunn at the time, to ensure the bill’s death. 
A dog and pony show
Mississippi Today reached out to Jackson State University National Alumni Association President Patrease Edwards for a comment. 
Leaders of the group did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication but shared a statement with other publications that in part asked alumni to only speak positively about the university. 
Mark Dawson, a lifetime member of JSU National Alumni Association, was one of many who sat on an open panel for the university’s presidential candidate process in spring 2023, which ultimately resulted in Thompson. 
Dawson said it did not seem like IHL took the panel’s feedback into account. Rather than using alumni on these panels as a “dog and pony show,” Dawson said, there’s a need for a “unified approach” for stakeholders and supporters of the university to be more involved in the search — so they can help IHL select a president who will last more than a couple years. 
“It’s about the opportunity to come together and get some things right,” Dawson said. “How can you have a vision for long-term stability for student housing, fundraising, academic programs and a new stadium when you have a new administration every few years. It needs to be corrected.” 
Sen. Derrick T. Simmons Credit: Aallyah Wright, Mississippi Today
State Senate Minority Leader, Derrick T. Simmons said the board’s lack of diversity hurts JSU. The state’s 12-member board currently only includes one alumnus from a Mississippi HBCU. While the state’s population is majority African-American, JSU and other universities play a pivotal role in educating Black professionals, many of whom are Mississippi natives, Simmons added. 
“This underrepresentation raises concerns about equitable decision-making and inclusivity,” Simmons said. “By embracing these principles, the IHL can better serve all Mississippians, uphold the legacy of its educational institutions, and ensure a more equitable future for higher education in the state.” 
Sen. Hillman Frazier, D-Jackson, said he doesn’t have confidence with IHL when it comes to selecting the university’s presidents. In the last three presidential processes, the board has continued to overlook recommended resumes, stakeholders and supporters choices for president. 

Sen. Hillman Frazier, D-Jackson, is a JSU alumnus
Hudson’s predecessor, William Bynum, was gone after three years following his arrest in a prostitution sting at a Clinton hotel. Bynum was appointed Jackson State’s president in 2017 after serving as president of Mississippi Valley State University president for about four years.  He was not a popular pick. The board’s announcement of his selection inspired several Black lawmakers to file a lawsuit to prevent his appointment. 
“They’ve wasted taxpayers and the JSU family’s time, energy and resources,” Frazier said. “Three strikes and you’re out. I have no confidence in this board and its commissioner.” 
A spokesperson for the board said the trustees have not held any formal discussions regarding a presidential search for Jackson State University.  
“The Board of Trustees is committed to a clear and transparent process,” a spokesperson for the board said in an email to Mississippi Today. 
IHL hired Thompson in November 2023 after Thomas Hudson. The board had placed Hudson on administrative leave, but did not share with the public the reason for the personnel issue that motivated its decision. 
When the board began its search a few months later, members of the JSU community asked the board to “stop hiring your friends.” The board conducted a national search, interviewing 79 applicants, but Thompson was the epitome of an internal hire having worked at IHL since 2009. 
Moving forward 
Denise Jones Gregory, former provost of vice president of academic affairs at JSU, shared a personal statement  on the university’s social media this weekend. 


“I ask for your patience, your partnership and most of all, your prayers as we move Jackson State University forward together,” Jones-Gregory said. 
Lisa Ross, a Jackson-area employment attorney and JSU alumnus, said IHL needs to better prepare the presidents to lead a complex organization like a university. She would know: Ross has repeatedly sued IHL and JSU on behalf of female administrators and faculty who have alleged gender discrimination in the workplace from male superiors.
Ross, who has sued over Thompson and Hudson’s appointments, noted neither man had led a university before IHL selected them. 
“It seems like they’re sending these people over there and they’re just letting these people go,” she said. “I don’t know if they gave Marcus the support that he needed.”
Ross cited something Thompson told her soon after he became president, that he had never read “To Survive and Thrive: The Quest for a True University.”
The memoir recounts John Peoples’ time leading Jackson State amid civil rights demonstrations and the 1970 shooting, as well as his relationships with the IHL board. Peoples is widely regarded as the university’s most renowned president.
“He did tell me ‘oh, I went out and bought the book,’ but you don’t even know the history of the university?” she said.
Going forward, the repeated resignations could make it hard for the state Legislature to invest in the university. It could also lead to a less qualified candidate pool, Frazier added. 
“This turnover is going to have a chilling effect on someone who wants to apply for the job,” he said. “It’s sabotaging the growth and reputation of my alma mater.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Several environmental groups declared victory in an ongoing rulemaking process to expand the uses of oil and gas wastewater beyond the oilfields, after the Water Quality Control Commission during a Tuesday hearing reversed its position to allow releases into the environment.
“We’re so delighted that the commission took their responsibility so seriously and applied science and applied the law,” New Energy Economy Executive Director Mariel Nanasi told Source NM after the meeting. “There’s no evidence that produced water can be treated and reused safely; without knowing what needs to be removed from produced water, it is impossible to develop treatment standards or assure the public that discharges will be safe.”
The substantial shift comes just 10 days before the WQCC has to issue a final decision in the yearslong and controversial effort to treat and potentially reuse oil and gas wastewater.
The process began in December 2023 when the New Mexico Environment Department petitioned the commission to adopt rules to expand reuse beyond oilfields. That process included weeks of testimony in 2024 from scientists, water experts, environmental officials and industry representatives.
Scientists project that drought and warming temperatures from human-caused climate change will reduce New Mexico’s water supplies by 25% in the next three decades, and place more strain on rivers and aquifers. For the past several years, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has proposed a so-called Strategic Water Supply that would treat and use oil and gas wastewater to compensate for those losses. However, lawmakers in the most recent legislative session stripped produced water from the final bill. Opposing water and conservation groups said treatment technology for the water remains unproven and the waste poses harm to human and environmental health.
The New Mexico oil and gas industry generates billions of gallons of wastewater. The mixture is extremely salty and can contain radioactive materials, heavy metals, toxic chemicals and cancer-causing compounds from the oil and gas, such as benzene.
The reversal
In April, the commission adopted a draft version of the rule that would allow pilot projects using oil and gas wastewater to discharge up to 84,000 gallons per day into groundwater.
Environmental groups New Energy Economy, WildEarth Guardians, Amigos Bravos and the Sierra Club submitted several arguments that the decision violated existing laws; was not based on previous testimony; and potentially threatened human and ecological health. More than two dozen Democratic lawmakers also weighed in last week, urging the Water Quality Control Commission to reconsider.
Lawmakers urge water board to reconsider produced water rule

On Tuesday, WQCC members acceded to those arguments.
“At this point, I believe it’s premature for us to authorize discharge permits, even for pilot projects,” said Commissioner Bill Brancard during deliberations.
Commissioners did not allow attorneys for the environmental groups, nor ones for the oil and gas industry, to make oral arguments on Tuesday, but instead deliberated for several hours. The vote was unanimous, although two commissioners abstained, saying they had not been present for testimony in 2024, did not feel informed enough to cast a vote.
About 30 people attended the Roundhouse hearing, displaying signs stating “No discharge of fracking waste” and “Water is life,” prompting warnings from two Sergeants at Arms to keep signs outside the meeting room. When commissioners voted to strike discharges from the rules, attendees applauded.
“Fracking waste is by no matter a light concern,” Ennedith López, a policy campaign manager at Youth United for Climate Crisis Action (YUCCA), told Source before the vote. “It’s radioactive wastewater that they want to use potentially for agriculture projects for construction and development, and that comes at the harm of people’s health.”
Commissioners also determined that state law mandates that using produced water would most likely require a permit, which would be more stringent than the process in the draft rule.

At one point, commissioners floated scrapping the entire process, which would send the New Mexico Environment Department back to the drawing board, but decided instead to add language requiring pilot projects to seek permits.
Deliberations Wednesday will include more information about what information pilot projects would need to require for permitting, and if the rule needs to be revisited in the future.
Attorneys for New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, which is also party to the rulemaking, declined to comment Tuesday.
Produced water proponents said they were disappointed with the commission’s decision Tuesday.
Restrictions on discharges will push produced water treatment to Texas, said Mike Hightower, the program director at the Produced Water Consortium, a private-public research group.
‘With no discharge, all the companies that want to discharge the water for beneficial use: agriculture, surface water, putting water in Pecos for ecological flows, can’t do that here, so they’ll go to Texas” Hightower said.
He also said a permitting process would increase the time needed for approval on pilot projects.
“Nobody’s going to do a small pilot project that takes a year and a half to get permitted when they can go to Texas and get it with no permit or a permit that takes a couple of weeks,” Hightower said.

A former middle school principal in Delaware has been indicted on multiple felony charges, including rape and child sexual abuse, following allegations she assaulted a minor over several years while holding a position of authority.
Tasha Purnell, who was known professionally as Tasha Oliver during her time as principal at Alexis I. du Pont Middle School in Wilmington, was indicted in August on 19 felony counts.
The charges include third- and fourth-degree rape, continuous sexual abuse of a child, and sexual abuse of a child by a person in a position of trust.
Court documents allege that between August 2010 and July 2014, Purnell abused a female victim—identified in legal documents only as D.B.—while serving as a teacher at Stanton Middle School in New Castle County.
The victim was under the age of 16 at the time.
Purnell, 43, became principal at Alexis I. du Pont Middle School in January 2020. She went on administrative leave in September 2023. and the assistant principal stepped in to lead the school.
Purnell was officially terminated a year later, but records show she continued to receive her full $142,000 salary during that time.
As of now, school district officials have not responded to requests for comment.
Purnell taught at Stanton Middle School from 2006 to 2016, the same period during which the abuse allegedly occurred. Her indictment marks a rare and serious case involving a high-ranking school official in the state’s education system.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tasha-oliver.webp,,,2025-05-14 11:04:16.000020

Jared Polis to sign Senate Bill 25-5, the Worker Protection Act on Tuesday. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado labor unions rallied outside the governor’s residence in Denver on Tuesday, making one last appeal to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis to sign into law a bill passed by the Legislature to repeal a unique obstacle in state law for workers seeking to form a union.
“There is broad support for this from every corner of the state and everywhere in between,” state Sen. Jessie Danielson, a Wheat Ridge Democrat and sponsor of Senate Bill 25-5, told a crowd of a few dozen advocates in Governor’s Park. “The public wants it. The workers need it. It’s the right thing to do, and the time is now. Gov. Polis, sign the Worker Protection Act into law.”
But Polis is expected to veto the measure, siding with business groups who want to preserve the state’s 80-year-old Labor Peace Act. Under that law, Colorado workers organizing a union must hold a second election and obtain 75% approval to determine if workers who don’t support the union would have to pay representation fees, a modified version of the so-called “right to work” rules enacted by many conservative states.

With a veto expected, supporters of SB-5 are instead turning their attention to the ballot box, where they hope to make gains on a different policy front in 2026. Initiative 43, a proposed ballot measure filed earlier this year, would require “just cause” for employee terminations, a significant change to the state’s at-will employment laws.
The measure would require private-sector employers to provide notice of 1 of 7 causes for termination, including willful misconduct, gross insubordination or “specific economic circumstances that directly and adversely affect the employer.” Fired employees who don’t believe their terminations met the just-cause criteria could file civil actions in state court seeking reinstatement or other relief.










The public wants it. The workers need it. It's the right thing to do, and the time is now. Gov. Polis, sign the Worker Protection Act into law.


– State Sen. Jessie Danielson


The initiative was approved for circulation by the state’s Title Board last month, and advocates began gathering petition signatures at Tuesday’s rally. To qualify for the 2026 ballot, the campaign will need to submit at least 124,238 valid signatures from registered Colorado voters before an Oct. 24 deadline. As a statutory measure, it would become law with a simple majority vote.
The Colorado AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union Local 105 and United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 are among the unions backing Initiative 43.
“At a moment when the nation has recognized that corporate billionaires are rigging the system against us, Coloradans came together to build solidarity, worker power and a fairer vision for our future,” Kim Cordova, president of UFCW Local 7, said in a statement. “This legislative session was the opportunity Colorado’s labor movement needed to build the power needed to pass pro-worker policies, whether through legislation or at the ballot.”

Chris Deluzio announces his intention to seek a second term during an event in Collier Township on Tuesday, Jan. 23, 2024. (Steve Mellon/For the Penn Capital-Star)U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio’s (D-Allegheny) successful reelection campaign was one of the lone bright spots for Pennsylvania Democrats in 2024. Republicans in the Keystone State carried the commonwealth’s 19 electoral votes which helped propel Donald Trump back into the White House; Dave McCormick unseated the longest serving Democratic senator in Pennsylvania history, Bob Casey; GOP candidates won all three state row offices (attorney general, auditor general, and treasurer), and flipped two U.S. House seats in the process. However, Deluzio’s victory in a battleground district over GOP state Rep. Rob Mercuri earned him a second term.
He represents a purple region in western Pennsylvania and penned an op-ed in the New York Times in March saying “anti-tariff absolutism is a mistake.” Deluzio recently joined U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders to speak at rallies in Harrisburg and Bethlehem along the Vermont Independent’s “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, and NBC News reports that he’s viewed “as someone who could be a future statewide candidate” in Pennsylvania.
As Democrats continue to chart a path forward to better connect with voters, Deluzio spoke with the Pennsylvania Capital-Star about President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, focusing on economic populism, joining the “Monopoly Busters” caucus, and more. 
This interview was edited for length and clarity:
Capital-Star: ​​In November, you were elected to serve your second term in Congress. What are your priorities for this session?
Deluzio: Well, I think we still have a big opportunity to pass my Railway Safety Act and get rail safety done. 
This is, I think, an urgent priority for so many of my constituents and people like us who live close to the tracks.
And I always bring out this point: I think my Railway Safety Act may have been the only bill that Joe Biden and Donald Trump both agreed about and supported as they were running for president.
Senator Vance was even one of my co-sponsors in the Senate.
So, I think it’s something we can get done.
I also want to be clear, the railroads continue to lobby hard against rail safety efforts.
There’s reporting, even this last week, that they are pushing the Trump administration to roll back the two person minimum staffing requirement that the Biden administration had put out.
And so, I highlight that to make the point that the powerful railroads do not want to see us succeed to get rail safety passed.
I think we’ve got to do it to keep us safer from derailments like East Palestine.
  A Norfolk Southern Railway train derailed in East Palestine, a town of nearly 5,000 residents, on Feb. 3, 2023, leading to the release of dangerous chemicals through a controlled burn to prevent an explosion. It forced residents to evacuate the area. A bill that includes tax exemptions for relief payments related to the disaster passed the U.S. House with bipartisan support. (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency)
I also get to a problem I see that is bigger than just one bill.
I’m 40 years old, so people my age, around my age, and younger, you know, we’re the first Americans, really, since the Second World War, that the data says you shouldn’t expect to be better off than your parents and that’s really unacceptable to me.
I think that goes to the heart of the American dream.
I think corruption has had such a big impact on why you have such a corporate stranglehold in our economy, why growth struggles, why people can’t make ends meet.
And so, I want to take on that corruption, I’ve been working on congressional stock trading bans.
I’ve got a whole defend democracy agenda around combating corruption, so I’m really going to keep pushing on that. I think it’s such a major problem, not just for our economy, but for people’s trust in our government.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Capital-Star: President Donald Trump’s tariff policies have played a significant role in his second term, thus far. I know most Democrats have been vocal against Trump’s tariffs policy. I know you’ve criticized it at points in time as well, but you did pen an op-ed in the New York Times saying that it was time for Democrats to “rethink our stance on tariffs.” 
So I want to ask you, do you think Democrats are making a mistake in how they’ve talked about tariffs during Trump’s second term thus far?
Deluzio: I think the Trump tariffs have been really bad and hurtful to American workers and industry, and I think Democrats have been nearly unanimous in condemning them. 
And you’ve heard from so many in the business world about how harmful they have been.
What I’d like to see is a strong Democratic alternative that yes, will include some targeted enforcement.
I’m thinking strategic sectors like ship building or steel against trade cheats like China, paired with real and meaningful industrial policy here at home. That means incentivizing companies to bring that production back home, to incentivize investment from friendly countries to invest here in America and American assembly lines, and you’ve got to be focused on parts of the economy where there is a national security impact: semiconductor chips was a good example. But we should be thinking about that for steel, for ship building, and any other sector where we need a strong industrial base.
I serve on the Armed Services Committee. I will tell you there is round agreement and concern about our defense industrial base’s ability to ramp up, if, God forbid, we’re ever in another major war.
And so these issues of our manufacturing power are not just some academic debates. They have real consequences for our military readiness, and of course, I always connect the dots between what happened in places like western Pennsylvania, whether you’re talking about glass manufacturing in the A-K Valley, steelmaking all along the Ohio River in my district.
Trade really hurt communities, like many that I represent, and I don’t ever want to see us go back to just a race to the bottom. We’ve got to get this right for American workers and American jobs. 
Capital-Star: Earlier this month, you joined U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for two of his appearances on his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour in Pennsylvania. So, why did you decide to join him for those events that were outside of your district?
Deluzio: I think what you’re seeing is a lot of frustration with some Republican members of Congress. Scott Perry’s district was one in particular, I joined, for their willingness to push these dangerous and harmful cuts to Medicaid to support this Republican, partisan tax bill that would saddle all of us with trillions of deficit spending and balloon the debt.
And I think it’s important.
Folks are pretty fired up across the country.
They’re mad about this corruption that I see in our government, and whether it’s congressional stock trading or the outsized influence of corporate money in our politics. They want something to change.
And I made the point talking at both of these rallies that whether you call the folks who are running the show oligarchs or robber barons, or, as I might say in western Pennsylvania, corporate jagoffs. We know who we’re talking about and their control of our political system.
That’s not a problem just for one party or one candidate. I think you have to confront this for the sake of American democracy and I’m going to go wherever I can at the means we’re going to rebuild trust in our government, and if we’re going to fix our economy, so that people who work hard can get by.
And to me, that is about making sure that hard working people have a bigger share of the pie and that we can also grow the pie.

Capital-Star: Do you think Democrats should be embracing more of the message from Senator Sanders or someone like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez right now?
Deluzio: I think the message that I put up on that stage both nights, which was about fighting oligarchy and fighting corruption, is a winning one. 
It is grounded in patriotism. It is grounded in a belief that if you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to have a shot at the American dream, and we’ve got to unrig our economy, so that it works for folks.
That is a message that is not just good politics, but it’s grounded in policies that people want, that we know can work to get more competition in our economy to make it so that people who are working hard can afford their life.
I think that’s where my party should go.
Capital-Star: Although I was unable to cover your appearance with Senator Sanders in both Bethlehem and Harrisburg, I did cover Senator Sanders’ appearance in Philadelphia on May Day. He spoke at a rally led by the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, and during that speech, he had an interesting quote, and I wanted to ask you about it. He said “to my Democratic colleagues in the Congress, stop defending the status quo economically.” 
Do you think Democrats have been defending the status quo economically?
Deluzio: I certainly haven’t, because I know, and I think my constituents know that things haven’t been working out as well as we should demand that they do.
If you’re my age or younger, right? So, you’re either (in your) early 40s, 30s, 20s, the data suggests you probably won’t be better off than your parents.
We should never accept that, and we should be clear about the fact that people who are working hard right now struggle to pay for child care, pay for housing, pay for health care, you name it.
And we’ve got big corporate monopolies who have made it too hard for small businesses to compete.
None of that should be the status quo we accept, especially when we’ve lived now through years of supply chain problems and rising prices for people.
So no, I don’t accept that and I think we have to be clear to connect the dots between those economic problems and the corruption in Washington.
And I talk to my constituents, Democrats or Republicans, they hate the corruption that they sense, and congressional stock trading is part of it. I think the Trump administration’s willingness to do things like accept a new massive jumbo jet from a foreign government is about this kind of corruption, and so people don’t like it, and they shouldn’t like it.
They should be mad about the state of our economy, and they should want better and I think they do.
And whether you’re Democrat or Republican, we should be willing to be clear about who’s causing these problems and what we’re doing about it.

Capital-Star: Last month, you joined a few of your colleagues in launching the Monopoly Busters Caucus. So, I wanted to ask you, why did you decide to join this caucus?
Deluzio: Well, I think we’ve seen the lack of competition really hurt American capitalism.
It’s bad for workers. It’s bad for rising prices, and it’s really bad for small businesses.
So, I was really honored that I had a couple small business owners join me, a father-son team that runs an independent pharmacy in Aspinwall in Allegheny County, and they shared how their small business really has gotten squeezed by pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs, who are essentially middlemen with lots of power in the healthcare economy. They’re vertically integrated, and they really have led to these independent small business pharmacies closing and dying across Pennsylvania and across the country.
They’ve made things worse for people who need the prescription drugs, costs are rising, as we know, and so I think it’s really important that you heard from someone like that.
These are small business owners who deliver a really critical service, especially to seniors, to get prescription drugs to folks, and how monopoly power is hurting their business, and really how it’s hurting all of us in Pennsylvania.
Capital-Star: A Fox News national poll and a Reuters poll released last week, but conducted in late April, showed that President Donald Trump’s approval rating was 11 points underwater. However, Democrats in that same Fox poll… that the Democrats’ approval rating was also double digits in the red.
So, how do you think the national Democratic Party has arrived at this point? And what do you think they can do to essentially boost those numbers, even though, again, President Donald Trump’s approval rating right now is also in the red?
Deluzio: I’ve been with colleagues of mine in the House, pushing forward what we’re calling economic populism, or economic patriotism, which to me, ties together these fights against corruption and this fight to restore the American Dream. 
I think it’s where we got to go.
It has to put the economic fight right at the heart of what my party is about.
It’s got to be unrigging the economy, taking on this corruption, and doing the things in our government to get competition and to make it so that when you’re working hard, you can actually afford your life in America. And if you’re working hard, you’re playing by the rules, you got your shot at the American dream.
I think that’s where my party has to go.
And I think the corruption problem – I talk about congressional stock trading a lot: it is not unique to either party. I think I want to see Democrats be crystal clear about fighting it and fighting the horrible influence of unlimited corporate money in our politics.
I think too many have cozied up over the years for that corporate money. It’s time to break that hold on our politics and be bold about it.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/20240124smDeluzio04-1024x612.jpg,,,2025-05-14 11:04:16.000020

(Photo: Brian Brachel/IPR)This coverage is made possible through a partnership between IPR and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
Wooden debris still blankets swaths of northern Michigan hit by this spring’s ice storm.
State Rep. Parker Fairbairn (R-Harbor Springs) represents the 107th District, which includes much of that area. Fairbairn is asking the state Department of Natural Resources to lift remaining restrictions on the collection of fuelwood — wood for personal use, like firewood. The changes would allow people to collect as much as they want from roadside areas in state forests.
“Let’s not inhibit people from being able to get firewood and get biofuel to — whether it’s heating their homes or what have you,” Fairbairn said. “Let’s just get these woods cleaned up as fast as possible so we mitigate and lessen the risk of fire in the future,” he added, referring to the amount of debris created by the storm that could dry up and serve as fuel for forest fires.

Forestry meetings this week:
● Emmet Conservation District is hosting a talk about forestry and
recovering from the ice storm on Wednesday, May 14, at 5:30 p.m. at
Pellston High School. Representatives from the local timber industry
will be there as well.
● Otsego Conservation District is holding a similar event on Thursday,
May 15, at 6 p.m. at the E-Free Church at 1649 M-32 in Gaylord.

DNR foresters have issued guidelines for how people should manage different species of trees after the storm. For example, they recommend that people prioritize clearing pine tree debris before June to help control bark beetle populations and the spread of fungal disease, but that they wait to handle oak tree debris until after mid-July to avoid spreading oak wilt, a fatal fungal disease. They also advise using firewood locally rather than transporting it long distances to avoid spreading pests and disease to new places.
The state requires permits to collect wood for personal use in certain areas of state land. Only wood that is dead, fallen and within 200 feet of a road can be taken.
In an April 28 letter, Fairbairn asked the DNR to eliminate the $20 permit fee, the 90-day limit on the permit and the cap on how much wood can be collected, though he didn’t ask for any changes to where that collection can take place.
The DNR’s website says limits on where wood can be gathered are there to protect the forests, help improve soil, provide plant and wildlife habitat and avoid conflicts with the timber industry.
“I think the permit’s still important, but I think we want to maximize the amount of people who are getting them and participating and cleaning up our woods,” Fairbairn said.
Fuelwood is measured in cords, which are stacks 4 feet wide, 4 feet tall and 8 feet long. The DNR has already doubled the amount of wood people can collect in 12 counties hit by the storm, from five cords to 10.
One Michigan State University Extension post from 2012 estimated that most homes use five or six cords per winter for heating, though there’s a lot of variation.
No one from the DNR was available for an interview, though a spokesperson said the department was reviewing Fairbairn’s request and working on a response, though they didn’t know when that would be sent.
Fairbairn co-sponsored a bill to provide $100 million in state disaster funding to the region. The House passed that bill last week.

Most entry level professionals are only remaining at Eagle Village residential program in Osceola County for 3 to 6 months, president of the facility Cathey Prudhomme told lawmakers in a meeting of the House Child Welfare System, Public Health and Food Security joint committee. While availability at facilities has shrunk in the last decade, youth entering residential facilities are exhibiting more violent and aggressive behavior towards staff. 
“For some of our children, the best gift we give them is a chance to take a break in a safe, secure, healthy environment where they can do the internal work so that they can again re-enter into a community setting,” Prudhomme said. “However, in the past 10 years, we’ve seen a real transition in residential care, and we’ve seen a real decrease in providers for many reasons.”
There have been a few cases of abuse and neglect at child caring facilities that have shone a spotlight at the need for good policies for caring for Michigan’s most vulnerable kids, Prudhomme said, noting the 2020 death of 16-year-old Cornelius Fredericks after several members of staff at the now-closed Lakeside Academy in Kalamazoo restrained the teen on the ground.
But since the state Legislature implemented new rules in 2021 against using restraints on kids at child caring facilities, Prudhomme said children are weaponizing the new policies, destroying tens of thousands of dollars of property and further endangering other residents as staff are not able to appropriately address dangerous behaviors.
Prudhomme said six other child caring facilities would have been interested in speaking at the committee Tuesday, but out of fear of retribution by the state, fear of being shut down, they did not speak up.
A request for comment was sent to the Michigan Department of Health Human Services, but was not returned.
So as it gets more difficult to serve children with high demands of need after they’ve been placed at child caring facilities ill-equipped to address their needs, Prudhomme said Eagle Village, which has been in operation for more than 50 years, is questioning why they continue to try to operate.
Back in 2020, Michigan had around 1,200 bed spaces in residential youth programs, serving children experiencing a range of issues and traumas with the goal of helping them navigate their lives successfully when they leave, Dan Gowdy, President and CEO at Wedgwood Christian Services in West Michigan told lawmakers. As of the start of this month, Gowdy said the state has 423 residential bed spaces.
And as need remains high for residential programs, Gowdy said he worries that kids are being placed at “any place” instead of the “right place” sharing that there’s a young man at his residential facility who has been undergone 40 different placements.
At Wedgewood things are becoming unsustainable, Gowdy said, with assaults perpetrated by youth residents increasing by 64% from the measured timeframe this year, compared to 2024. He said self-injuries amongst youth residents increased by 107% and hospital and police interventions both starkly increased by more than 400%.
“All of this has unintentionally destabilized children who have already been through significant trauma, and also puts extraordinary pressure on facilities’ frontline staff, significantly increasing injuries, burnout and turnover. This further diminishes the capacity to effectively serve the kids with what they need when they need it,” Gowdy said. “All of us…the department… shelters and legislators, I think our goal is to care for and support these kids and families the best we can. We must work together to develop strategies that provide the most effective and transformative services.”

“I believe that this legislation is going to give us the tools that we need to create more accountability for our utilities and maximize every single ratepayer dollar,” said Gov. Maura Healey, at a press conference announcing her new energy affordability legislation in Leominster. 
The post Healey unveils new energy affordability legislation  appeared first[...]","GOV. MAURA HEALEY unveiled a new energy affordability legislation package on Tuesday, which she said will bring down energy costs by more than $10 billion over the next decade, but consumer advocates and environmentalists criticized the plan, saying it didn’t go far enough to rein in energy companies that pass along gas infrastructure costs to consumers. The legislation – which comes in response to a winter with sky-high heating bills across the state – would take a series of steps to bring more energy onto the grid faster and empower the Department of Public Utilities to remove certain charges from energy bills. It would also allow the department to cap the amount of month-to-month bill increases, make changes to streamline the state’s energy efficiency program, and reform the competitive supply market to protect customers from third-party electric suppliers who have come under fire for predatory marketing and major price hikes.  “I believe that this legislation is going to give us the tools that we need to create more accountability for our utilities and maximize every single ratepayer dollar,” said Healey, at a press conference announcing the legislation in Leominster. “We need to make sure that [for] every single dollar that’s paid in … we’re getting the most out of that, and we have to make sure that you’re not stuck paying for corporate investments that don’t help you either.” An unusually cold winter caused heating bills to balloon this winter, and there was an outcry about energy affordability in the state. Funded entirely through surcharges on ratepayers, Mass Save, the state’s energy efficiency program, made up the biggest portion of the rate increase. The legislation follows the energy affordability agenda that Healey announced in March, which gave electric customers a $50 credit on their April bills and sought to bring ratepayers around $6 billion in savings over the next five years. Healey said that the $10 billion in savings over the next 10 years will be in addition to that. Officials also announced a $500 million reduction in the Mass Save budget over the next three years, a move which environmentalists called “short-sighted.” Healey is seeking to expand the state’s authority to procure energy and allow the state to explore adding new nuclear power technologies to the grid at a time when the Trump administration’s tariffs on Canada, a major supplier of hydroelectricity to the United States, have injected uncertainty in the marketplace. This legislation would repeal a 1982 law that mandates that any proposed nuclear facility receive approval through a statewide ballot. “We rely on energy coming in from other places,” said Healey.  “That’s why the solar arrays are important. That’s why wind off our shores is really important. It’s why we’re fighting hard to make sure that we work as Northeast states with Canada to make sure that hydro is flowing. It’s why we, in this legislation, are opening up to new forms [like] nuclear.” Caitlin Peale Sloan of the Conservation Law Foundation said that the bill did not go far enough to tackle the problem of energy affordability. She said that “bolder steps to rein in excessive utility spending on costly infrastructure projects and corporate profits” are necessary. “It doesn’t address arguably the most important cost drivers we’re facing in the energy system,” said Sloan on a LinkedIn post.  Vickash Mohanka, the head of the Massachusetts Sierra Club, said his group wanted to see more limits on expansion of the gas system and curbing of utility companies’ profit margins. “The bill stops short of doing what is needed to deliver on the promise of sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy in Massachusetts,” Mohanka said in a statement. “The current system puts utility profits over the interests of everyday people. That must change. There is no energy reform without addressing reckless overspending and exploitative profit margins.” Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director at the Acadia Center, a non-profit research and advocacy organization dedicated to combatting climate change, said that he applauds Healey for not compromising the green energy transition in the name of energy affordability. “I appreciate that there are no, what I like to call, ‘false solutions’ in there,” said Murray. “There’s no ‘Hey, let’s pursue a new gas pipeline or at least look at that,’ because we know that probably will do nothing to reduce costs.” The new legislation would reduce the value of net metering credits – credits that solar energy system owners can use to offset their energy costs. The state has one of the highest net metering rates, and this can lead to higher costs of electricity for non-solar customers. This move would affect non-residential solar facilities and save $380 million, according to the Healey administration.  Healey is also proposing to phase out a program – the Alternative Portfolio Standard Program – that provided incentives to businesses and local governments to install “alternative energy systems” that don’t have to be renewable but must contribute to the state’s clean energy goals by increasing energy efficiency. Eligible technologies include air source heat pumps, solar thermal systems, and a system to burn woody biomass like wood pellets. The ending of this program is meant to save ratepayers $870 million over 10 years. Healey’s new legislation also seeks to reduce administrative costs and streamline the program administration for Mass Save. It would allow the DPU to authorize utility companies to issue bonds to fund part of the program.  Earlier this month, the DPU ordered utility companies to spend less money from ratepayer bills on repairing natural gas infrastructure through the Gas System Enhancement Plan, or GSEP. The GSEP program allows utility companies to submit annual plans to gas pipeline infrastructure and recover the costs through ratepayers, which the DPU then approves. The program was created to encourage utility companies to fix aging or leaky gas pipes but it has led to “exorbitant costs for ratepayers” as spending for the program has increased by an average of 12 percent every year since 2015, according to the Attorney General’s office.  The DPU’s order reduces the amount of money that utilities can spend every year, institutes a more rigorous oversight process to prioritize more severe gas leaks, and creates incentives for non-pipeline alternatives like installing electric heat pumps. The agency said that this should save ratepayers money.  The post Healey unveils new energy affordability legislation  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Healey-State-of-the-Commonwealth-2025-SHNS.jpg?fit=1024%2C665&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 10:09:34.099961

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)A group representing children suing the state of West Virginia over its troubled foster care system wants the lawsuit revived after a judge tossed the case in February. 
A Better Childhood, a nonprofit legal advocacy group based in New York, is also seeking a new judge to preside over the class-action lawsuit, according to a filing on Tuesday.
“We’re asking to get the decision reversed, and we’re asking to get the judge off the case,” said Marcia Lowry, the organization’s executive director. “We continue to think this is a very serious and unconstitutional situation.”
The 2019 lawsuit brought by foster children sought to address pervasive issues in West Virginia’s overburdened child welfare system, including a shortage of Child Protective Services workers and safe homes for children. Kids were left to linger in the system for years with no plans for permanent homes or ending up in abusive group homes, the lawsuit said. 
In his dismissal of the case, U.S. District Judge Joseph R. Goodwin didn’t deny problems still persist, but said the situation couldn’t be fixed through the courts. “This court cannot take over the foster care system of West Virginia,” Goodwin wrote in an opinion dismissing the case, adding that it was an “unsatisfying result” to years of litigation. 
“I know that there are children who deeply suffer in the custody of the state,” he continued. “West Virginia’s foster care system has cycled through inaction, bureaucratic indifference, shocking neglect and temporary fixes for years. The blame squarely lies with West Virginia state government.”
Lowry said that Goodwin failed to rule on underlying issues in the system and has “firmly-held beliefs against institutional reform litigation.”
“The first thing he’s supposed to do is decide liability. This judge has made it clear that he does not think that, regardless that there are serious problems in the system, he still can get relief. In our view, that is wrong,” she said. “In the interest of justice and fairness, we think the case should go to a judge that doesn’t have such firmly-held beliefs.”
Additionally, Lowry believes the suit should continue, saying a court ruling in the case is likely to address children’s needs. The lawsuit asks the courts to mandate that the Department of Human Services place children in safe homes or facilities, receive necessary services and more. They’re also asking for an outside monitor to “conduct record reviews as necessary to ensure compliance.”
“No doubt, institutional reform of a state agency is a daunting and arduous task,” the filing reads. “Federal courts have a constitutional duty to confront that task, not to shy away from it.”
Shafer and Shafer, a West Virginia-based law firm, and Disability Rights West Virginia are also plaintiffs in the case. 
DoHS did not immediately return a request for comment. Prior to Godowin’s dismissal order, the agency sought to have the case thrown out, citing improvements to the system that included hiring more CPS workers. 
The lawsuit was previously thrown out in 2021 then revived by an appeals court in 2022. 
In 2023, U.S. District Judge Thomas E. Johnston recused himself from the case after Mountain State Spotlight, a nonprofit newsroom, pointed out ethical concerns regarding Johnston’s communication with lawmakers and the former Department of Health and Human Resources about legislation impacting foster care and possibly the lawsuit. 
Public information available through the State Auditor’s website shows that DoHS has paid more than $8 million to Brown and Peisch, a law firm in Washington, D.C. that has provided the state’s legal counsel in the case since 2020.

(Courtesy of South Dakota Housing Development Authority)The price of homes built by South Dakota inmates and sold to income-eligible residents across the state will increase again this year.
The South Dakota Housing Development Authority Board voted unanimously Tuesday in Pierre to increase the prices for Governor’s Houses, which are constructed at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield and shipped across the state to eligible buyers. 
There are two- and three-bedroom homes, as well as multi-family “DakotaPlex” options for towns with 5,000 people or fewer, and day care models. 
Homebuyers can purchase a Governor’s House if they have an income of $71,540 or less for a one- or two-person household, or $81,760 for households of three or more. Developers can buy and place the homes, as well, if they’re later sold to people who fall within the income guidelines.
Buyers are responsible for finding a lot, getting a building permit, buying appliances, laying flooring and hooking up utilities.


Prices have crept up since 2020, when a buyer could get a two-bedroom Governor’s House for $50,200. Most of this year’s increases align with the program’s income limit increase, said Mike Harsma, who heads the Governor’s House program for South Dakota Housing. The income limits were raised by just over 10%.
On July 1, the start of the 2025 fiscal year, the homes will be priced as follows:

Two bedroom: $86,000, up from $75,900, or a 13.3% increase.
Three bedroom: $96,000, up from $89,900, or a 6.8% increase.
Dakotaplex two bedroom: $97,000, up from $89,900, or a 7.9% increase.
Dakotaplex three bedroom: $106,000, up from $99,900, or a 6.1% increase.
Day care: $96,000, up from $89,900, or a 6.8% increase.

The increasing cost of materials continues to contribute to home prices, Harsma added. 
Harsma told the board that the authority is on track to sell about 120 units this fiscal year, selling 91 through the end of April – most of which were three-bedroom units. The authority typically sells less than five two-bedroom units a year, said Executive Director Chas Olson.

A “handful” of the program’s 58 building pads in Springfield can only accommodate two-bedroom homes, which is part of the reason the authority continues to build and sell homes despite their low interest. Most of the two-bedroom sales are sold as elderly housing, Olson said.
“So we want to still kind of have that option open, but we’ve certainly talked at length about the possibility of cutting that two-bedroom unit,” Olson said.
Harsma also hopes to see an improved lead time. Between 2022 and 2024, it took three years to complete and deliver an order. Harsma told board members the program lowered its lead time to 18 months this winter and “we’re hoping to lower it again as we get further into the summer.”

Chris Van Hollen, North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, Washington state Democratic Sen. Patty Murray and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski led drafting the letter in their chamber.Reps. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C.; Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas; Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.; and Ed Case, D-Hawaii, spearheaded efforts in the House. ‘Beyond reckless’FEMA announced in early April that it would unilaterally cancel all BRIC funding approved from fiscal years 2020 through 2023, calling the program “wasteful and ineffective” in a statement.“Approximately $882 million of funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will be returned to the U.S. Treasury or reapportioned by Congress in the next fiscal year,” a FEMA spokesperson wrote in the statement. “The 2021 law made $1 billion available for BRIC over five years, $133 million to date has been provided for about 450 applications. FEMA estimates more than $3.6 billion will remain in the Disaster Relief Fund to assist with disaster response and recovery for communities and survivors.”The National Association of Counties wrote in a post about the cancellation that community leaders may “need to halt work or seek new funding sources” and “delay or scale back infrastructure investments.”“Without access to BRIC’s federal match, counties may find it more difficult to pursue large-scale mitigation projects,” the NaCo post stated.Association of State Floodplain Managers Executive Director Chad Berginnis wrote that dismantling the country’s “largest pre-disaster mitigation program is beyond reckless.”“Cutting funding from projects already underway will leave states and communities scrambling, increasing disaster risk to families and businesses instead of reducing it,” Berginnis wrote. “The impact of this decision will be felt for decades to come.”",,,,2025-05-14 10:09:34.099961

John Sauer argues that those Venezuelans subject to the proclamation must be deported because the migrants “have proven to be especially dangerous to maintain in prolonged detention.""In a Wednesday response, the ACLU warned that if the Supreme Court lifts its injunction, “most of the putative class members will be removed with little chance to seek judicial review.”“And under the government’s position, courts will lack authority to remedy unlawful removals to the CECOT Salvadoran prison, where individuals could be held incommunicado for the remainder of their lives,” according to the ACLU brief.In a separate emergency filing that issued a nationwide injunction that barred the Trump administration from invoking the proclamation, the Supreme Court ruled that, for now, the Trump administration can continue to use the Alien Enemies Act.But the justices unanimously ruled that those who are subject to the wartime law must be given proper due process as enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.Several federal judges have blocked the use of the wartime law in their districts that cover Colorado, Northern and Southern Texas and Southern New York.A federal judge in Western Pennsylvania Tuesday was the first to uphold the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, but said those accused must have at least three weeks to challenge their removal.In court documents, the Trump administration has noted that adequate time for someone to challenge an Alien Enemies Act designation is roughly 12 hours.",,,,2025-05-14 10:09:34.099961

(Photo by Tony Leys/KFF Health News)SPENCER, Iowa — This town’s hospital is a holdout on behalf of people going through mental health crises. The facility’s leaders have pledged not to shutter their inpatient psychiatric unit, as dozens of other U.S. hospitals have.
Keeping that promise could soon get tougher if Congress slashes Medicaid funding. The joint federal-state health program covers an unusually large share of mental health patients, and hospital industry leaders say spending cuts could accelerate a decades-long wave of psychiatric unit closures.
At least eight other Iowa hospitals have stopped offering inpatient mental health care since 2007, forcing people in crisis to seek help in distant facilities. Spencer Hospital is one of the smallest in Iowa still offering the service.
CEO Brenda Tiefenthaler said 40% of her hospital’s psychiatric inpatients are covered by Medicaid, compared with about 12% of all inpatients. An additional 10% of the hospital’s psychiatric inpatients are uninsured. National experts say such disparities are common.
Tiefenthaler vows to keep her nonprofit hospital’s 14-bed psychiatric unit open, even though it loses $2 million per year. That’s a significant loss for an organization with an overall annual budget of about $120 million. But the people who use the psychiatric unit need medical care, “just like people who have chest pains,” Tiefenthaler said.
Medicaid covers health care for about 72 million Americans with low incomes or disabilities. Tiefenthaler predicts that if some of them are kicked off the program and left without insurance coverage, more people would delay treatment for mental health problems until their lives spin out of control.
“Then they’re going to enter through the emergency room when they’re in a crisis,” she said. “That’s not really a solution to what we have going on in our country.”
Republican congressional leaders have vowed to protect Medicaid for people who need it, but they also have called for billions of dollars in cuts to areas of the federal budget that include the program.
The U.S. already faces a deep shortage of inpatient mental health services, many of which were reduced or eliminated by private hospitals and public institutions, said Jennifer Snow, director of government relations and policy for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. At the same time, the number of people experiencing mental problems has climbed.
“I don’t even want to think about how much worse it could get,” she said.
The American Hospital Association estimates nearly 100 U.S. hospitals have shuttered their inpatient mental health services in the past decade.
Such closures are often attributed to mental health services being more likely to lose money than many other types of health care. “I’m not blaming the hospitals,” Snow said. “They need to keep their doors open.”
Medicaid generally pays hospitals lower rates for services than they receive from private insurance or from Medicare, the federal program that mostly covers people 65 or older. And Medicaid recipients are particularly likely to need mental health care. More than a third of nonelderly Medicaid enrollees have some sort of mental illness, according to a report from KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization that includes KFF Health News. Iowa has the highest rate of mental illness among nonelderly Medicaid recipients, at 51%.
As of February, just 20 of Iowa’s 116 community hospitals had inpatient psychiatric units, according to a state registry. Iowa also has four freestanding mental hospitals, including two run by the state.
Iowa, with 3.2 million residents, has a total of about 760 inpatient mental health beds that are staffed to care for patients, the state reports. The Treatment Advocacy Center, a national group seeking improved mental health care, says the “absolute minimum” of such beds would translate to about 960 for Iowa’s population, and the optimal number would be about 1,920.
Most of Iowa’s psychiatric beds are in metro areas, and it can take several days for a slot to come open. In the meantime, patients routinely wait in emergency departments.
Sheriff’s deputies often are assigned to transport patients to available facilities when treatment is court-ordered.
“It’s not uncommon for us to drive five or six hours,” said Clay County Sheriff Chris Raveling, whose northwestern Iowa county includes Spencer, a city of 11,000 people.
He said Spencer Hospital’s mental health unit often is too full to accept new patients and, like many such facilities, it declines to take patients who are violent or charged with crimes.
The result is that people are held in jail on minor charges stemming from their mental illnesses or addictions, the sheriff said. “They really shouldn’t be in jail,” he said. “Did they commit a crime? Yes. But I don’t think they did it on purpose.”
Raveling said authorities in many cases decide to hold people in jail so they don’t hurt themselves or others while awaiting treatment. He has seen the problems worsen in his 25 years in law enforcement.
Most people with mental health issues can be treated as outpatients, but many of those services also depend heavily on Medicaid and could be vulnerable to budget cuts.
Jon Ulven, a psychologist who practices in Moorhead, Minnesota, and neighboring Fargo, North Dakota, said he’s particularly worried about patients who develop psychosis, which often begins in the teenage years or early adulthood. If they’re started right away on medication and therapy, “we can have a dramatic influence on that person for the rest of their life,” he said. But if treatment is delayed, their symptoms often become harder to reverse.
Ulven, who helps oversee mental health services in his region for the multistate Sanford Health system, said he’s also concerned about people with other mental health challenges, including depression. He noted a study published in 2022 that showed suicide rates rose faster in states that declined to expand their Medicaid programs than in states that agreed to expand their programs to cover more low-income adults. If Medicaid rolls are reduced again, he said, more people would be uninsured and fewer services would be available. That could lead to more suicides.
Nationally, Medicaid covered nearly 41% of psychiatric inpatients cared for in 2024 by a sample of 680 hospitals, according to an analysis done for KFF Health News by the financial consulting company Strata. In contrast, just 13% of inpatients in those hospitals’ cancer programs and 9% of inpatients in their cardiac programs were covered by Medicaid.
If Medicaid participants have mental crises after losing their coverage, hospitals or clinics would have to treat many of them for little or no payment. “These are not wealthy people. They don’t have a lot of assets,” said Steve Wasson, Strata’s chief data and intelligence officer. Even though Medicaid pays hospitals relatively low rates, he said, “it’s better than nothing.”
Birthing units, which also have been plagued by closures, face similar challenges. In the Strata sample, 37% of those units’ patients were on Medicaid in 2024.
Spencer Hospital, which has a total of 63 inpatient beds, has maintained both its birthing unit and its psychiatric unit, and its leaders plan to keep them open. Amid a critical shortage of mental health professionals, it employs two psychiatric nurse practitioners and two psychiatrists, including one providing care via video from North Carolina.
Local resident David Jacobsen appreciates the hospital’s efforts to preserve services. His son Alex was assisted by the facility’s mental health professionals during years of struggles before he died by suicide in 2020.
David Jacobsen knows how reliant such services are on Medicaid, and he worries that more hospitals will curtail mental health offerings if national leaders cut the program. “They’re hurting the people who need help the most,” he said.
People on Medicaid aren’t the only ones affected when hospitals reduce services or close treatment units. Everyone in the community loses access to care.
Alex Jacobsen’s family saw how common the need is. “If we can learn anything from my Alex,” one of his sisters wrote in his obituary, “it’s that mental illness is real, it doesn’t discriminate, and it takes some of the best people down in its ugly swirling drain.”

(Image by Lela Seiler, courtesy of CCS Early Learning)Funding for child services in Alaska is unresolved as the Legislature nears the end of its annual session, and a committee will decide how to reconcile very different budget proposals from the House and Senate.
The House of Representatives proposed several significant increases to funding in their version of the operating budget, while the Senate’s proposed budget makes no increases, only providing union-bargained employee salary increases. Negotiations are ongoing for lawmakers to balance a budget in the face of a significant deficit caused by low oil prices.  
Programs affecting the well-being of children were among the differences that must be addressed by a conference committee composed of three members of the Senate and three from the House. 
They’re charged with picking budget amounts from either the House or Senate proposals — or a number in between the two — and bringing them back to each chamber for final approval. While there are roughly 400 budget items that this committee was set to begin to work on Tuesday afternoon, child advocates and some lawmakers are putting a spotlight on four sensitive areas: child advocacy centers, nutrition programs, infant learning and child care.
Centers that serve child victims are under threat
One of those funding items is for child advocacy centers, which provide services for children after suspected physical or sexual abuse. 
The House proposed $5.5 million for 20 child advocacy centers statewide. The Senate proposed no increase.
Advocates say that additional state funding is essential for child advocacy centers to replace federal funding cuts and grants running out in the coming fiscal year, which lasts from July 2025 to June 2026. 
“Alaska’s CACs may soon be in jeopardy due to a dramatic dropoff of federal funds in FY26,” said Mari Mukai, executive director of the Alaska Children’s Alliance, in an email on Monday. “Amounting to $5.5 million or about half of the overall statewide budget. We are asking the State to step in and fill this gap, which would allow the continuation of current service levels.”
The program is currently funded at $10.9 million from a mix of federal grants, local grants, earned income and funding, and no current state funding. 
Child advocacy centers served 2,061 families last year, Mukai noted. “Alaska consistently struggles with some of the nation’s highest rates of child abuse and domestic violence, and Child Advocacy Centers (CACs) are an essential part of the solution.”
The centers provide wraparound services for children and their caregivers after suspected physical or sexual abuse, including trauma-informed interviewing process, forensic services, streamlined investigations and victim advocacy through the life of the case, she said. 
Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, agreed that lawmakers should prioritize the program.
“That’s absolutely crucial public safety work. Talk to any police investigator who does these kinds of gut-wrenching cases, and they will tell you just how vital these are. Prosecutors will tell you the training these CACs have makes cases,” Kiehl said in an interview on Monday. 
However, the finance committee put forward the Senate’s proposed budget, with no increases for the centers.
“We took the fiscally constrained position, but ultimately that need has to get met,” Kiehl said.
Kiehl said legislators are having productive discussions, “budget negotiations are vastly better than the state’s fiscal picture.” He said the final budget numbers, which will be a compromise between the two chambers and also take into account Dunleavy’s priorities, will be difficult. 











There's so much need and so little cash.


– Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau



	“The backdrop is, we can’t replace every federal dollar. There isn’t enough money, there aren’t enough dollars. There’s just not enough money there. As we in the Senate talk with our conferees,” referring to the Senate’s negotiators in the conference committee. “A number of us have put that on the priority list.” 
“There’s so much need and so little cash,” he added. 
Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage, has advocated for funding the centers throughout the session. He said Monday he believes there is support among lawmakers to approve the funding. “Child advocacy centers are also essential to detect and arrest predators,” he said. “So not funding child advocacy centers is really not an option, because if we didn’t fund them, sex predators would go free and prey on more children. So I think for that reason, no one actually thinks the final budget will fail to fund child advocacy centers.” 
Other budget items related to child-focused programs are more uncertain.
Nutrition program increase faces difficult path
The governor and House proposed a $120,000 increase to child nutritional programs, to provide grant funding over the next three years. The Senate proposed no increase.
Rachel Lord, policy director for the Alaska Food Policy Council and also mayor of Homer, said the state support is necessary.
“1 in 6 Alaskan kids experience hunger, and 20,000 kids in Alaska are supported by SNAP assistance,” she said in an email on Tuesday. “When kids are fed, they learn and behave better. Helping to get food to kids through programs … help not only our most vulnerable Alaskans, but also can support our agricultural industry through local procurement and expanded markets.”
Lord added that Alaskans are relying on lawmakers to manage a stable financial system. “The structural deficit of the state is harmful, especially to our kids, elders, and working families. Reducing hunger in Alaska benefits our workforce, and reduces healthcare and public safety costs over time,” she said. “It is a long-term investment in our state, but it requires fiscal stability that we just don’t have right now.”
Last year, the House proposed an almost $480,000 increase to fund free school lunches, and the Senate also removed the item. 
School lunches are part of the Department of Education and Early Development budget. This year, the only budget increase the Senate’s proposed for child nutrition was $75,000 more for employee salaries. 
A bill to provide free breakfast and lunches for all Alaska students, House Bill 12, sponsored by Rep. Maxine Dibert, D-Fairbanks, also did not advance in the education committee this session. 
Advocates argue infant learning saves future costs
Infant learning programs serve children and families from infancy to age 3, who are experiencing developmental delays. They provide home-based services, interventions and therapies funded by the state and Medicaid health care reimbursements, at no cost to families. Advocates are urging an increased state budget after flat funding since 2014. 
The House proposed a $5.7 million increase in grants to early intervention and infant learning programs. The Senate proposed no increase. 
Laura Norton-Cruz is a social worker, filmmaker and advocate for early childhood programs. “In rural regions, airplane costs have gone up. Health insurance costs have gotten up. And the funding has remained flat,” she told the Beacon earlier this month. “If they continue to flat fund, it is a divestment, right, especially as federal funds disappear,” she said. “(It) is a divestment from children. And if you divest from children, things will get worse.”
Last year, the programs were funded through the Department of Health at $9.7 million. If the conference committee chooses the Senate budget, the statewide infant learning programs would be funded at the same level. 
Child care remains growing need
On child care, the House proposed a $6.1 million increase in child care subsidies, and $7.7 million more in grants to child care providers, totalling $13.8 million in increases. The Senate proposed no increase. 
Fields said it’s an issue of continuing support for the state’s struggling child care sector. 
“We have been funding child care grants for a number of years now,” he said. “It’s a question of, do we maintain continuity with supporting the child care workforce so the parents can work?”
Last year, the House proposed a similar $7.5 million increase, which was removed by the Senate, and the state funded the child care program benefits through the Office of Public Assistance at $47.7 million. 
Whether any of these increases survive in the budget depends on the conference committee, which must weigh them against other priorities.
Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, and one of the conference committee members said in a news conference on Tuesday that some of the top priorities are funds for wildfire preparedness, emergency services, and child care. On child advocacy centers, he said “we’ll be reviewing that item, that does not go unnoticed.”

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Senate Committee on Government Efficiency spent the first minutes of its Tuesday meeting explaining why it delayed release of messages to news organizations, defying Kansas Open Records Act requirements.
Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican and chairwoman of COGE, said news articles had been written about the subject, and she felt it was important for the committee to hear what occurred.
Max Kautsch, a First Amendment rights and open government attorney, said COGE failed to meet requirements laid out in the law, specifically that records should be made available as soon as possible. 
Kansas Reflector made an open records request to access submissions to the COGE portal and email address. The records were not released for more than two months after the request, although Sen. Patrick Schmidt made a KORA request for those records and received them well before that.
KORA requires records be made available within three business days or as soon as possible. 
The two-month timeline could have met KORA requirements if, as the law requires, there had been a “detailed explanation of the cause for further delay,” Kautsch said. 
Gordon Self, a legislative staff member who specializes in statutes, said the portal where people could submit suggestions for COGE indicated those “may be” public records. When KORA requests were received, there were concerns the submissions might contain protected or confidential information, such as Social Security numbers or personal health information, he said. 
To complete a submission on the COGE portal, a checkbox requires that the individual acknowledge the records are public records and subject to the law.
“Once the KORA requests were received and a response was made, there was a review of the records, all 2,000, to determine if any of the records did contain information,” Self said. “After a thorough review, there were some identified that did have some sensitive information in them.”
That information was redacted, he said. 
Kansas Reflector received a copy of the emails from an unnamed source before the KORA request was fulfilled. 
The official copy received later showed few redactions and most appeared to be names, addresses and phone numbers. 
The Reflector’s request yielded disclosures of more than 1,600 submissions that Kansans had made to the portal, Kautsch said. The names and contact information for just 55 submitters were redacted, while the names and contact information for 1,500-plus Kansans were disclosed.
“I thought it was important because there’s been a lot of articles and things out on social media – I thought it was important that this committee hear the process, the rationale for the process,” Erickson said after Self’s presentation. “At the end of the day, there are none that have been deleted, there are none that are not available for review. But as was said, we wanted to make sure that we were not including information that was not appropriate for such a situation.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gordon-Self-COGE-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-14 09:02:34.967064

The Legislature has resisted such changes.","In summary
To save more than $5 billion, the California governor wants to shut down new enrollment for adults who lack legal status and charge premiums. The Legislature has resisted such changes.



A year after granting Medi-Cal access to low-income immigrants without legal status, Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing to freeze enrollment of new recipients and charge premiums in a move expected to save the state more than $5 billion.
Under Newsom’s proposal announced today, Medi-Cal — the state’s health insurance program for low-income people and those with disabilities — beginning in 2026 would no longer accept new enrollees 19 and older who lack permanent legal status.
The 1.6 million immigrants already signed up would not lose their Medi-Cal coverage, and children could still enroll. All undocumented Californians would still be covered for emergency medical and pregnancy care — so-called “limited scope” coverage that is paid for with federal dollars. But those who don’t enroll before January 2026 would be uncovered for other medical expenses, such as prescription drugs and doctor’s visits. 
Before the changes could go into effect, the California Legislature would have to approve them in the state budget. Democratic lawmakers have so far largely balked at making major cuts to Medi-Cal coverage for immigrants.
State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and chair of the Senate budget committee, said at a luncheon last month that despite fiscal uncertainty, Senate Democrats want to ensure healthcare coverage for immigrants in California. 
“These are folks who are working, paying taxes. They should have access to health care,” Wiener said. 
Newsom also proposed that adults with “unsatisfactory immigration status” should pay a $100 monthly premium starting in 2027. Those are people whose immigration status makes them ineligible for federal Medicaid, including those with lawful status. The $100 premium is less than the average subsidized premium paid under Covered California, according to the governor’s office.
Together these moves would save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-29, Newsom’s office said, helping to address the state’s projected $16 billion deficit.
Newsom’s office said the deficit required “tough decisions” but that the governor remained committed to protecting immigrants.
“These changes are designed to preserve that commitment, protect coverage for millions of Californians, and preserve the strength of our values and health care system,” according to the governor’s fact sheet.
The decision is a bruising blow to Newsom, who ran for governor on the promise of universal health care. California was the second state after Oregon to offer full-scope health insurance to all immigrants without legal status. 
“These are folks who are working, paying taxes. They should have access to health care.”State Sen. Scott Wiener
Newsom’s office blamed wide-ranging tariffs imposed by the Trump administration for weakening the state’s expected revenues, but the Medi-Cal program was already experiencing cost problems related to growing enrollment and increasing costs of prescription drugs.
In March, the administration reported a $6.2 billion shortfall in its Medi-Cal budget, and had to appropriate additional funds to pay providers through the end of June.
The Department of Health Care Services, which oversees Medi-Cal, cited a number of reasons for exceeding its budget, including that it was spending about $2.7 billion more than anticipated on people without legal status. 
The state spends about $8.5 billion a year from the general fund to cover immigrants who are in the country without legal authorization, according to the Newsom administration’s estimates.
The request for additional dollars was criticized by Republicans in the Legislature, who say the governor and Democrats over-promised on what the state could afford. 
Newsom’s call to limit enrollment comes as Congress is proposing major spending reductions to the federal Medicaid program. (Medi-Cal is California’s name for Medicaid.)
One proposal aims to penalize states that cover unauthorized immigrants. That penalty would come in the form of reduced federal funding for the Affordable Care Act expansion population — largely able-bodied adults without children. If enacted, that penalty could cost California about $3.2 billion a year in federal funding, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Three months after first making the request, California’s largest insurer received approval Tuesday to temporarily raise its rates following the deadly Los Angeles County wildfires in January, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.
Starting June 1, State Farm can hike up its rates by an average of 17% for homeowners, 15% for renters and condos and 38% for rental dwellings. The insurer said it needed emergency interim rate increases “to help avert a dire situation” for its customers and for California’s strained insurance market.
Besides getting the final sign-off from California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, State Farm also had to get approval from an administrative law judge, Karl-Fredric Seligman.

Seligman, in his decision: “Taken as a whole, it represents a fundamentally fair, adequate, and necessary measure — effectively functioning as a rescue mission to stabilize State Farm’s financial condition while safeguarding policyholders.”

Seligman’s decision also addressed the possibility that this approval could lay the groundwork for other insurers to request emergency interim rate increases following major wildfires. 
The agreement between State Farm and the insurance department does come with a few strings: State Farm has agreed to secure further financial assistance with a $400 million loan from its parent company, and it promised to hold off on policy non-renewals through the end of the year.
Lawmakers and L.A.-area wildfire survivors are also pressuring the insurance department to investigate State Farm for its delayed handling of some claims, which they have argued is reason enough to reject or delay the rate request. But during an online meeting over the weekend with survivors, Lara said the request and the claims complaints were separate issues.
After the rate approval, some survivors criticized the move. 

Joy Chen, leader of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network: “That’s exactly the problem. Approving this rate hike without reviewing State Farm’s conduct would send a chilling message to every Californian: You can pay your premiums — but don’t count on your insurer when disaster strikes.”

Newsom wants tighter regs on pharma intermediaries

On Tuesday Gov. Gavin Newsom said he will seek tighter regulations for pharmacy benefit managers — intermediaries between prescription drug makers and insurance companies — with the aim of reducing drug prices, report CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff and Kristen Hwang.
As part of an updated state budget plan that the governor is expected to go over today, Newsom is calling for California’s Department of Managed Health Care to license pharmacy benefit managers and for those managers to report operational and financial details. Consumer advocates and health economists argue that these intermediaries drive up drug costs by adding fees and retaining discounts as profit.
In September Newsom vetoed a bill that would have regulated these middlemen in a similar way. At the time he wrote that he remained unconvinced that the bill’s licensing requirement would drive down drug prices. Newsom’s office did not explain why the governor has since changed his stance.

Career planning course creates controversy

In California more than 150,000 teenagers this year are getting a head start on their higher education by enrolling in dual enrollment courses — college-level classes high schoolers can complete to receive college credit. But one school in San Jose is one of California’s first middle schools to offer a college-level course, which has some educators concerned.
As CalMatters’ Adam Echelman explains, 13- and 14-year-old students at August Boeger Middle School can attend a college “Career Planning” course offered by the San Jose Evergreen Community College District, where they can learn about career paths, resume writing and more. 
Though there is little data on middle schoolers specifically, other research has shown that high schoolers who take college classes are more likely to attend and graduate college. But as the college district looks to offer other courses, such as sociology and ethnic studies, some are worried about the quality of classes and their complex subject matter.

Photo by Nafi Soumare/Minnesota Reformer.Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”


As hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services


But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”

Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

More than a thousand species have been identified as priorities for conservation in a sweeping update to Delaware’s Wildlife Action Plan, state officials announced this week.
The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) is leading the revision of the Delaware Wildlife Action Plan (DEWAP), a comprehensive 10-year strategy designed to guide conservation efforts through 2035.
Central to the plan is the Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) list, which highlights native species facing threats from habitat loss, declining populations, and other environmental pressures.
READ: Here are the 2025 Delaware school board election results
At-risk animal AND plant species
In a key development, DNREC and its partners have proposed the inclusion of over 300 plant species to the SGCN list, raising the total number of species in need of protection to more than 1,000.
The list is categorized into three tiers based on the urgency of conservation needs, with Tier 1 representing the highest level of concern.
Each U.S. state develops its own SGCN list using criteria such as global and local rarity, federal or state endangered status, and regional conservation priority. In Delaware’s case, the list also considers species designated as priorities in the Northeast region.
DNREC is now seeking public input on the draft list and the broader plan.
Residents can review the draft and submit comments online here or via email to DEWAP2025@delaware.gov.
Additional draft sections of the plan will be released over the summer, with public meetings planned for July and August.
The final version of the updated Wildlife Action Plan is expected to be released this fall.
The update is the result of collaboration among numerous partners, including federal, state, and local agencies, academic institutions, non-profits, and members of the public.

This San Jose school is finding out,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/05/middle-school-california/,"The San Jose Evergreen Community College District offers a course at a local middle school, and plans to offer more in the future. The college faculty union worries that the students are too young.","In summary
The San Jose Evergreen Community College District offers a course at a local middle school, and plans to offer more in the future. The college faculty union worries that the students are too young.


By 2:45 p.m. the regular school day at August Boeger Middle School had already ended, but one class is about to start. More than 20 eighth graders drop their backpacks and settle into desks — not for extra credit but for college credit.
These 13- and 14-year-old students in East San Jose are taking their first college course, an entry-level class on career planning. This middle school is one of the first in the state to offer a college-level course. In the coming years, the San Jose Evergreen Community College District wants all middle school students in this school district to be able to complete three college courses before they start high school, and soon, the district plans to offer other courses, such as sociology and ethnic studies, said Biatriz Chaidez, the chancellor for the community college district.
Middle schoolers have long been eligible to enroll in college classes in California, though only a few, high-achieving students actually do it. By offering a college class at a middle school — especially one in a high-poverty area — the community college district is looking to make that enrollment easier. The class is taught by a middle school staff member, and it’s reserved exclusively for middle school students. 
But with so few programs, there is little research about whether students are benefitting, and the local faculty union is worried middle school students might not be ready. 
Chaidez disagrees. “Navigating (college) as early as middle school is unheard of in their community,” she said. “So when they experience success, it really motivates them to continue.”
California is increasingly pushing high schools to offer community college classes directly to students during the regular school day, a set-up known as “dual enrollment.” Unlike AP classes, which include expensive exams and are limited to certain subjects and high-performing students, these community college classes cover a range of topics and are open to all students. By 2030, California Community Colleges Chancellor Sonya Chiristian wants all high school students to graduate with at least four college courses completed. 
Chaidez wants to go further. She wants every local high school student to be able to complete about 20 college courses by the time they graduate — enough to earn an associate’s degree. 
CalMatters reached out to the college district’s faculty union, which was surprised to learn the district is offering classes at a middle school. 
“This opens up some problems,” said Jessica Breheny, an English professor and the union’s vice president. “I’m sure there are 12-year-olds that are college-ready, but there are just less of them and it’s less likely. Developmentally, they have other things going on.”
Research shows that high schoolers who take college classes are more likely to attend college and graduate, but there’s little research on how middle school students fare, said John Fink, a senior researcher at Columbia University’s Community College Research Center. “Nationally, and in most states, this is very, very rare, and in many states this is not allowed.” Instead, he said the focus is typically on enrolling more 10th, 11th and 12th graders in college courses.
A college-level course, with a few middle school games
About 10% of California’s high school students took a community college class in the 2021-22 school year, according to an analysis by professors at UC Davis using the most recent data. California’s community college system doesn’t track how many middle school students take college courses. 
So far, the Mount Pleasant Elementary School District, which includes August Boeger Middle School, offers only one college course, called “Career Planning,” and it’s almost indistinguishable from any other class on its campus. The college course is taught in a regular middle school classroom, and the professor, Oscar Lamas, already works at the middle school, where he’s a counselor. Perhaps the only noticeable difference is the timing: The middle school day ends at 2:30 p.m. and Lamas’ course starts at 2:45. He’s paid separately by the community college to teach the course.

Career Planning helps students learn about career paths, practice resume-writing and learn psychological theories related to professional success. A governing board of college district professors, known as the Academic Senate, sets the objectives for each college course, but Lamas has broad discretion in teaching it. The Academic Senate responsible for setting the parameters of Lamas’ course did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
The dean of the community college’s counseling department, Victor Garza, refused an interview request from CalMatters but issued a written statement. Garza said the middle school class is akin to other dual enrollment courses, which maintain the college’s “academic rigor.” 
“Some adjustments might be needed to cater to the unique needs and experiences” of students, he added.
On a Thursday before spring break, Lamas tries to make his class more fun by breaking the students into five teams to play a Jeopardy-style quiz game on the topic of the day, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. 
Natalie Mendoza, 14, becomes the default spokesperson of her team, named the “Tacos R Us Club,” but she answers the first question wrong, putting her team back 300 points and prompting her classmates to burst into chatter and analyze their mistakes. 
As part of the class, she has to study a career, write a short essay about it and present it at a career fair. She picked intellectual property law. “A lot of people say I’m assertive,” she said. “I think that’s a really good trait for a lawyer, and I think it’d be fun to fight for people who have created stuff.”

Natalie said she’d be the first in her family to attend college but she’s already planning to go and has a few schools in mind, including UC Berkeley and San Jose State. If she does attend one of those schools, her grade in this counseling class would be part of her official college transcript.
Breheny, with the union, said she’s concerned about the quality of the classes, especially once the college district begins teaching other subjects, such as ethnic studies. 
“Faculty designed their courses for adult learners,” Breheny said. An ethnic studies class may cover topics such as sexual violence and genocide, she added — topics that may be difficult to convey to a middle schooler. “Some of the material assumes a certain knowledge about the world, about politics, which you may not have at 11, 12, 13 years old.”
High schools offer few dual enrollment classes
August Boeger Middle School sits at the base of the Diablo Range mountains, tucked between the ranch-style homes and strip malls that color East San Jose. Teachers and staff greet each other with mucho gusto instead of hello. All around the open-air campus, murals tell the story of the region’s multi-cultural heritage, especially its Mexican and Chicano roots. 
That celebration of culture is a direct response to a history of adversity, Lamas said. “East San Jose has always been a marginalized, disadvantaged environment.” As a result, schools in the community contend with education disparities, he said, such as a high dropout rate and a high teen pregnancy rate.

Offering a college class to these middle school students allows them to “see a possibility for their future that doesn’t exist within these walls here” and can inspire them to reach for a higher goal, said Marisa Peña, a school advisor.
Male students, Black and Latino students and students from rural areas are underrepresented in the community college courses offered at California’s school districts. California lawmakers have signed numerous bills in the hopes of expanding access but certain regions in the state, such as Los Angeles, enroll a higher percentage of students.
Natalie said she hopes to continue taking college courses when she starts at Mount Pleasant High School this fall, which is just around the corner from her middle school. But her options are limited.
 “Nationally, and in most states, this is very, very rare, and in many states this is not allowed.”John Fink, senior researcher at Columbia University’s Community College Research Center
Mount Pleasant High School offers just three community college courses, which serve about 10% of the school’s roughly 1,000 students, said Kyle Kleckner, the school district’s director of instructional services. All of the classes are in “multimedia” studies, he said, which teaches students how to create their own podcasts or YouTube channels, along with other digital marketing skills. 
Although Mount Pleasant High School’s dual enrollment is about on par with the state average, it trails other districts in the region. Less than 20 miles away, at high schools in the Milpitas Unified School District, roughly 25% of students enrolled in a community college class in 2021-22, according to the UC Davis analysis.
Finding professors to teach middle school
Part of the dual enrollment challenge is finding qualified college professors who are willing and able to work at a high school or middle school. Existing middle and high school teachers are allowed to teach college courses but they have to meet the qualifications, which usually include a master’s degree in the area of instruction. Most of California’s high school and middle school instructors lack a master’s degree, according to a study by the Public Policy Institute of California.

“We have graduation requirements that students have to accomplish,” Kleckner said. “The trick is finding that community college course that also fulfills those requirements and also finding a teacher who can teach it.” He said Mount Pleasant High School is committed to expanding the number of college courses but noted that it’s smaller and therefore has fewer teachers who meet the requirements to teach a college course. 
In turn, many college professors lack experience teaching children, said Breheny, who teaches at San Jose City College. “We have had some problems already with dual enrollment where faculty have gone to different (high schools) to teach and have dealt with classroom management issues that they wouldn’t have in a college course.” In one case, she said a college faculty member saw bullying in a high school classroom but didn’t feel equipped to respond. 
Lamas has a master’s degree, which is required for most school counselors. He’s gentle with the middle school students in his class, occasionally awarding points in the Jeopardy game even when the answer isn’t perfect. Lamas had two quiz games planned that day, each one covering a different topic, but the first game took up almost all of the class time. 
He ends class by taking questions about the upcoming final project. Although spring break is minutes away, the students sit still through the final minutes, except for the occasional joke and bursts of laughter. Not a single phone was in sight.
Once class ends, however, chatter ensues, the students pull out their phones, and staff escort them to the parking lot. While they may be taking a college course, they still must wait for their parents to pick them up.

A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the “full restoration” of services at the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety’s Respiratory Health Division, ending a reduction in force that robbed coal miners nationwide who rely on the program of options to prevent further illness and injury.
U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued Tuesday’s preliminary injunction as part of ongoing litigation in a class action lawsuit filed by coal miners against the federal government over the closure of the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program, a department within NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division.
Workers at the CWHSP, as well as numerous other NIOSH departments and divisions, have been on administrative leave since April due to “reorganizations” happening at the federal level. Permanent terminations for most employees were scheduled to occur in June and July as part of cost-saving measures instituted by the new federal Department of Government Efficiency.
Berger’s order on Tuesday directed the federal Department of Health and Human Services to do three things: rescind all RIFs issued to workers in the Respiratory Health Division at NIOSH, continue all work mandated by the federal Mine Safety and Health Act without “pause, stoppage or gap” if and when the federal government continues efforts to “reorganize” itself and have DHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. submit a written certification to the court in 20 days showing that the federal government is complying with its orders.
Job cuts reversed at Pittsburgh lab that certifies nation’s respirators

At a hearing for the case in Charleston last week, coal miners testified that, without staffing at the CWHSP, they are unable to exercise rights afforded to them through the federal Mine Act.
Utilizing those rights — which have existed for decades and are mandated through an act of Congress — requires action by NIOSH’s CWHSP.
But since April 1, the department has been unstaffed. Some workers were told to return to work in early May. But last week they were once again put back on leave. On Tuesday, hours before Berger’s order was filed, members of West Virginia’s congressional delegation announced that at least 100 NIOSH workers were returning to work permanently.
Without any workers, coal miners across the country have been unable to have black lung screening results certified by NIOSH. That certification is necessary for miners with black lung to qualify for a Part 90 transfer, which allows them to move to a different, less dusty part of a mine without retribution — including a cut in pay, hours or benefits — from their employers.
 Arguments in the case and Berger’s ruling

Attorneys for the miners have argued that the rights afforded to coal miners to access free black lung screenings and secure transfers once diagnosed, among other services, cannot be stopped just because the federal government is going through a reorganization. Berger agreed, saying Kennedy and DHHS “lack the authority to unilaterally cancel the CWHSP” since it exists to serve a responsibility mandated by congress.
“[DHHS and Kennedy] do not indicate how many extra months of dust inhalation, in their considered judgment, is acceptable for a miner with black lung while the program Congress established to eliminate that risk is ‘paused,’” Berger wrote.
Attorneys for the federal government argued that the lawsuit should be thrown out because it deals with employees angry over being terminated, which does not justify a federal class action suit. Berger called those claims “patently absurd,” saying the plaintiffs in the case are not employees, but are beneficiaries of programs that were stopped through “illegal agency action” at DHHS.
Coal miners could pay for savings if inspectors lose offices on DOGE list, advocates warn

The federal government also alleged that services ending at NIOSH and specifically the CWHSP were temporary and couldn’t be construed as being a final agency action. They maintained that, since those services were likely to return, there was no immediate harm present that necessitated a preliminary injunction.
In her order, however, Berger, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, again disagreed and noted that the federal government repeatedly failed to show evidence outlining how CWHSP’s services would be resumed, when that would happen or in what manner. She wrote that testimony from NIOSH employees and the case’s lead plaintiff, Harry Wiley, presented “overwhelming evidence” that the work had been stopped — not just paused.
“The [federal government’s] evidence consisted solely of press releases regarding a planned reorganization of HHS that contained no mention of the programs at issue. Thus, the only evidence before the Court is that the CWHSP and the RHD have been shut down,” Berger wrote.
That shut down, she said, presented clear harm as miners with black lung like Wiley were being continually exposed to dangerous coal dust despite congressional actions existing that are meant to shield them from such.
“As the testimony before the Court made clear, that dust exposure will cause [Wiley’s] disease to progress until it becomes debilitating. Does [Kennedy] genuinely believe that a miner diagnosed with black lung is not being injured when the program designed to confirm his condition and provide him with workplace protections to prevent its progression is rendered inaccessible?” Berger wrote. “This Court does not share such a belief.”
There is no cure and limited treatment options for black lung. The only adequate intervention for people who have the disease, experts say, is limiting exposure to dangerous coal dust that is known to exacerbate it.
Wiley lives in Kanawha County but works in a Raleigh County mine as a mine electrician.
A miner for 38 years, Wiley was diagnosed with black lung disease in November 2024 by a local clinic. He sent the results to NIOSH to start proceedings to be approved for a Part 90 transfer. In December, according to evidence submitted to the court, NIOSH sent a letter to Wiley saying a CT scan from October 2023 did not show findings of black lung.
Wiley testified that he never received this letter. He called NIOSH multiple times to follow up on his transfer request and got no response. If he had known they were looking at an outdated scan, he told the court, he would have submitted additional evidence to verify his black lung diagnosis and secure his Part 90 letter. And if the CWHSP were still functional, he said, he would have accessed a free screening through the agency.
Instead, Wiley — and every other miner in the country who has been unable to contact or work with NIOSH over recent months for a Part 90 transfer — has been forced to continue working in dustier parts of the mine.
Berger said it’s clear, given how black lung develops and the lack of treatments for it, that keeping the CWHSP functional is overwhelmingly and “strongly” in the public’s interest.
“[NIOSH epidemiologists] testified that they are seeing more miners with black lung, and more cases that progress quickly. They also testified that their work, and the work of the CWHSP as a whole, saves lives,” Berger said. “The necessary inverse of that testimony is that cancelling the CWHSP will cost lives. Remaining in a dusty job may reduce the years in which Mr. Wiley can walk and breathe unassisted, in addition to hastening his death. It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of irreparable harm.”

The National Park Service in 2022 alleged some of the branding of the newly formed Flathead Valley professional baseball team closely resembled imagery used by the federal agency.
The Range Riders, an MLB Partner League baseball team, announced their team name and logos in January 2022, drawing inspiration from the early days of the National Park Service and the forerunners of park rangers. 
Ridge Run Intangibles, Inc., which owns the team, filed trademark applications for two logos that include the team’s animal mascots, two logotypes, and a downward-facing white arrowhead with a black double “R” emblazoned on it. 
Attorneys for the Department of the Interior filed a letter of protest in October 2022, saying the arrowhead logo was similar to the emblem of the National Park Service — also a downward facing arrow, showing a tree, mountain and bison and the agency name in white lettering— and created a “possible likelihood of confusion” and “possible false association” between the two logos. 
The Range Riders denied there was any attempt to associate and benefit from the NPS’ reputation, and that the only similarity between the logos was the generic arrowhead shape — one used by other sports teams including the Kansas City Chiefs football team. 
According to documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the federal government filed a withdrawal of their opposition on April 1, “in accordance with the parties’ settlement agreement.”
Scot Gladstone, communications director for the Range Riders, declined to comment on the specifics of the settlement.
“The case was resolved with prejudice in our favor, meaning that our use of the arrowhead shape noes not imply any affiliation with the National Park Service,” Gladstone told the Daily Montanan in a text.
In a press release, team officials called it a “successful resolution,” and claimed the “prolonged administrative battle that ensued imposed substantial financial and operational burdens that are insurmountable for most small, community-driven businesses like the Range Riders.”
“This was an important fight, not only for securing our right to the arrowhead logo, but also ensuring this universal symbol remains open for others to use,” Chris Kelly, President of the Glacier Range Riders, said in the press release. “With the withdrawal of the NPS claim, we’re free to focus on what matters most – bringing families together, creating lasting memories, and celebrating the region’s rich heritage through the game of baseball.” 
Range Riders officials thanked the Flathead Valley community, fans and supporters, as well as U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Montana, who brought the issue to national attention when he questioned then-Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland about the dispute during a Congressional hearing. 
Haaland stated she had no knowledge of the dispute, which Zinke called “frivolous and predatory.”
In a statement provided to the Daily Montanan, Zinke said it was a “great day to be a Range Rider.”
“This was a bogus lawsuit against a family-owned local baseball team that, honestly, the feds had no grounds to pursue in the first place. I was happy to help them fight back against this textbook example of federal overreach and only regret that a Montana small business had to spend so much time, money and resources defending themselves against the full weight of the Biden Administration. I look forward to another great season and will be rocking my arrowhead hat proudly,” Zinke said.

(Photos by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)An incumbent who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump? Or a challenger who paints himself as the “Make Utah Great Again” candidate? 
Some 4,000 Utah Republican Party delegates will elect their next leader during their state organizing convention on Saturday at Utah Valley University in Orem. 
Their decision will have major implications for the future direction of the Utah GOP, and it’s sure to stir heated debate between two factions within the party — those who like the direction the party has already been heading under incumbent Chair Rob Axson versus anti-establishment conservatives who are fans of former state lawmaker and failed gubernatorial candidate Phil Lyman. 

Lyman is likely to get a warm reception from delegates, who handed him the party’s nomination in his bid for governor with 67.5% of the vote during last year’s nominating convention. But because Gov. Spencer Cox used the state’s other option to get his name on the ballot as a Republican by gathering signatures, Cox and Lyman both qualified for the GOP primary, which Lyman lost. He still didn’t give up, continuing his bid in the general election as an unaffiliated write-in candidate, which he also lost — however, he captured more than 13.5% of the vote, which was the most ever seen for a write-in bid.
But Axson, who has served as Utah GOP chair since 2023, got a major boost when Trump endorsed him in a post on Truth Social on Thursday, with just over a week to go before the convention. 
Axson has also been endorsed by other Utah Republican Party heavyweights including Sen. Mike Lee, who called him in a post on X “one of the most effective state party chairmen we’ve ever had in Utah, he’s one of the best in the entire country.” 
“He’s uniformly respected and admired as a member of the RNC,” Lee added. “He’s an unusually dedicated, talented, and energetic person. I’ve known and worked closely with him throughout the last 16 years, and he’s one of the most decent people I’ve ever known.”
Lyman — who is championing a “MUGA” slogan, often mirrors Trump’s style and was even pardoned by Trump back in 2020 for leading an illegal ATV protest on federal lands — shrugged off Trump’s endorsement of his opponent.

“Reminder – MAGA is about America – and I love it,” Lyman wrote in a post on X. “My support for Donald Trump is not contingent on his support for me. We have work to do. Oh, and Cox cheated.”
Lyman also continues to refuse to accept that Cox legally won the election, even though Lyman and his team have lost every single court challenge. Throughout both his campaigns for governor and Utah GOP chair, Lyman has also catered largely to a faction of Utah Republicans who continue to despise SB54, the 2014 law that set a dual path to the primary ballot through both the caucus and convention system and through signature gathering. 
After more than 10 years, SB54 has survived years of court challenges — to the point of almost bankrupting the Utah GOP. But angst over SB54 persists, and it’s one of the biggest wedges dividing Utah Republicans. 
That angst is sure to boil up again Saturday in more ways than one. 
Proposal to yank party membership from signature gatherers
According to the convention’s agenda, delegates are also slated to consider a proposed amendment to the party’s constitution that would temporarily revoke a Republican candidate’s party membership if they gain access to the ballot through signature gathering rather than through the caucus convention system. 
“Any person who seeks public office ballot access as a Republican by any mechanism other than that specifically provided within this Constitution shall be deemed to have failed to comply with the Republican Party Constitution and that person’s membership shall immediately be revoked for one year,” the proposed amendment reads. 



Let us know what you think...


 


In its bylaws, the Utah Republican Party accepts the caucus and convention process as the nominating process. Because of SB54, however, state law specifies that candidates can get their name on the ballot through the convention nomination, the signature gathering path, or both. 
State law also specifies two types of political parties: registered parties and qualified political parties. Candidates of registered parties must use signature gathering to access the ballot, while candidates of qualified parties (a designation the Utah GOP currently functions under), can either gather signatures or be nominated at convention. Utah law does not have a designation that lets parties only allow ballot access through nomination. 
If the GOP’s proposed amendment to strip a candidate’s party membership for using a legal pathway to the ballot passes, it’s possible it could lead to yet another court challenge. 
It’s also possible that party leaders could try to push the Utah Legislature to change the law. 
Axson vs. Lyman
Axson, in a statement on his campaign website, pledged he will “keep pushing back against signature gathering on all fronts.” He added that the “timing is right” because “for the first time since SB54 was signed into law, there will be no statewide offices up for election this cycle.” 
“Unlike previous attempts to reverse SB54, we must be strategic and work with the Legislature to protect the most meaningful nominating process in the country – our neighborhood delegates!” Axson said. 


Dear Delegates,
At this point, you likely know me so I will skip the introduction and jump straight to my message.
The Utah GOP is an independent political party. In their desire to influence elections and policy in Utah, our predecessors determined that a united front is more… pic.twitter.com/ka2I6oR7oA
— Just Phil Lyman (@phil_lyman) May 5, 2025


Lyman, in multiple posts on his X profile, has promised to prioritize “pursuing the possibility of the party running its own primary elections independent of the state.” He has also said the party has been “infiltrated with those who do not respect the GOP, who do not accept our platform, and who are actively trying to undermine our caucus system.”
He’s also called for a “revival” within the party.
“A revival of our caucus-convention system where delegate voices matter. A revival of transparent, honest elections so we can feel comfortable that are (sic) elected officials earned their responsibilities. A revival of a party that stands its ground and doesn’t bow to the wishes of the elites and lobbyists,” Lyman said in a post on X. 
Axson, on the other hand, has campaigned with the slogan “redder is better,” with an emphasis on “connecting and building relationships.” He has also pointed to his past experience leading the party, noting that after he was elected chair in 2023, he and his team raised nearly $3 million, a record amount for a year that saw some of the most conservative wins in an election cycle. 
“As Chair, Rob is committed to sustaining a serious statewide political organization to further the goals of conservatives in Utah,” Axson’s website says. “Gone are the days of debt and fear of bankruptcy!” 
Given both Axson and Lyman appear to be well liked among delegates, Saturday’s convention will be revealing — not just of infighting, but of what kind of leadership style resonates most with delegates and what kind of strategy to expect for future challenges of SB54.

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)A bill aimed at regulating consumable hemp products has landed on Gov. Kay Ivey’s desk, but its future is uncertain.
HB 445, sponsored by Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest, would establish regulations for consumable hemp products in Alabama, but the bill’s language and potential consequences have led the hemp industry to suggest the possibility of litigation and led to uncertainty among lawmakers, business owners, patients and lobbyists.
“It is my hope that the governor signs the bill this week. I think it’s a good piece of legislation. I think it’s a bipartisan piece of legislation, and certainly, we have to get the guardrails up on this industry,” Whitt said in a phone interview Tuesday.

Key provisions of the bill include:  

Testing and labeling requirements for all consumable hemp products.
Caps of 10 milligrams per individually wrapped product, with a cap of 40 milligrams per package.
Authorization for the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board to license retailers of these products.  
Restrictions on retail establishments selling hemp products.  
Prohibition of sales to minors.  
Prohibition of smokable hemp products and restrictions on online sales and direct delivery.  
Imposition of an excise tax on consumable hemp products.  

The bill defines “consumable hemp product” broadly as any finished product intended for human or animal consumption that contains any part of the hemp plant or its derivatives, but explicitly bans smokable hemp products and certain psychoactive cannabinoids. 
It’s unclear whether the bill would ban CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in hemp. According to the bill, “any smokeable hemp product” not limited to “plant product or raw hemp material that is marketed to consumers as hemp cigarettes, hemp cigars, hemp joints, hemp buds, hemp flowers, hemp leaves, ground hemp flowers, or any variation of these terms to include any product that contains a cannabinoid, whether psychoactive or not.”
Disagreements among lawmakers
The bill was replaced with a substitute on the floor that had not been discussed in the Senate committee hearing, and a copy was not made available to the public until after its passage. Molly Cole, a lobbyist for the Alabama Hemp and Vape Association, said she wished a senator had asked for the bill to be read on the floor.
“When Sen. Melson came onto the floor and proposed this bill for the substitute, … no one called for it to be read on the floor. And then the way he proposed it was that all this bill does is move products to 21 and up stores,” Cole said, which she felt was misleading.
Even the bill’s sponsor and the senator who handled the bill in the upper chamber appear to be at odds over its implementation.
Sen. Tim Melson, R-Florence, whose bill aimed at hemp regulation failed in committee but who handled Whitt’s legislation in the Senate, said in an interview Tuesday that he was uncertain about whether the bill bans hemp-derived THC vapes. He thought that hemp-derived vapes could still be purchased in a 21+ vape shop.
“The hemp vape products, yes, anything with the THC would go to, my understanding … they would go to vape stores. But that being said, I’d have to double check now that you got me questioning,” Melson said.
Whitt, however, was clear on the matter.
“Any smokeable, any inhalable product, is banned under this legislation. Vapes would be banned as well that had delta-8 and (delta)-9 in those,” he said.
Delta-8 THC and delta-9 THC are psychoactive compounds found in cannabis, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

‘Our future in Alabama is uncertain’
Representatives of the hemp industry strongly oppose the measure, warning of consequences for both businesses and consumers.
Carmelo Parasiliti, founder and CEO of Green Acres Organic Pharms in Florence, pointed to the potential damage the bill could have on his business. Parasiliti said that nearly every product they currently offer is federally legal and lab tested. Under HB 445, he said, it would all be illegal. 
“We’re going to keep our storefront open and serve Alabama to the best of our ability, but our future in Alabama is uncertain, and I’m really hoping Gov. Kay Ivey will veto this bill if she truly supports small businesses,” Parasiliti said in an interview Tuesday.
He also pointed to potential harm to people who benefit from hemp medically, particularly those in a cancer program he started to provide free or low-cost hemp-derived products to people referred by providers.
“Even more troubling is the bill makes it unlawful to give these products away to people in need, no matter their condition, which I think is cruelty,” Parasiliti said.
Nancy Owen Nelson, a cancer patient living in Florence who uses hemp, mostly CBD, for symptom management and a participant in the Green Acres Organic Pharm cancer program, said she was disappointed with the bill. Nelson said he plans to write a letter to Ivey encouraging her to veto it. She said she tried to leave a voicemail, but found it was full. 
“The thing about this condition is that it is not anywhere in particular, so it is a whole body sensation, and a whole body fatigue. It helps me sleep, it helps me rest, and it helps me feel calmer,” Owen Nelson said.
Whitt and Melson say that the bill’s primary objective is to protect children and regulate an industry that has operated largely unchecked. Owen Nelson said she agrees with regulating the hemp industry but feels the bill goes too far, and that she wasn’t sure if the bill would accomplish its intent of limiting access for minors, saying that children will find a way to these products.
“It’s the responsibility of the vendors to not sell children and the families to protect their children within their homes,” she said.
Whitt felt strongly that the need for “guardrails” on the hemp industry, saying it was his goal to rein in “the wild west of what’s been derived out of the 2018 Farm Bill.”
The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp and any cannabis product with no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight from the definition of marijuana under federal law.
Confusion in the industry
Molly Cole, a lobbyist for the Alabama Hemp and Vape Association, said the industry is confused about how the bill defines consumable hemp product. She also pointed to conflicting implementation dates, which say that the “act shall become effective on July 1, 2025,” but indicate that businesses have until Jan. 1, 2026, to comply.
“That’s causing a lot of chaos and confusion,” she said.
The hemp industry is urging Ivey to veto HB 445. Gina Maiola, a spokeswoman for the governor, did not respond to a request for comment. If the governor vetoes the bill, the Legislature could override her veto, but it’s also unclear whether the Legislature has the votes. The bill passed with a 60-27 vote and 14 abstentions out of the House and a 19-13 vote in the Senate. 
Parasiliti said he is hopeful for a veto.
“The governor’s office just celebrated last week small business week, and here we are,” he said. “If this bill is signed and put into law, it’s going to be putting a lot of small businesses out of business.”
Cole said that litigation is being considered, saying that “the entire industry is looking at best practices moving forward, and litigation is being contemplated.”
“We’re just trying to figure out what exactly is going to happen and what is not going to happen before we really start doing anything, but we are discussing it,” she said.
The Alabama Policy Institute, a conservative think tank, also came out against the bill, though for different reasons, claiming on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the bill would legalize recreational cannabis use “under the guise of protecting children.”
Adding to the opposition, Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin posted a statement on Facebook saying the bill undermines progress made in cannabis reform and harms small businesses.  
“Alabama House Bill 445 is a step backwards and harmful to small businesses in Birmingham,” Woodfin said. “Instead of moving us closer to justice and equity, this bill risks dragging us back to an era of cannabis criminalization, overregulation, and lost opportunity.”

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)It was not too long ago that some formerly incarcerated people didn’t always feel welcomed in the legislative process, said Jagada Chambers, co-director of the Mass Liberation Project.
During the Formerly Incarcerated People’s Day at the Legislature earlier this month organizers, including those who have been previously incarcerated, were encouraged to make their voices heard on the policies that would impact them the most.
“The mindset of the day was trying to make sure our formerly incarcerated brothers and sisters know that is their house,” Chambers said. “They can go up there and feel comfortable.”
Organizers with the Mass Liberation Project traveled to Carson City this month to back a suite of legislation that includes  a pathway for incarcerated people working as firefighters to be hired after they are released, a bill to make record sealing easier for the formerly incarcerated, and a “second look” bill that would allow review of long sentences.  
Democratic Assemblymember Jovan Jackson, a North Las Vegas Democrat who in 2024 was elected as the first formerly incarcerated person to serve in the Nevada State Legislature, is carrying two of the bills.
Assembly Bill 321 seeks to establish a pathway for formerly incarcerated people to work as firefighters with the Nevada Division of Forestry once they are released. Assembly Bill 291 makes changes to the record sealing process for people with multiple past convictions. 
Speaking during a press conference at Formerly Incarcerated People’s Day, Jackson said what is “powerful is our voice” and emphasized that the stories of the formerly incarcerated can lead to change. 
“Your voice can make this moment possible,” Jackson said during the rally. “We need proactive means to public safety and not reactive. Once we invest in proactive means, we can heal and grow. We don’t have to incarcerate and invest in prison.”
Nevada in the last several sessions has made strides on advancing reforms to the criminal legal process and within the prison system. 
One significant moment was legislation passed in 2019 by which formerly incarcerated people can vote, Chambers said. 
That law then “allowed formerly incarcerated people to engage civically” which ultimately led to “Jackson winning his seat as our state’s first formerly incarcerated,” Chambers said.
‘Break the cycle of recidivism’
As Nevada contends with a growing number of wildfires driven by the climate crisis, like many Western states it has relied on the labor of incarcerated people to fight these fires. 
“Many of these individuals have gained valuable skills working on firefighter crews in conservation camps while in custody but face barriers to continue this work after release due to the lack of transitional support and employment pathways,” Jackson said.
AB 321 would create a training program with reentry support that would “help eligible people transition into fire fighting roles with the Division of Forestry,” he said.  
The bill would require the Nevada’s Department of Corrections and the Division of Forestry  to establish a transitional housing program for those incarcerated who are “within 18 months of parole eligibility to live and participate in skills development training in forestry management and conservation.”
Jackson said the legislation would help “break the cycle of recidivism” while also strengthening Nevada’s wildlife response.
The bill passed the Assembly unanimously last month. It was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee May 6 and has until Friday to pass out of committee.
At its bill hearing this month in the Senate committee, Democratic state Sen. James Ohrenscall asked if the legislation, if passed, would open up the doors to other similar employment opportunities.
“Do you think folks who transition into firefighters for forestry might be able to move into careers with local fire departments as well?” he asked.
Paloma Guerra, a lobbyist with the Clark County Public Defender’s Office, said localities would first have to change employment eligibility requirements.
“To get your EMT certification I know there is still a barrier of having a criminal record,” Guerra said. “The reason the division of forestry is different from local firefighters is because they don’t have EMTs.”
Assembly Bill 91, deemed “second look” legislation, would create an avenue for those incarcerated to have sentences reviewed by the State Board of Parole Commissioners after they’ve served extended periods of time. 
The Nevada legislation also allows the parole board to “grant a second look review” for people convicted of Category A offenses, which include murder and sexual assault, provided the incarcerated person has served 25 years. For category B felonies, such as robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, they must have served at least 15 years.
Jennifer Noble, a lobbyist with Nevada District Attorneys Association, which opposed the bill, argued that “Lawful sentences should not be second guessed every two years each time an offender can file a new petition under this bill.”
Democratic Assemblymember Erica Roth of Reno, who presented the bill in April, said the legislation falls in line with moves legislators have made in previous years that recognize “that placing somebody in prison for extreme amounts of time does not necessarily meet the public policy goals, especially when they have been rehabilitated.”
“This is an opportunity for the board, who already makes these reviews on a daily basis, to consider a human being and who they are holistically,” she said. 
Though the bill is sponsored by the Assembly Judiciary Committee and supported by many of the reform advocates, it has not received a vote in the Assembly yet. 
The legislation has been declared exempt from deadlines. 
“We are in a battle for Assembly Bill 91, but it’s going to be a struggle because not everyone is buying in completely,” Chambers said. “There has been a great effort on behalf of the coalition to get us through the finish line.” 
Other prison reform bills lawmakers are considering this session include:
Senate Bill 88, which  seeks to discharge medical debt from those incarcerated once they leave prison. The legislation, which is exempt from deadlines, passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, but has yet to receive a vote in the Senate.
Senate Bill 323 would create a pilot program to provide free phone calls at Florence McLure Women’s Correctional Center, with an eye to extending the policy throughout the system.. The legislation, which was heard Tuesday by the Senate Finance Committee, would also prevent prisons throughout the state from charging more than the actual costs of phone and video calls.
Assembly Bill 246 requires NDOC to conduct a study on food quality, waste and nutrition within state prisons. The legislation is also exempt from deadlines and has yet to pass out of the Assembly.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC06426-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 08:07:42.408722

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)An Anchorage business owner, Republican campaigner and former talk radio host is running to be Alaska’s next governor.
Bernadette Wilson announced her campaign on Tuesday with a video broadcast from the steps of the Alaska Capitol and has filed a letter of intent with the Alaska Public Offices Commission.
She joins Republican former state Sen. Click Bishop and Republican Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, both of whom announced their campaigns last week.
In a Juneau interview, Wilson said she’s disappointed with the condition of the state and worried about what it has to offer her children.
“I see the opportunity that Alaska has here, but I also see the lack of leadership, the lack of vision. And I feel I share the frustration of Alaskans. You know, we have people who get down here and they’re more concerned about keeping a job than they are about doing a job,” she said.
Wilson, a former competitive figure skater, was born on the Kenai Peninsula and raised in Anchorage. A parent to three children, she is the great-niece of former Gov. Wally Hickel. She owns Denali Disposal, a private trash collection service in Anchorage.
Wilson has extensive experience in Alaska politics, having worked on more than a dozen political campaigns, including the effort to elect Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson and a 2010 ballot measure that would have required parents to be notified if a child is seeking an abortion. Alaskans voted for that measure, but it was later ruled unconstitutional.
She hosted a talk radio show with Democrat Ethan Berkowitz until 2015 and organized protests in 2020 to oppose Anchorage’s anti-COVID-19 precautions. 
In addition to her governor’s race, Wilson is campaigning for the ballot measure that is again attempting to repeal ranked choice voting in Alaska.
Wilson advised Nick Begich’s successful congressional campaign last year and previously worked as the Alaska director for Americans for Prosperity and for the Alaska Policy Forum, two limited-government groups that have opposed the revival of the state’s pension plan, among other issues.
She has never held elected office before, but said that isn’t an issue.
“Republicans love President Ronald Reagan. When Ronald Reagan ran for governor of California, it was the same thing. He didn’t come up through a bureaucratic system,” she said.
When asked whether she would continue Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s policies, she said she hasn’t been impressed with Dunleavy’s performance. The incumbent governor is term-limited and unable to run for reelection.
“I’ll be honest with you, I haven’t seen a whole lot of what the state has done in the last few years, not just under this administration, but under multiple administrations,” she said. “You know, name me the major infrastructure projects, name me the big things we’ve got going. We’re at the bottom of education, the same place we were years ago. We are in no better spot financially. We’re in no better spot with our education. Our PFD is spiraling, with people now trying to turn it into a welfare program. You know, I don’t think there is a whole lot there to continue.”
Wilson said she intends to actively campaign this year and listen to Alaskans’ concerns about the state.
“We are going to be out talking to Alaskans from now, clear on until — hopefully for the next several years,” she said.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis)The Environmental Protection Agency has terminated a $20 million grant that would have funded the construction of critical water and energy infrastructure on the Walker River Paiute Tribe reservation in Northern Nevada. 
Nevada’s Clean Energy Fund was notified May 1 the EPA terminated a $20 million Community Change Grant awarded to the nonprofit to advance major infrastructure projects that would help the Walker River Paiute Tribe adapt to the impacts of climate change.
The grant is one of more than 780 environmental justice grants terminated by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, according to court documents filed as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the Trump administration.
In the termination notice, the EPA said the objectives of Nevada’s Community Change Grant “are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
The funds have been frozen since March 7 when the Nevada Clean Energy Fund, which administers the funds, lost access to the EPA’s online grant management portal.
Part of the grant funding was earmarked for the construction of the Tribe’s Water Looping Project, which would have supplied drinking water to more than 100 homes and businesses that currently rely on declining well water. 
Between aging pipes, pollutants and regional drought, the Tribe’s existing water infrastructure has been stretched to its limits — compromising both public health and economic development.
If completed, the water infrastructure project would have also allowed the Tribe to build more homes and businesses on the reservation, creating economic development and job opportunities for the rural community.
The Water Looping Project has secured additional grants from the U.S. Economic Development Administration and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. But without the EPA grant, construction for the project can’t start, putting the project’s other funding sources at risk.
“They’re at a critical juncture where they need to keep moving that forward if they want to meet their construction and operational deadlines that are related to other funds that they’ve secured for that project,” said Kirsten Stasio, the CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.
Over the past four years, the Walker River Paiute Tribe has already invested nearly $2 million in planning, engineering, and permitting for the water infrastructure project. Before Trump took office, the Tribe had an ambitious plan to complete the project by May 2027.
The EPA grant would have also funded the construction of a planned Nutritional Wellness Building on the Walker River Paiute Tribe reservation, which would have served as a community resilience hub during power outages and natural disasters.
The Walker River Paiute Tribe also planned to use the remaining EPA grant funds to help Tribal members transition away from propane and wood heating by providing home energy retrofits for 150 homes on the reservation.
Nevada’s $20 million Community Change Grant was awarded under the Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement Program, a $2.8 billion financial assistance program created by the Inflation Reduction Act.
The grant was one of hundreds terminated by the agency as part of a widespread effort by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cut back on spending and dramatically reshape the federal government.
According to court documents, the EPA plans to terminate a total of 781 grants issued under President Joe Biden, including all grants awarded under the Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement Program. 
Most of the programs and grants listed for termination are focused on environmental justice and include projects to help some of the most underinvested communities adapt to the effects of climate change.
Stasio, the CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund, said she fears Nevada’s $20 million Community Change Grant has been caught up in a sweep of anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level, despite the grant’s focus on funding critical water and energy infrastructure.
The termination notice sent to the Nevada Clean Energy Fund suggests the grant was canceled after EPA Administrator Zeldin determined the grant conflicted with the agency’s “policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence” under constitutional and statutory law. 
The termination of hundreds of EPA grants also comes after the agency announced plans to fire nearly 300 employees working on diversity, equity, and inclusion and environmental justice issues last month.
Stasio said the Nevada Clean Energy Fund is now focused on convincing the federal government Nevada’s EPA Community Change Grant does align with the current federal administration’s priorities of energy independence, job growth, and critical infrastructure development for rural communities.
“We are working with EPA and urging them to reinstate this grant. The grant would support important economic development and energy resilience projects in rural communities in Northern Nevada,” said Stasio.
Democratic lawmakers have condemned the administration’s grant cancellations while lawsuits are ongoing over whether the EPA violated its legal obligations when clawing back funds through freezes and shutouts.
A day after the EPA sent out hundreds of termination letters to grant recipients, Democratic Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts — a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee — condemned the EPA’s plan to cancel nearly 800 congressionally obligated environmental justice grants, adding that Community Change Grants provide “long-overdue resources” to “underinvested frontline and fenceline communities.”
“The administration’s funding freezes have wreaked havoc on communities that are counting on federal investments to weather storms more safely, breathe cleaner air, drink cleaner water, live closer to green space, and save on utility bills,” Markey said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/walker-river-paiute-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 09:02:34.967064

BESSEMER — They all came here for peace, and so far, the land has given it to them.
For Marshall Killingsworth, the peace comes from the owls whose hoots echo across the valley as he sits in his favorite spot in his garden. For David Havron, it’s looking up at the stars at night as the moonlight glistens off the lake just outside his back door. For Mary Rosenboom, it’s the calls of the songbirds as the sun slowly sets over the hilly terrain. For Becky Morgan, it’s the view of the mountain from her recliner—through the long windows that line the sides of her home.
But all these residents in this area of rural Jefferson County are afraid—fearful that their peace may soon be disturbed.
“Town is moving closer to us,” Jeff Lowe said last week. “And we’re not happy about it.”

Killingsworth, Havron, Rosenboom, Morgan and Lowe are just a few of the residents whose homes are adjacent to a 700-acre, wooded plot of land that soon may be transformed, through years of construction, into a 4.5-million-square-foot data processing center located just within the city limits of Bessemer, Alabama, a city of about 25,000 southwest of Birmingham.
If built to planned capacity, the data center would be one of the largest in the United States and could become one of the largest single consumers of electricity in the state. Of nearly a dozen residents interviewed by Inside Climate News, none expressed support for the project as planned. Instead, all shared fear and frustration over their inability to obtain information about the $14.5 billion proposal from politicians charged with representing the public.
Efforts by Inside Climate News to speak with public officials in Bessemer about the proposal, called Project Marvel, were met with silence. The mayor, his chief of staff and the city’s attorney all signed a non-disclosure agreement with the developer, staffers said, and would not be able to answer questions about the project.

Members of the Bessemer City Council, tasked with approving or rejecting the rezoning necessary for the proposed data center, have repeatedly refused to comment.
“I thought I answered your question,” said Carla Jackson, a council member who represents the area of Bessemer where the data center is planned. “And I was so sweet about it. Right now, while it’s under litigation, I’m not going to talk about it.”

The details on data centers

In the last decade, technological evolution has quickened pace, with massive data centers now in demand for more intensive computational tasks like cryptocurrency mining and processing artificial intelligence (AI) requests. That digital demand, in turn, has made its way into the physical world as tech companies search for cheap land, electricity, water and resources necessary for the development of large data processing centers like the one being proposed in Bessemer.
A data center is like a city with computer servers as the buildings, requiring network cables, power sources and cooling infrastructure, like roads, power lines and sewer networks in a municipality. Data flows like traffic.
Similar to the police and surveillance in a city, a data center also has security infrastructure—electric fences, anti-ram barriers, infrared cameras, alarms, lights and sometimes even guard stations and other surveillance systems to protect against attacks.
As of early 2025, the United States has more than 5,000 data centers, according to industry reports, compared to around 1,000 just five years earlier. And with that increased demand comes an inevitable, increased demand for resources.

Project Marvel

The proposed data center campus in Bessemer, if realized, would consist of 18 buildings, each larger than the average Walmart Supercenter, that would house massive server farms for data storage and processing. Located on about 700 acres of wooded land currently zoned for agricultural use, the proposed physical infrastructure would require the permanent clear-cutting of at least 100 acres of forest.
The company behind the project is a newly created limited liability company, Logistics Land Investments LLC, first formed in May 2023, according to records from the Delaware Secretary of State. The company’s registered agent is not a person, according to business records, but the Corporation Trust Company, also based in Delaware—an entity that has been used by large tech companies like Google and Apple for corporate dealings in the past.

Despite its brief history, Logistics Land Investments has already found itself in at least one legal battle. Court records show that company has been sued by the First Baptist Church of Red Oak, Texas, a place of worship that was located on land the development company was interested in buying for another project. After the sale fell through, the church sued, arguing that the company had wrongly breached their agreement.
The president of Bessemer’s City Council, Donna Thigpen, was the only public official interviewed who confirmed she had not yet signed an NDA. In fact, Thigpen said, she’d been largely left in the dark on the proposed data center thus far.
“We have not met with the builders yet,” she said. “We know nothing about it.”
She referred further questions to the mayor’s office, though she noted he’d signed an NDA.
The mayor’s office did not respond to several requests for comment.
The only information about the project made public so far has been in limited answers from the company’s attorneys to residents’ concerns voiced in planning and zoning meetings held earlier this year.

Those few answers provide only small, fragmented insights into what could be one of the largest capital outlays in recent state history. But even that information is probably more than is legally required to be given to residents, according to arguments made by an attorney for Bessemer in a recent court hearing.
“There’s no provision in the code of Alabama that authorizes the asking of questions, the furnishing of environmental reports or development plans or anything of that nature,” he told a Bessemer judge. “You have a right to be heard as to whether you agree with that ordinance or not. Nothing more, nothing less.”
The city had landed in court after a group of residents filed suit, claiming that property owners weren’t given proper public notice ahead of a recent public hearing on the proposal. Because residents packed the meeting room, the city argued in court, there was no deficiency in public notice.
Monica Agee, a Jefferson County Circuit Judge in the Birmingham division, issued a temporary restraining order on April 14 preventing the Bessemer City Council from voting on the proposed rezoning of the property from agricultural to industrial. After issuing the restraining order, Agee transferred the case to the county’s Bessemer division, where the matter was scheduled for a hearing.

Agee’s temporary restraining order was “wrong and illegal,” attorney Shan Paden, representing the city, told Bessemer judge David Hobdy at an April 23 hearing.
Hobdy scolded the lawyer for his comments about the judge.
“I take issue with the fact that you’re saying that judge knew what she was doing was wrong,” Hobdy said. “That’s a circuit judge of Jefferson County, too, so I think she had appropriate authority to act at her discretion.”
Lawyers for both the residents and the city of Bessemer brought up the size of the project in making their respective arguments about how the judge should eventually rule.
“This is a $14 billion project,” Paden said. “To give you the scope of that, the entire value of all the real estate in the city of Bessmer in 2018 was $345 million dollars,” Paden said in part.
Public officials should be judging the merits of such a project, the lawyer argued, not a judge.
Lawyers for the residents living near the proposed data center site, on the other hand, argued that the size of the project demands robust public notice and close adherence to relevant law.
“This is about protecting property owners’ rights to protect their land from money-grabbing AI developers who have devastated many, many communities across the country,” the residents’ attorney, Reginald McDaniel, said.
John Parker Yates, another attorney for the residents, reminded the judge that the identity of the developer and its potential client is still not known.
“This could be a Chinese data center,” he said. “And that’s scary—that could be happening in our backyard and us not know.”
In the end, Judge Hobdy chose not to dismiss the lawsuit outright as lawyers for the city of Bessemer had asked him to do. Instead, he told both parties that he planned to hold over the case long enough for city officials to begin the public notice process and rezoning process again, in accordance with Alabama law. If and when that process is complete, the judge said, he’d consider ordering a dismissal in the case.
Hobdy set a status update hearing in the case for Aug. 1.
Despite the delay in the necessary rezoning achieved through the residents’ lawsuit, community members opposed to the project now have another, likely more difficult task ahead: to convince public officials to vote against moving the proposal forward.

Marshalling the troops

Marshall Killingsworth walked in his garden on a recent afternoon, his daylilies blooming in the warm Alabama sun. Killingsworth, 80, retired after working for decades in IT at major companies, including Blue Cross Blue Shield and Drummond Coal. Even in retirement, though, he’s busier now than ever. He spends much of his time outside, tending to an elaborate, well kept yard overlooking a wooded valley where the data center is now proposed to be built.
Soon, Ron and Becky Morgan, married nearly 28 years, came and sat with Killingsworth. Ron, an Army veteran, jumped into the conversation as soon as he arrived, talking intensely about potential noise, light pollution and the environmental impact of the necessary clear-cutting and construction. Becky placed her arm on Ron’s leg. “We just got here,” she said, laughing. “Other people want to talk too.”

‘You can’t turn it off like the AC’

In Alabama, almost all the new electric demand that the state’s largest energy company, Alabama Power, has projected is for data centers, said Daniel Tait, executive director of Energy Alabama, a nonprofit organization that advocates for clean energy in the state. Many data centers use alternative energy sources, including solar, wind, nuclear and hydrogen, to reduce carbon emissions and reduce their reliance on the electric grid, although investors in the Bessemer project have not outlined any such plans.
Lawyers representing Logistics Land Investments did not respond to requests for comment.
As demand for digital content grows, an “arms race” has escalated between tech giants to build digital warehouses and bring their services to market first. Data centers were initially smaller and demanded 50 to 200 megawatts of power to run. Driven by the development of AI, a new, second round of data centers uses five times more energy, averaging 2 to 3 gigawatts to sustain operations. They are considered “high capacity” because once the center is running, it doesn’t stop.
“You can’t turn it off like the AC,” Tait said.
If built to full capacity, the Bessemer data center campus is projected to consume around 1,200 megawatts of energy and could feasibly consume around 10.5 million megawatt hours per year. That’s more than 90 times the amount of energy used by all residences in Bessemer and more than 10 times the amount of energy used by all residences in Birmingham annually.
Increased demand for energy, or at least the potential for it, is already driving Alabama Power’s desire to double down on fossil fuel investments. The company, an effective monopoly, has asked the state’s Public Service Commission to approve its purchase of a gas-powered power plant in recent days, potentially exacerbating the state’s reliance on dirty energy that contributes to climate change.
When a technology company proposes to a municipality to build a new digital storehouse, however, sometimes “elevated demand load is overstated because every party is financially invested in overstating the need,” Tait said.
Even as the city moves forward with its plans, for example, there is no guarantee the data center will have customers once built.
Jefferson Traywick serves as Jefferson County’s first ever economic development advisor. In an interview, he said that there are multiple potential customers engaging with investors about potential end use. Traywick said he’d signed an NDA as well, so he couldn’t say who those possible customers might be.
“I really don’t even know,” he said.
Ideally, data center companies should pay for their own infrastructure, but in practice, this often doesn’t happen, Tait said. The vast majority of these infrastructure projects benefit only the data center, not the broader customer base.
Tait believes building these operations “should not be on the backs of regular people to benefit the wealthiest corporations in America.” These corporations, he said, “should pay their fair share. If anything, they should pay more than their fair share.”

Brenda Small and her daughter, Brianna, live in a small trailer park just outside the boundaries of the proposed development. Last month, they were quick to express their opposition to the project. Small said her power bills are already approaching $500 some months.
“That’s ridiculous for one month,” she said. Small worries her bills will soar even higher because of increased energy demand from the data center.
In Georgia, tech companies and consumer advocates have negotiated and agreed that the data center operators cover their own infrastructure costs rather than passing those expenses entirely to consumers. Georgia has also been more forward-thinking about clean energy, Tait said. But Mississippi’s approach to cost allocation is a “free for all.” Last year, Mississippi passed a state law that declares anything Amazon needs to build is automatically in the public interest, with no Public Service Commission review. This approach is “the most egregious example we see in terms of a cost allocation problem,” Tait said.
Alabama law contains tax carve outs for capital projects, including a specific, 30-year tax abatement meant to attract large data centers. If approved by Bessemer officials, a tax abatement under the economic development law could amount to a tax cut of more than $500 million.

Not a drop to drink?

So-called “hyperscale” data centers like those used by Google, Meta and other large tech companies can consume hundreds of gallons of water daily and millions annually. Smaller centers use less water but can still consume a significant amount of a town’s water supply if not properly managed.
To cool the heat generated by thousands of servers in one data center, a chilled water system is typical for a hyperscale data center. The central chiller cools the water, circulates it through heat-absorbing coils, and dissipates the heat into the air through a cooling tower. The water then recirculates. In smaller centers, water can be piped to nearby wastewater facilities.
Lawyers for Logistic Land Investments have said in documents that the proposed Bessemer facility’s end user may choose to rely on a so-called “closed loop” cooling system meant to reduce water usage and waste, but it’s unclear exactly how that system will work—what the water demand will be and where wastewater would be discharged.
Despite the rapid construction of new data centers driven by the demand for AI, cryptocurrency mining and cloud computing, Alabama lacks a comprehensive water plan. Under state law, if you own land next to a river or stream in Alabama, you can use the water without a permit. Businesses using more than 100,000 gallons of water daily are required to file a certificate and declare the water usage as beneficial, but the reporting is largely self-regulated without meaningful oversight, and penalties are nonexistent for non-compliance, according to Cindy Lowry, executive director of Alabama Rivers Alliance.
Most states in the east have a regulated water withdrawal system, she said. Alabama does not. “We have virtually nothing,” said Lowry.
If different sources pull from one river, like the Black Warrior River, and everyone is filling out a certificate, “There’s nobody looking to say: ‘How much can the system handle? How many straws are in the system?’” Lowry said.
By consuming large amounts of water, a data center, like the one proposed in western Jefferson County, has the potential to become the largest water consumer in the state. Already, 80 percent of water withdrawals in the state are for cooling coal, gas and nuclear plants, Lowry added.
Often, utilities may not have initially planned for such massive water demands. With their high water consumption for cooling systems, data centers pose several significant water challenges for Alabama.
A data center can strain local water utilities capacity, increase water bills for existing customers, disrupt the natural flow of rivers, reduce the water available for downstream users and potentially destroy local ecosystems.
Dynamics like these worry Ron and Becky Morgan. The couple is among the few residents in the area on well water, Becky explained, putting them at risk of becoming victims of groundwater contamination—water used to cool data centers is mixed with chemical coolants—or more general water scarcity. “We’re on the front lines when it comes to water,” she said.
Jeff Lowe, a retired firefighter, said he worries about the impact the facility will have on the ability of first responders to adequately address fires in the area.
“They say Warrior River is going to supply it,” Lowe said of the local water utility. “But I don’t know if they can. They can’t even keep the fire hydrants around here going.”
Lowe said he also wonders about the additional fire risk posed by the data center itself, potentially replete with electronic equipment and lithium batteries, in a community with limited resources to respond to large, industrial fires.
“I just don’t know if they have the resources to deal with something like that before it gets out of hand,” he said.

The loss of the land

On the whole, residents fear perpetual daylight will replace starlight and the 24-hour mechanical whir of machinery will be their surround sound, drowning out the birdsong. They foresee the banks of Little Blue Creek and other wetlands being deforested, the lakes flooded with potentially toxic runoff laced with coolants and wildlife driven from their habitat.
David Havron, president of the Rock Mountain Lakes Landowners Association, is one of the residents who filed suit against the city, resulting in the restraining order that delayed the city council’s vote to move the project forward.

He worries that the nighttime view from his dock, just a stone’s throw from his back door, will soon be ruined in favor of a project that he believes will provide little benefit to his neighborhood or those living in it.
“It’s going to look like a sunset,” he said of the light pollution. “A constant haze in the sky.”
With less vegetation to absorb rainwater because of the clear-cutting necessary to complete the project, Havron said residents are worried flooding could become worse in the area, with runoff potentially filling the lakes around which many of the residents have built their homes and lives.

Then, there’s the risk to wildlife.
“It’ll all be gone,” Havron said. “It’ll run off. There’s a set of bald eagles. There’s deer and coyotes, racoons and turkeys and everything else here. It’ll all be gone … It’s going to have to be cut.”

‘We’re going to fight’

Not long after Ron and Becky Morgan had arrived at Marshall Killingsworth’s garden gathering, Mary Rosenboom came and sat down among the daylilies, completing the circle of neighbors brought together by the fight to save their community from an unwanted development.
A sales professional, Rosenboom said she’d never delved into political or environmental issues until the data center came knocking at the community’s door. Once she began to look into the potential impacts, she quickly realized this was a fight she was willing to join and, if necessary, help lead. Now, she’s become an accidental activist.
“It was absolutely an accident, but here I am,” she said.

Sitting in front of her was a brightly colored binder, filled with research on data centers, city governance and what the impact could be in her community.
It’s a hard fight to win, Rosenboom said, when there’s so little information being provided about the specifics of the project.
The non-disclosure agreements, the residents said, was one of their top concerns.
“When you’re dealing with public funds and public ordinances, there should be no NDA,” Ron Morgan said.
Even if public officials are unwilling to talk about the possible impacts of the project, the residents around the site say they’re ready for a war. Securing the restraining order and delaying the process was a battle won, they said, but the fight is still well underway.
Becky Morgan, also a plaintiff in the suit against the city, said that previous public hearings have been largely a formality, with officials doing little to meaningfully engage with citizens’ concerns.
“It’s just a farce,” she said.
And when it came time for officials to ask questions of the developer, there was little desire on the part of public officials to push the data center representatives for more substantive information.
“They already had their marching orders,” her husband, Ron, said. “And now we have ours.”
The next stage of the fight is already underway.
The last week of April, more than 100 residents gathered inside Rock Mountain Baptist Church to hear from lawyers McDaniel and Yates about what may come next.
  Attorneys Reginald McDaniel (standing) and John Parker Yates (seated right, in white shirt)speak with residents about what comes next in their fight against a proposed data center. (Lee Hedgepeth/Inside Climate News)
The pair characterized securing a delay in the rezoning process as a win but warned residents that a protracted legal fight could drag on for years and cost the community upwards of six figures.
Outside the legal realm, the lawyers said, residents should do all they can to press local political leaders to oppose the project and provide as much information about the proposal as possible before and during newly scheduled planning and zoning commission and city council meetings in the coming weeks.
No matter what, the lawyers told the crowd, fighting a municipality with practically unlimited resources over a multi-billion dollar project will be an uphill battle.
It was a reality many of the residents were already coming to terms with. They were ready for the fight.

Pennsylvania is again ranked near the top of the list in the annual “Horrible Hundred” tally of states with the most dog breeders and brokers cited by regulators.
The nonprofit Humane World for Animals, formerly known as the Humane Society of the United States, recently published its 2025 installment of its annual Horrible Hundred report cataloging the most egregious regulatory violations as cited by state and federal inspectors of puppy mills.
For the 13th year in a row, Missouri had the highest number of dealers in the report, with 26 different operators listed. Missouri was followed by Ohio, with 16 operators; Iowa, with 12, and New York and Pennsylvania, with 11 each.
The breeders based in the commonwealth listed in the report are:
Tina Berkstresser/Mountain Hideaway Kennel, Waterfall: This past January, the owners were each reportedly charged with at least 14 misdemeanors for “failure to keep [the] kennel in sanitary and humane condition.” State inspection reports show the dog warden noted six different violations at the kennel, including issues with cleanliness, maintenance and bedding that was “soiled and dirty with an unpleasant odor. State inspectors also found more violations at the kennel in March. 
Christian and Sallie Blank/Hilltop Kennel, Gap: In May 2024, the dog warden ordered a veterinary check on five dogs at the kennel due to their visible condition during the inspection. When inspectors returned six months later, they issued a citation after finding violations for issues such as inadequate temperature control and humidity levels. In 2023, the kennel had two separate verbal and written warnings. 
Israel B. Byler/Walnut Grove Kennel, Belleville: The owner received an official warning from the USDA in April 2024 due to an issue with an injured dog. The previous month, Byler had received a Direct violation after inspectors found a miniature poodle who was not putting weight on her leg. He admitted the dog had been injured after jumping off a grooming table two days prior, but had not received any treatment. Even after the warning, the USDA found another dog in need of veterinary care in September 2024. 
Reuben Esch/Mountain View Kennels, Howard: During state inspections in September and December of 2024, Esch received two citations. At the December visit, inspectors found matted dogs, two of whom were “heavily matted.” At the September visit, inspectors found six different violations for issues such as high humidity readings, a ventilation system that was not running, and a lack of adequate veterinary care and record keeping. 
Elmer Fisher, Newport:  Fisher failed three different state inspections within six months last year. The most recent one was in August 2024, during which inspectors noted eight different violations. Fisher had three other violations in May and March 2024 combined. The August violations were related to housing, ventilation and veterinary issues. 
Sam and Ben Kauffman/Chester View Kennel, formerly Sunny Slope Kennels, Honey Brook:  The facility was previously called Sunny Slope Kennels. The operation was closed for enforcement reasons in 2010, but later reopened in 2012 and has had recurring issues since then. Most recently, the kennel was cited in late 2024 for enclosures “that were caked with dirt and grime,” and one enclosure that was not large enough; it received a verbal and written warning. Issues in prior years included another written and verbal warning for keeping dogs in such dark buildings that it was difficult to check on the health of the dogs, and dirty, unsanitary and unsafe conditions. State officials found veterinary issues almost every year between 2013 and 2023.
Elizabeth and John King/Sunrise Kennel, Narvon: State inspectors who visited Sunrise Kennel in April 2024 viewed “several dogs with abnormal conditions” and made a referral to the Pennsylvania SPCA over their concerns. They also ordered veterinary examinations on three dogs. It was at least the sixth time in five years that veterinary checks were required at Sunrise Kennel. Veterinary checks were also ordered at least once in 2022, twice in 2021, and twice in 2020. 
Naomi King/Lucky Acres Kennel, Lititz: During a January inspection, dog wardens gave King a citation after finding unsanitary conditions for the third year in a row. She had already received a verbal and written warning at their previous visit in November 2024. At both visits, wardens found accumulations of excreta, and accumulations of hair, dirt and debris. King had also been found with similar issues in summer 2023, when wardens found food and/or water that was contaminated with feces, not just once, but at two visits in a row, as well accumulations of excreta, debris and hair in the dogs’ enclosures and in other areas. 
Lavina Riehl/Springville Kennel, Kinzers: Springville Kennel has had recurring violations at its state inspections since at least 2019. In September 2024, the dog warden found “water bowls to be contaminated with dead flies,” primary enclosures with hay/shavings that were “saturated with feces and urine,” and accumulations of excreta, dirt and hair throughout the kennel. 
Lydia Stoltzfus/Oak Tree Kennel, Dry Run: Stoltzfus was issued a citation in spring 2024 after the dog warden found four violations related to issues such as a strong smell and “an accumulation of dirt, feces and urine of many primary enclosures where dogs were being housed.” However, when the dog warden returned weeks later, several issues remained, and Stoltzfus received a warning for concerns related to unsanitary conditions. The issues were not determined to be corrected until a third inspection in July 2024.
Mary and Benuel Stoltzfus/Mountain Top Kennel, Stevens: During a February inspection, Mountain Top Kennel received a state citation due to matted dogs. Iit was the fourth citation in as many years. Last December, an inspection had resulted in a citation due to an overdue veterinary examination and other issues. The kennel also had had at least two prior warnings from the state. Issues noted in 2023 included dogs who had been reportedly hidden on other properties that had not been inspected, and the warden noted that “when questioning the kennel owner about the dogs he owns he repeatedly made false statements about how many dogs he owned and their locations.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wuanita-Swedlund-dog-in-2024.jpg,,,2025-05-14 10:09:34.099961

That’s over a million people—neighbors, families, retirees—subject to the decisions of elected boards that regulate everything from landscaping to lawsuits, budgets to property rights. These associations wield real power. Yet most of us don’t treat them like the governments they are.
Why not?
Because the real problem facing Nevada HOAs isn’t just overreach, legislative disdain, mismanagement, or unaccountable boards and regulators. It’s us. It’s civic apathy.
In a nation built on foundational values—free speech, democratic governance, rule of law, and private property rights—we love to talk about liberty and accountability. Fewer and fewer of us actually serve to protect them. We often only invoke those principles when we feel personally aggrieved, and abandon them when things seem to be going our way.
Look closely and you’ll see it: people defending free speech until they hear something uncomfortable. Demanding accountability only when the other side’s in power. Defending property rights in suburban developments while staying silent when low-income homeowners are displaced or unaccounted. 
This selective loyalty erodes public trust. But the quieter, more corrosive force is disengagement.
In Nevada’s HOAs, the most local and direct form of government most people will ever encounter, the vast majority of residents have never:

Attended a board meeting,
Voted in a board election,
Read their governing documents
Or volunteered for a position of leadership.

Even among those who are deeply dissatisfied—and that number is growing—most remain silent and inactive. We want better governance but don’t show up. We want more transparency but don’t ask questions. We want more options and fairness but don’t vote.
That’s how power calcifies. That’s how small cliques dominate community decisions. And that’s how fundamental rights—like fair elections, due process, or basic property protections—start to erode.
It doesn’t happen in a dramatic, televised collapse. It happens slowly, behind closed doors, while the majority tunes out.
And that’s exactly why it matters.
We don’t need to wait for the next scandal or lawsuit to take action. Civic engagement doesn’t mean becoming a policy wonk or full-time activist. It means showing up, staying informed, and participating in the decisions that affect your neighborhood, your investment, and your rights.
You don’t need to fix your entire HOA. But you can read your governing documents. Attend a meeting. Vote. Ask questions. Support a neighbor running for the board. Or run yourself.
Because when you don’t participate, you give your power away. And when enough of us do that, democracy—even in its smallest forms—starts to slip.
Let’s stop pretending our values only apply at the national level. The real test of democracy isn’t what happens in Washington. It’s what happens on your block.
Your HOA isn’t just a management company or a board. It’s you. It’s us. And if we want it to reflect our values, we need to start acting like citizens and owners—not spectators.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-921345552-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 08:07:42.408722

The meeting followed last Thursday’s mistrial of Christopher Schurr, the white ex-Grand Rapids police officer who fatally shot Lyoya, a Black motorist, following a 2022 traffic stop.
Schurr pulled Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant, over on April 4, 2022 for having a license plate that didn’t match the car he was driving. When Lyoya couldn’t produce a driver’s license, Schurr attempted to place him under arrest, at which point Lyoya attempted to flee. A struggle ensued, which ended when the officer pulled out his handgun and fatally shot Lyoya in the back of the head. The mistrial followed nearly a week of deliberations.
A round of intense comments from more than a dozen residents wanting justice for Lyoya and changes within the police department came after the city’s budget agenda.
“In our city, the police are out of control. As of right now, the police have no accountability and unfortunately, you cannot have a militarized police force that thinks that they are allowed to use force in that way,” said Micah Colby, 21.

“Under the Trump administration, the funding and militarization of the police is dangerous,” Colby highlighted.
As the comments in support of Lyola continued, some Schurr supporters in the back of the room scoffed at the speeches, generating some tension in the meeting.
Jeff Osborne, a man wearing a Trump polo shirt with the phrase “fight” emphasized his support for the police during his public commentary.
“The cop protected us from the mob during the protests. I just want to thank the boys in blue,” said Osborne.

As the meeting progressed, community members criticized the police’s actions and the lack of justice.
“It’s always the same thing. The thin blue line is a gang. It’s all across the country. I’ve watched as they’ve celebrated behind barriers, under those thin blue line flags after they’ve killed black and brown bodies,” said Kenneth Cortez, 37.
Towards the end of the meeting, when the commissioners were giving their final comments, they were disrupted by Lyoya supporters without escalating the situation.
“It is great comfort to me to have people up here who have a heart for justice and for trying to serve this community. It is very hard to not pretend we are perfect,” said Mayor David LaGrand before being interrupted by some residents when he was referring to Schurr.

“He [Shurr] murdered somebody,” was heard from the public.
The meeting ended after LaGrand’s comments without any incident.
Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker has yet to decide whether he will seek a retrial of Schurr.

Missouri is the only state to operate separate day schools for special education, dubbed the Missouri Schools for the Severely Disabled.
The program serves K-12 students in 34 schools statewide, with anywhere from five to 60 students in a school. Some students spend the majority of their education as a MSSD student, concerning stakeholders who prefer to integrate students with disabilities into a broader student body.
The problems with the program go beyond a desire to desegregate disabled students. The schools struggle to staff classrooms, with a quarter of roles vacant.
And many school buildings are ill-equipped, with some missing gymnasiums and nurses’ offices. The schools have a collective $50 million in deferred maintenance.
“It’s important that we have to look beyond the status quo right now that we have in Missouri, and think about how we can reimagine MSSD,” said Mark Wheatley, assistant commissioner in the office of special education with Missouri’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.
For two years, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has been studying the schools alongside a group of educators, parents and representatives from nonprofits. Wheatley presented the work group’s recommendations to transform MSSD in a State Board of Education meeting Tuesday. During its meeting next month, the board will be asked to approve the plan.
“If the decision is that we just need to get better at doing what we’re doing now, we are already starting that work,” Wheatley said. “But some of these bigger levers that we have to move to make the program more beneficial for more students is going to require direction from (the board).”
The work group suggests closing 24 of the 34 MSSD buildings, six of which were recently consolidated in emergency situations stemming from poor staffing and aging buildings.
Following a decline in enrollment over the past 16 years, MSSD is using under half of the space available for students.

Consolidation would allow the department to better utilize existing buildings and renovate the aging properties. Two new buildings would be built, bringing the program to 12 schools by the end of 2036.
The cost of the construction is estimated at nearly $183 million, which lawmakers would have to fund.
The state would also have to invest in special education in public school districts. The work group hopes to create collaboratives of districts in rural areas to serve students closer to home.
“We don’t want to create a situation where kids are sent back to their local school district and the local school district is not equipped to handle them,” said Jacob Klett, an education advisor with Public Consulting Group.
Board members were largely impressed with the presentation Tuesday, calling the work “extraordinary.”
But Brooks Miller, a new board member from Sunrise Beach, questioned the longevity of the plan.
“Are we trying to design something now that’s going to take us three or four years, and then in five or six years, it’s not nearly the problem that we had when we designed it?” he asked.
Wheatley said he plans for continuous assessments and hopes to keep an active workgroup to continually study special education in Missouri.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051325_eslinger1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-14 08:07:42.408722

A decision to keep the birthing center open would show a dedication to the belief that the center is core to the mission of Copley.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  John Puleio: Birthing an opportunity at Copley Hospital.","This commentary is by John Puleio of Middlesex. He is a retired educator living in Middlesex, and is married with three grown children raised in Vermont.Lamoille County’s Morrisville-based Copley Hospital has developed one of the most successful orthopedic centers in the state of Vermont. This high-quality and sought after service has become a gem of this small critical-access hospital.A newly opened beautiful facility on the nearby Waterbury campus is proof positive that when a service is valued for its success and contribution to health for an increasing number of patients, the service can grow and become an economic engine for the overall benefit of the hospital. Appreciable salaries and generous bonuses demonstrate this success and allow for the sustainability of top-notch practitioners.Not all services within an institution such as Copley can be large income generators in the manner of the highly specialized offerings of orthopedics. Think of care for infants within early child care centers. Because of high staffing costs, this service is a well-known net income loser. Costs and revenue come into balance because care of preschoolers — in the same setting — is less costly. Not such a naive apples-to-oranges comparison considering that one keeps the other viable while the school as a whole is sustained.The critical and vital services provided by Copley Hospital’s birthing center could be the beneficiary of the success of orthopedics while adding to the continued viability of the hospital.It’s quite well known that birthing centers, particularly small rural ones, are not money makers. Never have been. That’s hardly the reason why hospitals have maintained such essential services birthing centers have always provided.Health care is a birth-to-end-of-life proposition. Birthing centers serve as gateways to future care and relationships for people that hospitals have an obligation to serve. If we look at profitability as the sole rationale to possibly close Copley’s birthing center, we miss the opportunity to grow the value, prominence and attractiveness of the birthing center. Like Orthopedics, it could be a brighter gem in its crown.Profitability is not the only factor that makes a center shine, and there is certainly room for growth. According to UVM’s Vermont State Data Center, Lamoille is one of the counties in Vermont that shows population growth. And from the Vermont Department of Health’s vital statistics report, Lamoille County had the second-highest birth rate per 1,000 residents in 2022. As has been widely publicized, the March of Dimes 2024 report scored Vermont as the only state with an A grade in maternal and newborn health outcomes.Surely Copley’s midwifery model — one of three in the state — contributes to this high grade. Midwifery care can be one of the safest, most cost effective means of managing pregnancy and birth. A 2023 Yale School of Medicine paper concluded “that many measures of successful pregnancy are elevated when midwives play a central role.” Certainly this care has led Copley to have one of the lowest cesarean section rates in the state. In truth, efforts to simply maintain the birthing center are not enough. Additional efforts to engage consultants to review all management practices and not just at the Birthing Center may yield efficiencies and savings.Moreso, a vision that puts full force into promoting the birthing center’s exceptional track record, improving the facility to make a beautiful space, honoring nurses as essential links to the vitality of our families, innovating to expand wrap-around services and fully marketing the birthing center can only lead to expanded use and prominence as a leading center of care.As a gateway and as an exceptional midwifery model, the success of the birthing center could well contribute to the overall value and sustainability of Copley, thus proving itself to be an essential community-affirming crown of multiple jewels, and a model for Vermont.A decision to keep the birthing center open would show a dedication to the belief that the center is core to the mission of Copley. A decision to keep it alive would highlight its exceptional care and its vital role and importance to the local community’s health and economy.This decision to save the birthing center would not be possible without a willingness to show a supreme commitment to the care for women, newborns and families, despite the monetary limitations. All of the above are excellent reasons to urge Copley’s board of directors to stand up for sustaining and growing the birthing center.Read the story on VTDigger here:  John Puleio: Birthing an opportunity at Copley Hospital.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-14 07:04:47.478702

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)When Washington Lt. Gov. Denny Heck arrived in British Columbia last week, he wondered how he’d be received.
After all, the past few months have seen the usually strong relationship between Canada and the United States upended. Since January, President Donald Trump has played tariff politics with the allies north of the border and repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Canada as the “51st state.”
Heck and the Washington delegation brought a simple message: “We love Canada.”
Canadian legislators from both parties welcomed the envoy in Victoria and emphasized that they remain in step with Washington state.
“We’ve always had this strong relationship between Washington and B.C. and that continues despite the challenges that we’re facing from the White House,” said Rick Glumac, the province’s trade minister. “This is one man that’s causing a lot of turmoil, not just in Canada but across the world in terms of how these tariffs are being handled.”
To Heck, the reception was “incredibly gratifying.”
“Looked at another way, maybe this is just an opportunity to double down on our friendship,” Heck said in an interview.
Heck traveled with Democratic state Sens. Lisa Wellman, of Mercer Island, and Sharon Shewmake, of Bellingham, along with a couple of his advisers.
Their visit to the B.C. Legislature last Tuesday came the same day Trump met with the new Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, in the Oval Office. In the meeting, Carney made clear to Trump the United States would never annex Canada.
With their Canadian counterparts, Washington officials discussed the now-paused negotiations on updating the Columbia River Treaty governing the transboundary waterway and housing issues. Heck, a lead adviser on housing during Gov. Bob Ferguson’s transition into office, said he was particularly interested in B.C.’s regulations to tax outside speculators who snatch up homes and leave them vacant and limit short-term rentals.
The two sides also came to an informal agreement on how to organize an interparliamentary exchange to make such meetings an annual occurrence. Washington lawmakers last year approved opening such a dialogue between the two Legislatures. 
Heck expects to soon formalize that agreement. The goal is to “learn from one another, but the truth is, it has this kind of overarching purpose, I hope, to maintain good, strong communications, so that the deep, deep friendship we have can continue.”
Shewmake cited next year’s FIFA World Cup, the development of a new regional hub focused on hydrogen power and the fentanyl epidemic as topics she hopes to collaborate on. She also mentioned recycling policy as Washington embarks on a new program that puts more of the onus on packaging producers to ensure their products are recyclable — a goal for which Canada is ahead of the curve.
In the meantime, Blaine, in Shewmake’s borderland district, is dealing with declining sales tax revenue with fewer Canadians crossing the border, the senator said. 
Glumac pointed to the potential for a high-speed rail corridor connecting Portland and Vancouver, B.C., an idea that has yet to gain serious momentum.
And issues like wildfire know no borders.
Another piece Washington lawmakers could learn from is the unique question-and-answer period the B.C. Legislature reserves for members of the minority party to grill the ruling party, separate from floor debate on a specific policy.
“It’s a part of the opposition holding the government accountable and transparent, but it did not seem to be personal at all when all was said and done,” Heck said. He described it as a “different way to practice democracy.”
Heck, chair of the Legislative Committee on Economic Development and International Relations, led a trade mission to Canada last June, with stops in Vancouver and Ottawa.
The trip helped deliver an agreement between British Columbia and Washington for local wine grape growers to ship massive amounts of their grapes north of the border after a freeze devastated the Canadian harvest.
Members of the B.C. Legislature visited Washington for meetings in January.
Washington is a vital trade partner for B.C., with nearly one-third of the province’s exports to the United States going to the Evergreen State, according to the Business Council of British Columbia.
In 2023, Washington imported over $7 billion worth of goods, like oil and gas, from the province. That oil is often imported to refineries in northwest Washington for refining and then traded back to Canada.
Washington exported over $5 billion to B.C. Top exports include electric power, refined petroleum and seafood products.
“Our two regions share one of the most vibrant cross-border trade relationships in North America, and strengthening those economic ties is a priority we both deeply value,” said Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia Raj Chouhan in a statement.
“Lieutenant Governor Heck emphasized that British Columbia is a key partner for Washington, and that the State stands shoulder-to-shoulder with our Province during these challenging times in the Canada–U.S. relationship,” Chouhan continued. “I trust that Lieutenant Governor Heck left Victoria with no doubt that this sentiment is fully and firmly reciprocated.”
Gov. Bob Ferguson also met late last month with Craig Weichel, the consul general of Canada in Seattle. After the meeting, Ferguson wrote on social media that “both of us recognize, as neighbors and allies, cooperation and constructive dialogue has made for prosperity and safety on both sides of our shared border.”
Ferguson also recently met with the head consul of Mexico in Seattle to similarly emphasize the state’s relationship with the country.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2138-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 07:04:47.478702

How much effort should we put towards a circular economy when deeper change is needed?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  PhD fellows: UVM’s Casella Center is a wasted opportunity to explore our compulsory consumption.","This commentary is by a group of PhD fellows with the Leadership for the Ecozoic organization: Hannah Gokaslan, Tom James, Em O’Hara, Matías Vaccarezza Sevilla and Dakota Walker.This spring, the University of Vermont announced the new Casella Center for Circular Economy and Sustainability, sponsored by a $1.5 million donation from Casella Waste Systems. The center promises research that facilitates a transition to “a more circular economy where materials are recycled to create further value.”As part of a group of graduate students studying ecological economics, the announcement raised some questions, primarily: What does it mean for Casella, the billion-dollar company that privately operates Vermont’s only landfill, to sponsor a center for a circular economy? It’s easy to think that we know for certain what waste is, and what it isn’t. We may consider it to be the leftovers or the undesirable parts of something. We throw it away, maybe sorting it into different bins before, and for many of us in Vermont, these bins are picked up and emptied miles away from our homes.But what we consider waste is a relatively malleable thing (remember the adage, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure?), and many forms of waste are hard, if not impossible, to manage, despite the waste management industry’s best efforts to quantify and contain them.Take PFAS, a family of “forever chemicals” (often found in high levels in leachate) that travel through waterways, blood streams, and root systems with serious and wide-ranging health impacts. Casella’s Coventry landfill generates about 12 million gallons of leachate every year, with thousands more tons of sludge imported from out of state which can also contain PFAS.The 2024 spill in the landfill, not to mention the discovery of PFAS contamination in nearby Lake Memphremagog prior to the spill, is a reminder that even technological advancements and environmental regulations often fail to truly contain these more amorphous forms of waste. The circular economy has gained traction in sustainability discourses over the past 30 years. Although it emphasizes reducing waste and pollution, the circular economy often misses the core problem with waste.The circular economy is considered a way to close the loop of resource use in society, envisioning an infinite recirculation of materials into production processes. The Casella sponsorship center at UVM is a reminder of the shortcomings of a circular economy, which is ultimately underpinned by a growth-oriented economy based on overconsumption.In a circular economy, waste acquires economic value rather than simply being seen as valueless outputs in a linear economy. Waste is subjected to the logic of supply and demand, and waste management becomes a global, profit-oriented industry that benefits from increasing waste production (contributing to countries’ GDP).By this logic, recycled/upcycled materials must be cheaper than raw materials to meet market demands. What type of circularity emerges when only the cheapest forms of waste can be recirculated? Are we moving towards a circular economy when we allow waste management companies to sell contaminated sewage sludge to farmers to spread on their fields?Lowering the cost of recycled materials requires economies of scale. In other words, consolidating waste management companies into monopolies, as Casella has arguably become. Making waste cheap enough to recirculate also means placing landfills where land is cheaper – often alongside already marginalized communities.Circular economy approaches frequently ignore waste produced before household consumption. A huge percentage of the resources that are extracted are already wasted or mismanaged at the beginning of the supply chain to produce our goods and services.Recycling is a resource-intensive process that still produces toxic byproducts that cannot be recirculated as “valuable” inputs. Critics see the circular economy as a new form of greenwashing, presenting solutions to environmental problems without fully addressing their root causes. Instead of focusing on technological and market-oriented solutions that only seem to make the problem worse, we advocate for a degrowth approach to waste management. What if we focus our energies on the very root of the problem: decreasing consumption? What if we focus our efforts on holding accountable companies that produce and design waste at the very beginning of the supply chain?A degrowth vision focuses on substantially reducing the creation and disposal of waste and reusing what is already circulating. It calls for a collective socioecological valorization of waste, which we do through community initiatives such as communal repair shops, voluntary exchanges, neighborhood-based organization composting and educational forums to design prevention strategies collectively.We don’t doubt that the new center at UVM will contribute to innovative research to create more sustainable waste management systems, an important step in the interim. But, how much effort should we put towards a circular economy when deeper change is needed? Understanding the variable nature of waste and the technological solutions’ limitations in handling our global waste is a crucial part of shaping a better future. This summer, the Leadership for the Ecozoic research group will be hosting coffee hours on Church Street to talk about degrowth in an informal, community-oriented space.

As a small business owner in Minnesota’s boating industry, I’m proud to help families get out on the water—whether it’s for fishing, watersports, or just enjoying our beautiful lakes. But a well-intended state law creates big problems for folks like me — and possibly compromise our ability to do business at all.
A key part of our livelihood — literally, the keys and key fobs used to start boats — is on the chopping block thanks to a law passed in 2023, which restricts lead and cadmium levels in consumer products. While the goal of reducing toxic materials is important, this law fails to recognize the realities of how marine equipment is built and used.
Unless the Legislature acts to remove keys from this law, it effectively bans the use of traditional marine keys and key fobs in Minnesota. That might not sound like much, but for those of us in the industry, it’s a game-changer — and not in a good way.
The marine industry relies on durable, corrosion-resistant components that can withstand harsh conditions. The small amount of lead in these keys plays an essential role in ensuring they last, fit properly, and don’t damage ignition systems or key-cutting machines. Finding a replacement isn’t as simple as swapping materials. It’s an expensive, time-consuming process that requires retooling and testing, often taking years to do safely and effectively.
And it’s not just manufacturers that are impacted — family-owned boat dealerships like mine are at risk. If manufacturers can’t legally ship us compliant keys, we can’t sell boats. Period. No keys means no ignition. No ignition means no sales. We’re not talking about a minor inconvenience — we’re talking about an effective ban on boating in Minnesota.
If not addressed, this could bring the entire industry to a halt in our state. That includes not just dealers like me, but engine suppliers, marinas, service centers, and every worker connected to recreational boating. And let’s not forget the tens of thousands of Minnesota families who rely on access to boats and watersports each summer.
The good news is there’s a fix. Legislators have proposed a commonsense exemption for keys. It doesn’t water down the broader goal of reducing toxic materials — it just acknowledges the unique needs of our industry.
Minnesota’s boating industry supports local jobs, brings families together, and fuels our summer tourism economy. We’re asking lawmakers to support these provisions so we can keep doing what we do best: getting people on the water, safely and responsibly.
Without this change, the future of boating in Minnesota — and businesses like mine — are at risk.

Bob Ferguson signed a trio of bills on Monday related to protecting immigrants in Washington state. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Gov. Bob Ferguson signed three bills to protect immigrant rights this week. 
These included measures to strengthen state power to inspect private detention facilities, prevent coercion in the workplace, and prohibit bail bond agents from enforcing immigration laws. 
Lawmakers put forward the legislation at a time when President Donald Trump is trying to crack down on people crossing into the country illegally and as his administration presses to deport immigrants already in the U.S. without legal authorization. 
Here’s a look at what the new state laws would do. 
Detention centers 
State lawmakers have been pushing for greater transparency at the for-profit immigrant detention center in Tacoma. Previous efforts on this front have landed the state in court battles with the for-profit company that operates the facility, The GEO Group.
House Bill 1232 is the latest attempt to pave the way for the state’s Department of Health to inspect the Northwest ICE Processing Center and enforce compliance with state and federal laws there. 
It establishes additional standards for such facilities in areas like sanitation, ventilation and medical care, along with new safeguards against abuse. 
The bill also expands the definition of private detention facilities to include those run by nonprofit organizations after The GEO Group, which runs the Tacoma facility, claimed to be singled out under existing law. The nonprofit Martin Hall Juvenile Detention Facility, near Spokane, will now join the list of these facilities. 
Rep. Lillian Ortiz-Self, D-Mukilteo, sponsor of the bill, said she hopes this legislation demonstrates the state is not targeting a single facility. 
The law is effective immediately. 
Workplace coercion
There is often limited recourse for immigrant workers facing threats or being exploited by their employer. Senate Bill 5104, sponsored by Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Seattle, intends to give immigrant workers better tools when facing coercion in the workplace.

The bill would require the state’s Department of Labor and Industries to investigate complaints of coercion and would allow the agency to impose civil penalties when violations occur.
Coercion differs from retaliation because it happens before an employee raises an issue. Retaliation happens after the employee does so. 
During the complaint process, when a worker files a complaint, the department will notify the employer, but language in the bill was added to make a worker’s personal information confidential to anyone other than the department and the employee. 
“Every Washington worker can and should feel safe to report workplace injustices without fear of coercion or retaliation of any kind,” Ferguson said at the bill signing.
The bill would take effect on July 1. 
Bail bond agents
Following an incident in January during a public meeting in Sunnyside, a person claiming to be a “bounty hunter” said that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would soon use bail bond agents to arrest people in the U.S. without legal authorization and pay them $1,000 for every arrest. ICE had detained two people in Sunnyside around this time.
Senate Bill 5714 would expand the list of unprofessional conduct for bail bond agents to include enforcement of a civil immigration warrant. The Department of Licensing could take disciplinary action against agents found to be in violation.
Bail bond agents already largely lacked the authority to get involved in immigration issues. But Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma, said she introduced the bill because “people can operate right on the boundaries.” The law, she said, will provide clarification about those boundaries and the penalties for crossing them. 
It would also prevent agents from sharing a defendant’s immigration status with anyone outside their business. 
The bill would take effect on July 27. 
Other legislation
In addition to the laws the governor signed Monday, the Legislature approved a bill to allow immigrants to use paid sick time for immigration proceedings, which Ferguson signed in April, and a bill to have an expedited pardon process for those facing deportation, which is awaiting the governor’s signature. 
Lawmakers also maintained funding in the budget they approved for a state program that provides health care coverage that mirrors Medicaid to a limited number of immigrants without legal status.

Ron DeSantis said last week that he will soon sign legislation that, among its provisions, would ban trafficking in psychedelic mushroom spores.

Ron DeSantis said last week that he will soon sign legislation that, among its provisions, would ban trafficking in psychedelic mushroom spores.
That measure is part of an omnibus “Florida Farm Bill” (SB 700) sponsored by Central Florida Republican Keith Truenow that is best known for including a ban on certain additives like fluoride in the drinking water supply.
Psilocybin mushrooms are illegal in the United States for possession and sale, because psilocybin is considered a controlled substance. Psilocybin spores, the small reproduction units that get dispersed by fungi, are legal, however, because they don’t contain psilocybin, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
As the bill’s House analysis says, “Certain mushroom spores and mycelium, which is a type of fungi, can be propagated and grown into mushrooms that have psilocybin properties. But the spores do not contain any psilocybin properties themselves and therefore could be considered legal under current law.”
A violation of the new ban would be a first-degree misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of $1,000.
Disappointing
The decision is disappointing to those who believe the use of psychedelic mushrooms can help people experiencing treatment-resistant depression. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 bestowed a “breakthrough-therapy” designation to a British life sciences company for its psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression. The FDA designates a drug as such if preliminary clinical evidence shows it may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy.
Small clinical trials have shown that individual doses of psilocybin, given in a therapeutic setting, can make major changes in people suffering from treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, CNN reported in 2022.
That’s what led former Miami Beach Democrat Mike Grieco to introduce legislation back when he served in the Florida House of Representatives a few years ago to direct the Florida Department of Health and the Board of Medicine to study the therapeutic efficacy of alternative therapies like psilocybin. That legislation didn’t advance.
“Despite my legislation from a few years ago not gaining traction, we have seen throughout the country and internationally expanded acceptance of psilocybin and other psychedelics in the mental health and the therapeutic space,” Grieco told the Phoenix.
“It’s a shame that Florida has not taken advantage of the psilocybin redesignation by the FDA that allows for research and clinical studies. I would love to see our state make these therapies available to our veterans and first responder organizations.”
Grieco’s bill called for the Department of Health, in collaboration with the Board of Medicine, to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of alternative therapies, including the use of MDMA (a/k/a ecstasy), psilocybin, and ketamine in treating mental and other medical conditions, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, chronic pain, and migraines.
A significant setback for the movement to bring psychedelics into the mainstream of mental health care took place last summer after the FDA opted not to approve MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. Instead, the agency asked Lykos Therapeutics to further study the safety and efficacy of the treatment, according to CNN.
As the House bill analysis says, “psilocybin, also known as ‘magic mushrooms,’ are naturally occurring and consumed for their hallucinogenic effects.”
Under Florida law, psilocybin and psilocyn are classified as Schedule I substances. Possession of psilocybin in Florida is a third-degree felony.
 Poor move?
Those who work in the psychedelic space think it’s a poor move by the Legislature.
“Florida is trying to outlaw the literal roots of the psychedelic renaissance — the mycelium that connects hope, healing, and nature itself,” said Peter Sessa, a lead organizer for Cannadelic Miami, a cannabis and psychadelics expo that will take place later this month at the Miami Airport Convention Center. “This bill doesn’t just ban mushroom spores – it bans connection, curiosity, and the future of mental health.”
Carlos Hermida owns Chillum Mushrooms and Hemp Dispensary, which has locations in Tampa and St. Petersburg.
“I don’t think lawmakers should be making the potentiality of something illegal,” he contends. “Are we going to start making it illegal because we think someone could grow up to rob a liquor store or something like that?”
Hermida adds that Mycelium is a fungus that grows in the ground. “This particular fungus grows in manure. Is manure now illegal in Florida? Is rotting manure now illegal. Is that what’s going on?”
There was no public debate on the provision during discussion of the farm bill in the Legislature. It consists of just eight lines in the 111-page bill.
In recent years, Oregon and Colorado passed legislation decriminalizing psilocybin and legalizing its supervised use. Cities like Berkeley, Seattle, and Detroit have also decriminalized the psychedelic mushrooms.
Calls to U.S. poison centers involving psilocybin among adolescents and young adults rose sharply after several U.S. cities and states began decriminalizing the substance, University of Virginia School of Medicine researchers found in a 2024 study.
Ellen Snelling of the Hillsborough County Anti-Drug Alliance said that she wasn’t that familiar with the measure banning psilocybin spores, but had a bigger concern about alternatives to psilocybin.
“A variety of psychedelic mushroom products are sold in smoke shops in Florida. An emergency room doctor told me he’s seeing more people coming in after using mushrooms,” she said.
Once the measure is signed by DeSantis, Florida will join states like Georgia and Idaho in tightening regulations on psychedelic mushroom spores.

(From the IEDC's LEAP webpage)After buying thousands of acres in Boone County to home a contentious technology park, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. (IEDC) quietly listed two purchases for sale one month ago. Prices for both are less than what state taxpayers paid two years ago for the properties. 
The Limitless Exploration/Advance Pace Research and Innovation District — LEAP, for short — has been pitched as a future competitor with North Carolina’s Research Triangle. Developers with the IEDC landed on Boone County due to its location halfway between Indianapolis and Purdue University, with access to a major interstate. 
LEAP spending nears $1B with projected budget shielded, investigation finds

As of October, the IEDC has spent almost $427 million on roughly 5,800 acres tied to the project. Initially the state planned to purchase up to 11,000 acres.
Both of the parcels — at 2009 W 250 N and 1502 W 525 N in Lebanon — are listed for sale on Realtor.com with the same real estate agent. 
In a statement, the IEDC confirmed that those two homes are the only two currently listed for sale by the IEDC. 
“The IEDC is in the process of analyzing all land assets within the LEAP District. As part of that analysis, the IEDC identified two purchased properties that were necessary at the time for access and annexation, but no longer warrant the state maintaining to support current and future investments. For these reasons, it has been determined that the best path forward is to list and sell portions of these two properties, eliminating maintenance expenses and better aligning with the long-term vision for the site,” said Erin Sweitzer, who oversees communications for the IEDC.
“To date, the purchase of land and the development of the LEAP District has resulted in the IEDC securing more than $18 billion in committed long-term investments for critical life sciences, (research and development) and data center projects, with resulting land sale proceeds already being returned to the state’s general fund,” Sweitzer continued.
 The IEDC as real estate developer

From the beginning, the agency has said its purchases will not be kept in the long term, but rather sold to the companies investing in LEAP. 
Eli Lilly, the first announced tenant, bought 605 acres from the state in April 2023 for $60 million, breaking ground on a $4.5 billion facility last week in the first phase of its planned $18 billion investment. Outside of Lilly, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, has struck a “tentative deal.” No other companies have openly committed to the site.
One of the homes appears to be just north of the planned Lilly site, a single-acre site originally purchased for $840,000. The three-bedroom home is now listed for $649,900, a 23% price cut. 
The other house was part of a 20-acre purchase for $2.8 million. The slimmed down posting on Realtor.com includes eight acres and the original four-bedroom home and sits just south of where Prairie Creek intersects with Highway 52 — a place the LEAP website said could be used for mixed development or a village center. 
In 2023, the assessed value for the 12 acres was $47,500 while the house and eight acres was $819,500.

Long-time LEAP opponents celebrated the listings as a sign that the IEDC is “reconsidering” the project after years of pushback. 
“I guess it tells us that they’re reevaluating how they’re doing things and … realized that maybe they shouldn’t have bought quite so much or bitten off as much as what they’ve done,” said Brian Daggy, a Boone County resident. 
Daggy and other members of the Boone County Preservation Group have criticized the project’s lack of transparency, maintaining that the state shouldn’t act as a developer and potentially overpay to purchase land on the taxpayer dime.
“I have no objection … if a farmer gets an offer and wants to sell property for development. It’s his property; he has that right to do so,” said Daggy. “But when the state entity, such as IEDC, comes in and starts offering huge premiums for property and using taxpayer money with no accountability, it really … doesn’t lend itself to fiscal responsibility or oversight.” 
Daggy said his wife and fellow board member, Peggy, is a former realtor and noted the listings a few days before the “For Sale” sign appeared on the neighboring parcel. Like other area landowners, the state asked whether they’d be interested in selling their property. The Daggys declined.
The state “clearly overpaid” for the home on the northern edge of the Lilly allotment, Daggy said, and was an example of the state buying property with no clear objective. Lilly, even in older maps, has been the northern boundary for the LEAP project. 
“I don’t know of too many properties where, actually, the price has gone down in the last two years. If anything, appreciation has accelerated,” said Daggy. 
But Lebanon Mayor Matt Gentry said the sales don’t indicate any slowing or pivot on behalf of the LEAP project, noting that the IEDC is still responsible for maintaining and mowing homes they own. 
“Maybe the IEDC just came to the conclusion of, ‘Let’s just resell these to someone who wants to buy them,’” said Gentry. “They were probably more interested in the land that came with the purchase.”
Gentry led a nearly two-hour city council meeting Monday evening, during which the government body accepted eight small parcels for voluntary annexation explicitly as part of the LEAP taxing district. 
“I don’t think LEAP is slowing down at all,” Gentry concluded. 
 What’s ahead for IEDC, Lebanon?

The IEDC has been reticent to share LEAP details from the beginning, citing a need to keep ongoing negotiations private until it reaches a final deal. 
“I understand the frustration, certainly,” emphasized Gentry. “But, unfortunately, that’s kind of the nature of these economic development deals. We were talking with Meta for more than two years before they were willing to kind of publicly announce…”
  Lebanon Mayor Matt Gentry
Gentry pointed to the $4 billion SK hynix investment in Tippecanoe County, where developers have wrangled with locals to identify a potential location more than a year after announcing the planned advanced chip packaging facility. 
“I’ve always seen this as a 25- to 50-year project, so I’m not frustrated by the speed of it,” said Gentry, who acknowledged the national economic headwinds may slow current progress. “But, at the end of the day, the concept of LEAP is strong.”
But Daggy tied overall transparency concerns with a governor-ordered forensic audit of the IEDC’s finances. Gov. Mike Braun, who repeatedly criticized the quasi-public state agency during his gubernatorial run, also froze funds to an economic development “partner” and the IEDC’s foundation arm, the latter of which funded nearly all of former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s international travel. 
Results from that audit aren’t expected for months.
Daggy also noted that the state-purchased land in Boone County doesn’t supply valuable property tax dollars to the City of Lebanon — coinciding with a property tax restructuring that will further dent future incomes for local governments. 
The property tax plan championed by and signed into law by Braun will curb future property tax growth with the explicit goal of lowering bills for homeowners but will cost counties a combined $386 million in future revenues. 
Boone County accounts for $7 million of that loss, according to a fiscal note from late April. 
But Gentry noted that the owners of newly accepted annexed land weren’t paying property taxes to Lebanon in the first place. Those dollars were paid to county and township coffers.
 Additionally, farmland — which accounts for most of the purchases — is taxed at a lower property tax rate. 
“It’s worth some short-term loss while the land is assembled and planned for,” said Gentry. “In the long run, it will certainly generate way more in property taxes than it does today.”

From the headwaters at Three Forks downstream to Townsend, the Missouri River is designated as dewatered. That just hints at the size of the problem.
Consider all the dewatered rivers flowing into the Missouri River: the Gallatin, Jefferson, Dearborn, Smith, Teton, Musselshell, and Yellowstone Rivers. Consider too the dewatered rivers flowing into tributaries of the Missouri, like the Beaverhead, Big Hole, Boulder, Powder, and Tongue Rivers.
The State of Montana designated these rivers, or stretches of these rivers, as “significantly dewatered by man-caused flow depletions,” mostly from irrigation, also from dams and other causes.
Smaller streams too have been dewatered, such as Hyalite Creek, South Cottonwood Creek, Bozeman (Sourdough) Creek, and Bridger Creek near Bozeman; Tenmile Creek and Prickly Pear Creek that drain into the Helena valley; and the Little Prickly Pear that joins the Missouri below Holter Dam.
These are examples, not a complete list, of dewatered streams in the state. Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks compiled the list because water levels affect fisheries, particularly spawning and rearing habitats.
Water deficiencies harm riparian vegetation and wildlife, too.
Furthermore, erosion is a problem.
Erosion strips fertile topsoil, clogs waterways with sediments, carries nitrates and other pollutants into our streams, and weakens the soil’s ability to retain moisture and sequester carbon.
Our activities affect sediment production, transport, and storage. According to a new study in the journal Geology, the magnitude of erosion caused by our land uses “vastly exceeds erosion rates driven by the largest climate transitions that naturally occur on Earth.”
Logging and plowing are the major causes of the human-caused increase in erosion, according to that study.
The loss of vegetative cover caused by logging — whether clear-cutting, thinning, or even prescribed burns — exposes soil to the drying effects of sunlight and wind, and this contributes to erosion, increases fire danger, and warms water exposed to sunlight.
Soil as sediment pollutes the waterways of Montana.
In agriculture, the loss of fertile soil, fueled mostly by plowing but also by overapplication of chemicals, prompts farmers to convert historically agricultural lands to development. The proposed Black gravel pit south of Gallatin Gateway is just one example.
Modifying streamflows with dams and dredging also increases soil losses.
Channelization of the Missouri River for transportation and flood control dates back into the nineteenth century. Dams for irrigation and power production further alter the natural stream environment and negatively impact the river and riparian habitats.
Yes, the dams also provide water for municipal water systems and recreation.
But the dams directly and negatively affect species now listed under the Endangered Species Act. The Pallid sturgeon and the piping plover are two listed populations negatively affected by the dams on the Missouri River.
But the population of interior least tern has recovered sufficiently to be delisted.
Adequately funded, conservation works!
More cost efficient is prevention. Stop logging national forests lands that protect our watersheds. Require the flow of sufficient water in our streams. Limit polluting runoff. Protect our water!

Fredericks has been proud of the center’s reputation in the community. Tree Top currently is licensed for 33 children at a time. With schedules staggered for some children, there are a total of 39 currently enrolled.
The waiting list is nearly twice that size: 72 children. This week Fredericks put up one pinwheel for each waiting list occupant on the law in front of the center, along with some signs. “Child care wanted,” one sign said. “Quality child care should be a right” said another. “Not a luxury,” said a third.
On Tuesday Fredericks was 300 miles away, at the state Capitol in Madison. Tree Top was closed, and Fredericks says it will be closed again on Wednesday and the rest of this week.
It was a tough decision, she said — but one she and her staff felt was necessary to make a point to Wisconsin lawmakers.
“Without state investment the parents can’t afford to pay rising tuition and staff can’t afford to stay at low wages,” Fredericks told the Wisconsin Examiner. “With investment, we will see a rise in teachers going into the field, we will see an increase in available programs.”
That’s why she and her staff decided to join the statewide strike called by child care providers.
Balancing better wages, affordable fees
The strike is a response to action May 8 by the Republican majority on the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee to strip $480 million from Tony Evers’ proposed budget. The money would provide child care centers with an ongoing monthly stipend, continuing support first provided through federal COVID-19 pandemic relief funds.
Child care providers have credited the money for enabling them to increase the wages of child care teachers while avoiding increases in the fees that parents pay.
“I know that there are many people who think that because we care for very young children that we don’t count as teachers,” said Tree Top teacher Betsy Westlund at a combination press conference and rally on the Capitol steps Tuesday. “But the work we do is highly skilled and deeply critical to our society, the economy, and our communities.”
She described a common suggestion that child care providers hear when they talk about funding shortfalls: increase tuition and expand enrollment.
“Never mind the tuition is already so high that so few can afford it, and never mind how difficult it is to find teachers willing to work for low wages with no benefits,” Westlund said.
“No one considers supporting the quality of child care by supporting skilled teachers because they assume anyone will do,” she added. “And that hurts. Man, does that hurt — because I know how much I have to put in to become educated in early childhood.”
Republicans favor expanding employer child care tax credit; providers skeptical

“We are not just babysitting — we are laying the foundation for lifelong learning,” said Amber Haas, a fellow Tree Top teacher.
The organizers of the strike are calling it “State Without Child Care.” They’re doing it “so that our elected representatives, especially on the Joint Finance Committee, can actually have an idea of what is going to happen this summer,” said Corrine Hendrickson, co-founder of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN) and the operator of a family child care center in New Glarus.

At the Assembly’s floor session Tuesday afternoon, child care providers sat in the overhead gallery. On the floor, Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) introduced some by name, adding that they “are here in the Capitol to advocate for $480 million in the budget for living wages for teachers in early childhood education.”
While some providers are going all in with the strike, many say they cannot — but they are equally concerned about the issue.
Assessing the risk
Angela Norvold has grown her child care program in Hudson from a family day care  serving eight children to two centers, each licensed for 43 children. One is for younger kids and the other for older children, including 4-year-old kindergarten.
“We thought hard and as a team,” about closing for the strike, Norvold said in an interview. She and the center’s administrators decided to send a letter to parents asking for their input. “They agreed that we should stay open, and my fear was that if we closed we would lose those people for good,” she said.
There’s a child care shortage in Hudson, Norvold said. At the same time, she added, there are several providers in the area to choose from, but many have rooms that aren’t in use because they cannot find teachers.
“I don’t know that [closing] would be making a statement where we are,” Norvold said. At the same time, though, “we did have some parents volunteer to keep their children home so that we could come [to Madison] today and tomorrow.”
Norvold said that her centers were once more affordable than those in Minnesota, drawing families who moved across the border to make their home.
“They didn’t just come for lower prices, they came for quality care, educated staff that wanted to stay, and a community that values raising children well,” she said in a brief speech at the rally.  
The funding providers received during the pandemic “didn’t just help families, it helped providers,” Norvold said. “It helped us retain and educate staff, it helped us keep costs down without sacrificing quality. It helped us build futures.”
If the support doesn’t continue, “we’re looking at yet another tuition increase — at least $30 per child per week,” Norvold said. “That will push our infant care to a level that is not sustainable for most working families. It is not sustainable for us either.”
Families show support
Families of children enrolled at Tree Top in Ashland have gotten behind the center’s decision to join the child care strike .
“Our families support us,” Fredericks said. “They know that we have done everything. We’re contacting our legislators, they’re contacting our legislators —over and over again, telling them how important it is.”
Tony Singler is the father of three children who have gone through Tree Top’s program, from the age of 3 months though 4-year-old kindergarten. His youngest child is now nearing graduation from the 4-K program.
“Everything that Theresa does there is just more in-depth and more one-on-one,” Singler said in a telephone interview Tuesday. For his kids, he said, the center has been an ideal place to help their children through their first years.
“There’s a lot of research and support that the early years are very important to the children,” Singler said. “Our pediatrician supports that, and it’s a choice we make to give our children the best chance they have.”
Singler is a certified public accountant; his wife is a nurse. “We’re not teachers,” he said. “We don’t know how to teach kids at that young age.”
Now they are juggling schedules and turning to friends for help while hoping their child can return to Tree Top soon.
“It’s tough,” said Singler, but he says he understands the position that Fredericks and the center’s employees are in.
“It’s been a very good center,” he said. “And if they don’t have the funding, and they lose the teachers because the teachers have to go somewhere else, and they have to cut the enrollment and people get cut — then you don’t have the opportunity to put your child into the center like that, give them the best chance forward in their early development.”

A new study suggests that direct financial aid reduces parole violations and eases reentry. (Photo courtesy of the Center for Employment Opportunities)When Karina Lariz was released from a California prison in September 2021, she had only the clothes she was arrested in — stretched out and weathered by time. She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.
With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.

– Karina Lariz, cash assistance recipient


The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.
According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
 Legislation and pilot programs

A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.
This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
 Potential savings

In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.
Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Republican lawmakers have filed a proposed bill expanding an existing state business development tax credit related to child care. Child care providers who want to see a permanent state investment in their work said the bill was an inadequate gesture.
The state’s current business tax credit for child care applies only to capital expenditures for an employee child care program. The proposed bill would expand that to include other costs, including operating a child care program for employees, reimbursing employees for child care costs and other costs related to child care benefits.

“These changes will increase the number of available child care slots and provide more options for families,” wrote Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Rep. Karen Hurd (R-Withee) in a memo seeking cosponsors. “While not a silver bullet, these changes are another step in the right direction to address the child care issue in Wisconsin.”
Critics dismissed the measure as inadequate.
In a press release Rep. Randy Udell (D-Fitchburg) sent out after the Assembly’s floor session Tuesday, he noted that last week the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee “shot down 612 budget items including $480 million in childcare funding, and they proposed a childcare tax credit in its place that would benefit corporations instead of childcare providers under threat of closure.”
Shawn Phetteplace, national campaigns director for Main Street Alliance, sent a memo to lawmakers Tuesday also dismissing the proposal.
“Providing a 15% refundable business tax credit for businesses providing child care benefits will not appreciably increase access to child care for Wisconsin workers,” Phetteplace wrote. “It will simply be another tax break for large corporations. A similar credit exists at the federal level, the 45F credit, which is widely regarded as not achieving the goal of increasing affordability and accessibility to childcare for employees.”
Corrine Hendrickson, co-founder of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), said at a Capitol rally Tuesday she would like to meet with Marklein, who cochairs the finance committee, as well as Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) the other cochair.
The business tax credit is refundable: The credit recipient receives the full value of the credit back from the state, even if it is more than what the recipient owes in taxes. Hendrickson criticized the lawmakers for “refusing to do the same for our hard-working families with the child and dependent tax credit.”
The state’s child and dependent care tax credit for families, which was expanded in legislation enacted in March 2024, is not refundable. That effectively makes the tax credit worth much more to people with higher incomes than to those with lower incomes, as the Wisconsin Examiner has previously reported.
“We are not going to accept anything more that will entrench the wealthy and well connected into our system of having success in life,” Hendrickson said.
Born issued a statement this week that declared Republicans were focusing on other alternatives to the proposal for $480 million in subsidies for child care providers.
“Legislative Republicans have consistently supported a targeted approach to helping families afford child care, build provider capacity, and support recruitment of child care professionals,” Born said. “Parents are best equipped to make decisions about the needs of their children and Legislative Republicans are committed to providing parents with options, helping families directly make child care more affordable.”
Born said the Legislature spends “almost $1 billion” for child care. 
Hendrickson said that virtually all that money is from the federal government and simply passes through the state budget. Only about $24.4 million comes from the state as a required match.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Through April, state revenues are $97.7 million below the Idaho Legislature’s forecast for the current 2025 fiscal year, according to a new monthly revenue report released by the Idaho Legislative Services Office.
Although revenue collections are more than they were last year at this time, they are below the Idaho Legislature’s forecast for the current fiscal year, according to the April edition of the Fiscal Year 2025 General Fund Budget Monitor report.
That’s important because the Idaho Legislature used the forecast in the state’s 2025 fiscal year budget.

When legislators left the Idaho State Capitol in Boise at the end of the 2025 session, they were forecasting to end the 2025 fiscal year on June 30 with a positive ending balance of $420.3 million.
But just over a month later, the projected ending balance has shrunk to $322.7 million, according to the new budget monitor report.
“Thats why we left such a strong ending balance,” said Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as the co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC.
JFAC is a powerful legislative committee that sets every budget for every state agency and department.

“At the time we adjourned Sine Die there were questions about the impacts of tariffs, and we gave more tax relief than the governor proposed,” Horman added, using the Latin phrase Sine Die that signifies the annual legislative session  has ended for the year “We wanted to make sure we had a cushion there to cover us – not only through the end of this fiscal year, but also carrying over to start FY26, and that’s what we did.”
“At this time, we are still very well positioned moving into the next fiscal year,” Horman said.
  Sales tax distribution seems to be main factor in state revenue picture 

Idaho’s budget runs on a calendar where fiscal year 2025 ends June 30 and fiscal year 2026 begins July 1.
For fiscal year 2025, the Idaho Legislature adopted a revenue figure that was $42.1 million higher than the revenue projection Gov. Brad Little and the Idaho Division of Financial Management issued.
Sales tax distributions appear to be a major driving factor in the revenue picture.
The state’s April revenue report indicates sales tax distributions to the state’s general fund are $95.6 million less than last year.
In a written statement Tuesday, Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff said she does not foresee the need for any holdbacks in the current budget.
With the April revenue numbers coming in, Wolff said the state is still within 1% of its revenue projections.
“The governor and the Legislature left $400 million on the bottom line as cushion, and we do not anticipate any holdbacks will be necessary for FY25,” Wolff wrote Tuesday. “The Governor’s Office and (Division of Financial Management) will continue to monitor revenue, but the strength of our economy combined with responsible budgeting do not create any significant concerns about the state budget at this time.”
 Boise Democrat worries cuts may be coming to next year’s budget 

With only two months left in the 2025 fiscal year, it doesn’t look like the state will have a problem finishing this year with a balanced budget.

But Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, is worried that revenue cuts approved by legislators could lead the Idaho Legislature to cut funding for programs Idahoans depend on during next year’s legislative session.
“It may cause some havoc; in the next session we may see the Legislature cutting things,” Wintrow said in a phone interview Tuesday.
“Overall what I am deeply disturbed by – and what we are seeing in revenue collections – is I don’t think Gov. Little or the Idaho Legislature is keeping its promises to Idahoans,” Wintrow added.
In addition to serving as the leader of the Democrats in the Idaho Senate, Wintrow is a member of the Legislature’s budget committee, JFAC.

During the 2025 legislative session, Idaho legislators cut taxes by about $400 million and provided an additional $50 million in a refundable tax credit for education expenses including tuition at a private, religious school.
In a press conference Monday, Little said the state can afford the $400 million in tax cuts this year, but it’s important to consider the future.
To pay for the tax cuts and tax credits, legislators reduced revenue that is available for funding in the state budget by about $453 million.
Some of the Idaho Legislature’s laws, like 2024’s House Bill 521, divert sales tax revenue away from the general fund and put it to other uses, like paying for school facilities or reducing other taxes.
  Diverting sales tax revenue before it hits Idaho’s general fund

On Tuesday, Horman did say she is concerned about the sales tax revenue diverted away before it reaches the state general fund. She said she first spoke out about the issue a couple of years ago.
“There has been a concern as we continue to draw from gross sales tax revenues in a way that distributes them before they are appropriated that we need to be cautious that the percentage going to cities and counties doesn’t get so out of balance that when the next recession hits they feel the worst of the brunt of reduced revenues,” Horman said.
Wintrow is also concerned about diverting sales tax revenue before it reaches the general fund budget.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Instead of cutting income taxes and diverting sales tax revenue, Wintrow said legislators should push to increase funding for special education programs and increase pay for state employees.
Between the revenue cuts and Republican legislators announcing a new Idaho Department of Government Efficiency task force that seeks to consolidate state agencies and reduce the number of state employees – an effort similar to the Trump administration’s and Elon Musk’s DOGE process –, Wintrow worries cuts to programs are coming next year.
“Its not very conservative to hack your revenue stream so hard it potentially puts us in a place where we may have to continue to whittle at the oak tree until it’s a splinter,” Wintrow said.
“Many of us (Democrats), and some Republicans, really were raising the alarm bell on that, to cut revenue so deeply at a time when the economy is going haywire.”
The new April budget monitor report isn’t the first sign that revenues were lagging projections. Little’s budget office released a preliminary revenue report in March that showed revenues were lagging behind state projections at that point.
JFAC is scheduled to conduct interim committee meetings next week in Idaho Falls. JFAC members are scheduled to receive a general fund and budget update Monday.

House Bill 4202 would allow individuals who have a physician’s verification that they are at least 10 weeks pregnant by the end of the tax year to claim their fetus as a dependent.
It’s a straightforward “pro-family” bill, the bill’s sponsor Rep. Gina Johnsen (R-Lake Orion) told members of the state House Finance committee Tuesday. Johnsen said the bill would work to recognize the financial responsibilities that residents endure during pregnancy and promote growth in the state economy as families are incentivized to grow.
“This bill does not create a new entitlement. It does not expand government bureaucracy, and it does not affect Michigan’s legal definitions related to personhood or abortion. It simply applies the same logic and fairness we already use for children born or lost late in the year to a pregnancy that is ongoing under medical care,” Johnsen said. “This is a modest but meaningful bill that gives expecting mothers an added measure of support without creating a new program or imposing additional burdens on the state.”

Though bills to offer tax relief during pregnancy can sound like a positive thing for residents, it’s a common undercover tactic for state-level attempts to establish “fetal personhood” in order to chip away at abortion rights, Planned Parenthood Action Fund said in a memo at the start of last year. Other “fetal personhood” bills can look like efforts to allow pregnant people to pursue child support after conception and separate criminal and civil penalties for death of fetuses, placing the same level of personhood on fetuses as children.
“Legislative tactics and messaging of the fetal personhood movement may change, but the goal is the same — to control people’s bodies, limit their health care choices, and criminalize people for having abortions,” Planned Parenthood Action Fund’s memo says. “These laws are not about supporting pregnant people…Instead, they are purposefully sowing confusion and slowly chipping away at people’s rights to make reproductive health decisions.”
Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport) inquired if there was room to adjust the minimum weeks required under the exemption noting that under the bill’s rules a person could claim the tax exemption at the end of the year and promptly terminate the pregnancy in the 11th week of pregnancy or beyond. Johnsen noted that the 10 week minimum was already a compromise.
About 93% of all abortions in the U.S. are initiated within the first trimester, or 13 weeks of pregnancy, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) said she had some reservations on the bill but would be interested in seeing it tie-barred to only pass if the “Momnibus” package, addressing disproportionate maternal mortality for moms of color, also passes the Legislature. Breen proposed an amendment to tie-bar the bills, though it was voted down by Republican committee members.
“Thank you to the sponsor for recognizing the need for additional supports for pregnant women and working moms…There’s a lot of good that could come from the “Momnibus” package, and that’s why I’ve asked for this amendment to tie bar your bill to it,” Breen said before the vote on her amendment.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Facetune_11-03-2024-23-10-54-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 07:04:47.478702

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin State Assembly, in a departure from prior floor debates this session, passed several widely bipartisan bills related to health care, including one to exempt direct primary care services from insurance laws and another to allow pharmacist to prescribe birth control.
AB 43 would allow pharmacists to prescribe certain birth control, including the pill and contraceptive patches, to patients 18 and older as a way of making it easier to access. Currently, Wisconsin patients have to make an appointment with a doctor or advanced practice nurse and answer a mandatory list of questions regarding their health before a doctor could prescribe birth control. Once a physician determines it safe, patients can take a prescription to a pharmacy to be filled. 
Under the bill, pharmacists would have to give patients a self-assessment questionnaire and do blood pressure screening. If there are any “red flags,” then a pharmacist would need to refer  patients to see a physician.
Rep. Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay) said during a press conference ahead of the session that the process included in the bill is “much more rigorous” than when women get birth control online. He said it would also help women with family planning, noting that about half of pregnancies in Wisconsin are unplanned each year.
“These women are unlikely to finish school, and it will severely affect their potential earnings throughout their lives…” Kitchens said. “Birth control is 99.9% effective when it’s used according to directions and regularly. The lack of access is the biggest reason that it sometimes fails. Women will leave home for a couple of days and forget about it, or they can’t make an appointment with their doctor, and this bill is going to help with all of that.” 
This is the fourth time the Assembly has passed a similar bill. Last session, it passed a Senate committee but it never came for a floor vote. 
Kitchens said he thinks there is a “good chance the Senate will pass it this time.” 
Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek) said in a statement that the policy “will increase access to contraceptives, particularly for women who live in rural areas, where many Wisconsinites live closer to their pharmacy than they do to their doctor’s office,” and urged her Senate colleagues to take up the bill. 
“This is a good bill that will make for greater access to contraception. I have voted for this proposal four sessions in a row. I urge the Senate to follow our lead,” Rodriguez said. 
The bill passed 87-10 with only Republican lawmakers voting against. 
Primary care insurance exemption
SB 4 would exempt direct primary care, which is a health care model where patients pay a monthly or annual fee to a physician or practice for access to primary care services, from insurance laws. Advocates have said that clarifying that insurance law doesn’t apply to direct primary care doctors would encourage more providers to opt in to this model.
Bill author Rep. Cindi Duchow (R-Town of Delafield) said at a press conference that direct primary care “is not insurance.” 
“It’s a private contract you have with the doctor, then you have insurance for something catastrophic — if you need to have surgery or you have a heart attack, you have insurance to cover that — but this is just for your everyday needs, and it’s more one-on-one, and you have more personal experiences with the doctors,” Duchow said. 
Rep. Robyn Vining  (D-Wauwatosa) expressed concerns about the bill, noting that it is missing nondiscrimination language and that she would be voting against it.
“[This] is getting us nowhere helpful,” Vining said. 
The nondiscrimination language, Vining referenced, was in relation to prohibiting discrimination on the basis of “gender identity.” Conservative organizations had lobbied against the bill last session due to the inclusion of that language and it never received a vote in the Senate.
Vining expressed concerns that Evers might veto the bill without the nondiscrimination language. 
Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) said she had similar concerns but would be voting for it. 
“I think it is a good bill, and it does something that is important, but I do it knowing that I wish the bill could be stronger,” Subeck said. 
The Assembly concurred in SB 4 in a voice vote. The Senate passed the bill in March, and it will now head to Evers’ desk.
Lawmakers also concurred in SB 14, a bill to require written informed consent from a patient when a hospital performs a pelvic examination for educational purposes on a patient while the patient is under general anesthesia or otherwise unconscious. The bill was advocated for by Sarah Wright, a teacher who was subjected to a nonconsensual pelvic exam while she was undergoing abdominal surgery in Madison in 2009. 
Subeck said it is a “horrifying” story that Wright has shared every legislative session. 
“[Wright] was unconscious. There was no medical need for a pelvic exam and medical students were brought in to do public exams in order to learn the procedure because it’s easy as to learn on an unconscious individual,” Subeck said. “This is tantamount to sexual assault. This is not giving consent. This is assuming consent from somebody who is unconscious.” 
Subeck noted in a statement that lawmakers have been working on the legislation for over a decade. 
“It has taken far too long, but we are finally honoring her bravery by putting an end to this disturbing and unethical practice,” Subeck said in a statement. “Patients entrust medical professionals with their care at their most vulnerable moments. That trust must never be violated. Performing a medically unnecessary and invasive exam without consent is not only a breach of ethics — it is a violation that can feel indistinguishable from sexual assault.”
Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) noted that one study found that over 80% of medical students at major training hospitals reported performing pelvic exams on anaesthetized patients, but only 17% said that the patients were informed, while nearly half reported that the patients were rarely or never explicitly told so. 
“I am really thankful for the bipartisan support,” Goeben said. 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said in a statement ahead of the session that the bills were a sign that lawmakers could work across partisan lines, but said they could do more. 
“It is possible to come together to pass good, bipartisan bills that will move our state forward — but we know that there is so much work left to be done,” Neubauer said. “Just last week, Republicans on the Joint Finance Committee cut proposals by [Evers] that would have lowered costs for working families and cut taxes for the majority of Wisconsinites. Removing these critical proposals from consideration and preventing future discussion is ridiculous, and on top of this, the GOP has refused to have public hearings, let alone votes, on popular and bipartisan legislation that would move our state forward.”
Ahead of the floor session, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) told reporters that work on the budget is on hold until legislative leaders meet in person with Evers. Republican lawmakers are seeking a tax cut in the budget. 
“Our preferred option [is] to be able to get an agreed upon tax cut so that we know we have X dollars to invest in schools and health care and all the other things that are important,” Vos said. “It’s pretty hard for us to move forward… I think we’re kind of on pause until we hear back from Gov. Evers.”

The Idaho Legislature widely approved the new law through House Bill 134 this year. But the law doesn’t take effect until Jan. 1, 2026. 
The new law will require health insurance companies to cover supplemental breast cancer screening when abnormalities aren’t found or suspected in the breast of people who are at high risk.
“Early detection saves lives, and I’m thrilled to have helped pass this impactful legislation that will make life-saving care more affordable and accessible for so many Idaho women at high risk for breast cancer,” Rep. Brooke Green, a Boise Democrat who sponsored the bipartisan-backed legislation while she battles breast cancer, said in a written statement. 
Days after her first breast cancer diagnosis, Green’s radiologist brought the issue to her attention, she previously told the Sun. In a show of solidarity, several Idaho lawmakers shaved their heads in late March, as Green prepared to start chemotherapy.

 How the bill works: No extra patient cost for an extra screening in-network

Under the bill, people will be considered at high risk for breast cancer due to personal or family history, genetic predisposition or other factors. Supplemental breast cancer screening required to be covered by the bill includes magnetic resonance imaging, or an MRI. 
Idaho legislators shave heads to support colleague, raise awareness for breast cancer screening

According to a news release last week by the Idaho Department of Insurance, the new law requires health insurance plans cover “all costs associated with one supplemental breast cancer screening every year” for people covered by their health insurance plans who have a high risk of breast cancer. 
Here’s how that will work:

That screening “must be covered with no patient cost-sharing,” which includes deductibles, copayments or coinsurance, if it is provided by in-network health care providers, the Idaho Department of Insurance says. 
Additional costs can be charged for services from out-of-network providers. 
For other breast imaging services that go beyond the new law’s minimum service requirements, such as diagnostic imaging or supplemental screenings conducted more than once a year, the health insurance plan’s patient cost-sharing rules can apply, the insurance department says.

Idaho health insurance companies must update their plan documents and notify members about the new benefits, according to new guidance to insurers from the Idaho Department of Insurance. 
“Consumers should contact their insurer with any questions, or contact our department if they experience coverage issues,” Idaho Department of Insurance Market Oversight Bureau Chief Shannon Hohl said in a written statement. “Our consumer affairs team is available to help with insurance questions and concerns.”
In a written statement, Idaho Department of Insurance Director Dean Cameron thanked the Legislature and several lawmakers for supporting the bill, saying it will “help Idahoans access the critical preventive services they need.”

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)An Indiana Department of Health report released in April shows a total of 146 abortions occurred in 2024 – a 98% decrease from 2022. This is the first annual terminated pregnancy report in which the state’s near-total abortion ban was in full effect. 
Ninety-three of the abortions were performed due to lethal fetal anomaly; 40 were due to serious health risk or life of the mother and nine were due to rape or incest.
More than half were performed by using an abortion pill or intracardiac injections.The rest were surgical procedures. 
In 2023, while the ban was partially in effect, there were a total of 4,579 abortions performed in Indiana. Before the ban was in effect in 2022, there were a total of 9,529 abortions. 
Half of the women who obtained an abortion were between the ages of 25-34 while only two were under the age of 16. Nearly half of the women indicated they were married. 
Under the state’s ban, abortions can only be done in hospitals.

Nine hospitals in Marion, Allen and St. Joseph counties carried out the abortions. There were 67 terminations reported at Riley Health Maternity Tower and 52 reported at Sidney & Lois Eskanazi Hospital. Both of these hospitals are located in Indianapolis. 
Indiana law requires that health care providers who perform terminated pregnancies report to the IDOH. Providers must report within 30 days if the patient is 16 or older and within three days if younger than 16. Each of the reports should include demographic, medical and procedural information. 
While 142 terminated pregnancies reports were submitted to the IDOH through the electronic reporting system, Indiana University Health submitted four incomplete reports via email that lacked demographic, medical and procedural details. The reports did include that they occurred at an IU Health facility in 2024 but did not report all the required information.  
Two doctors from IU Health testified in March that they haven’t submitted the reports since Dec. 23 — when a new federal rule on reproductive health care privacy went into effect.
In January, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun signed new executive orders on abortion records to ensure the laws are “fully and faithfully executed,” including terminated pregnancy report submissions. 
In February, the Indiana Department of Health settled with an anti-abortion group – backed by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita – to continue to release individual reports filed on abortion after opting to no longer release these reports due to patient privacy concerns in December 2023.
A judge, however, blocked that release.

Although mysterious water color cleared up over the course of winter, Little Soda Lake is already dealing with water quality issues.
The post Post-thaw, Pinedale’s red lake quickly tagged as Wyoming’s first ‘harmful’ cyanobacteria bloom of 2025 appeared first on WyoFile .","A once-prized trout fishery in the Pinedale area that raised concerns in late 2024 when it turned the color of a taconite tailings pond is again struggling with water quality. 
The ice just came off many lakes along the Wind River Range’s western front, including Little Soda Lake, which shed its deep red color over the winter. Yet almost immediately — within just a few weeks at most — environmental regulators detected potential issues with the still-frigid water. Samples were taken by the Bridger-Teton National Forest last week, and results just came in. 
“A harmful cyanobacteria bloom recreational use bloom advisory has been issued for Little Soda Lake,” Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality officials announced in a public notice Monday. 
Notably, the bloom detected in the high-elevation water body, located at 7,600 feet and just a half-mile from crystal clear Fremont Lake, marks Wyoming’s first verified harmful cyanobacteria bloom of 2025, according to the state’s monitoring website.

Harmful cyanobacteria blooms are often associated with warm weather and nutrient pollution, like runoff from agricultural operations, though they can also plague the backcountry. Occurrences typically pick up pace late in the summer and early fall. 
While Little Soda Lake harboring Wyoming’s first harmful cyanobacteria bloom of the year is surprising, it’s unclear if the potentially toxic water is a remnant from last year. 
“It’s unknown, but a warmer-than-average winter combined with recent warm weather may be contributing to conditions that allow HCBs to appear earlier than usual,” DEQ spokeswoman Kimberly Mazza wrote in an email.

DEQ was able to acquire a cyanotoxin sample, Mazza said. Results are pending, but eventually the sample will give the state agency more insight into the toxicity of the cyanobacteria suspected to be a factor in Little Soda Lake’s crimson color. 
Land managers and environmental regulators should learn a lot about what’s going on in Little Soda Lake in 2025. The water body will be sampled monthly, according to DEQ’s 2025 sampling and analysis plan. 
Routine monthly monitoring is typically reserved for lakes that have “high to very high” access and recreational use and toxic bloom potential. Exceptions were made for Brooks Lake and Little Soda Lake.
“These waterbodies were classified as very high priority due to significant public interest,” DEQ’s plan says.

Political parties should stand on their own two feet, and not come running to government to referee their frat-house pissing matches, columnist Rod Miller opines. 
The post It’s high time for Wyoming to privatize political parties appeared first on WyoFile .","It has become a predictable annual event, like the first tourist getting tossed ass over teacup by a Yellowstone buffalo. It is the “free space” on the Cowboy State’s political bingo card. I am, of course, talking about the Wyoming Republican Party getting into an intramural food fight, and then coming to the government of Wyoming to sort things out.

Opinion

I see that the Wyoming Republican Party is suing itself again in our state courts, this time over credentials in the state Central Committee leadership elections. The attorney for the GOP went so far as to say that, since the party is a private organization, it doesn’t need to abide by Wyoming statutes or pay attention to Wyoming Supreme Court decisions.
The irony in this situation is thick as harness leather.
At the risk of repeating myself, I’ll repeat myself. The sovereign State of Wyoming needs to cut the apron strings that bind political parties to state government. The Wyoming Legislature should go through Title 22, our election code, with a fine-toothed comb, and pluck out any reference to political parties contained therein.
It makes absolutely no sense to have laws on our books that govern the internal workings of private organizations like political parties, and then have those parties ignore the law. The State of Wyoming doesn’t tell the Rotary Club how to conduct its internal elections, any more than it tells the Elks Club what to include on its buffet menu.
Political parties, like service clubs or lodges, are private membership organizations and should be allowed to conduct their business by their own rules. Government has no place monkeying around in them, unless their rituals involve human sacrifice or fissionable material.
Private political parties should also stand on their own two feet, and not come running to government to referee their frat-house pissing matches. When they resort to appealing to government to settle their internal differences, political parties make themselves look like weak little wards of the state who can’t handle disputes among themselves, instead of the proud paragons of political thought that they like to call themselves.
Here, as I see it, is the only nexus between political parties in Wyoming and government. The parties can, if they choose to do so, submit a slate of candidates to the Secretary of State and county clerks for inclusion on the general election ballot. Once that is done, the relationship is over. Basta. Finito. End of story.
How the parties derive those names should be totally up to them. There is no need for government to conduct primary elections at public expense to accommodate private organizations such as political parties.
If the Democrats want to have an axe-throwing tournament to choose their candidates, then so be it. If the Republicans want to conduct a swimsuit competition to choose theirs, fine and dandy. It is not government’s business to interfere.
And this nonsense about the parties controlling vacant seats in government by submitting three names to the governor for selection needs to go! Those seats belong to the citizens of Wyoming, not to any political party. If a seat becomes vacant, then a special election should be held to fill it. Let voters decide, not party hacks.
Political parties are useless appendages on our body politic. They have meaning only to their members and, outside that small circle, they only offer entertainment value to the rest of us.
Wyoming’s state lawmakers would do everyone a favor if they’d re-read Madison’s cautionary advice about political factions in the Federalist Papers #10, then take a chainsaw to our election code. Free the parties to be the private outfits they want to be, and liberate the rest of us from their partisan goofiness.
Selah.

(Photo via ICE)Wisconsin Republicans continued their push Tuesday for a bill that would require local law enforcement to report people charged with a felony to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) if they cannot verify their immigration status. Legislative leaders are also demanding that state government officials cooperate with and support President Donald Trump’s deportation agenda.
State legislatures across the country have taken action to either require or prohibit local law enforcement cooperation. According to a Stateline report, experts have said jails are the easiest place to pick up people for deportation and when local law enforcement cooperates there are more arrests. Noncooperation in states, including California, is leading to a decreased number of arrests and deportations.
Amanda Merkwae, advocacy director for the ACLU of Wisconsin,  testified against the legislation before the Senate Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs Committee Tuesday. Merkwae detailed extensive actions the Trump administration has taken to target immigrants since the bill was first introduced by lawmakers and cautioned against having local law enforcement play a larger role in those efforts.
Merkwae quoted a former North Carolina sheriff who said at a 2008 conference about the role of local police in immigration enforcement, “if you don’t have enough evidence to charge someone criminally, but you think he’s illegal, we can make him disappear.”
“A lot has happened even since the Assembly public hearing on this bill back in February,” Merkwae said, reeling off a list including “the disappearing of legal residents to gulags without due process,” “inappropriately invoking the Alien Enemies Act to remove people,” to “escalating violent arrests” by masked Department of Homeland Security agents, detaining students and activists for exercising their First Amendment rights in ICE facilities, arbitrarily canceling student visas, “threatening to disappear U.S. citizens to El Salvador,” “and just this week — and it’s only Tuesday — eliminating temporary protective status of thousands of immigrants despite a court order, blocking the entry of refugees who spent years getting approved through a lengthy process while living in refugee camps and third countries and the administration openly exploring the suspension of habeas corpus.”
“When the federal government is violating the Constitution, we must resist pressures to integrate local governance into its abuses,” she said. 
The Assembly passed the bill in March along party lines, and Gov. Tony Evers has vowed to veto it. Lawmakers introduced the bill just three weeks into Trump’s new term.
Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) and Rep. Jim Piwowarczyk (R-Hubertus) said the bill is narrow and seeks to help ensure that Wisconsin is safe.
“This proposal will make it easier to remove dangerous criminals from our communities. It’s shocking to think that a handful in law enforcement and our government would rather protect felons than work with our federal partners to stop the flow of crime and drugs into our neighborhoods,” Bradley said. 
Since March, the number of Wisconsin counties with official agreements to cooperate with ICE has grown to 12, including Washington, Waupaca, Winnebago and Wood. Two counties — Dane and Milwaukee — have previously been identified by ICE as noncooperative. 
Milwaukee County has become a focal point of controversy over ICE cooperation. Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested and indicted on charges of obstructing federal agents and concealing a person to prevent an arrest. ICE has arrested at least four people since March at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Republicans have also accused Evers of being noncooperative after he told state employees to contact a lawyer before handing over information if ICE showed up at their office buildings.
“I am deeply concerned that some local jurisdictions, including Dane County and Milwaukee County, have severely limited their cooperation with ICE. Many, if not most, Wisconsin sheriffs are already doing everything they can to identify the legal immigrants in their jails and cooperate with ICE holds,” Piwowarczyk said. “This bill won’t affect them. It will affect those who refuse, imperiling the safety of all Wisconsin citizens.”
The bill — AB 24 — would require local law enforcement to check the citizenship status of people in custody for  felony offenses and notify ICE if their citizenship can’t be verified. It also requires sheriffs to comply with detainers and administrative warrants received from the Department of Homeland Security regarding people held in the county jail for a criminal offense. If a sheriff refuses to comply with the law, the county would face a 15% deduction in its state aid payment the following year.
Merkwae said that the bill authors were taking a narrow reading of the bill, but “with 15% of an entire county’s share revenues on the line,” this will lead to sheriffs erring on the “side of overreporting.”
Democrats on the committee had an array of concerns about the bills, especially given the actions that the Trump administration has taken since the start of his term. 
Larson asked lawmakers whether they trusted ICE. 
“You’re throwing your trust in ICE — that 10 out of 10 [times] ICE is doing the right thing, 10 out of 10 times ICE is only taking people who have committed felonies and following the guidance of the president,” Larson said. “I don’t trust this federal government because [President Trump] came out on the record and said, ‘I don’t know if people deserve due process, I don’t know if I’m supposed to uphold the Constitution.’ Those are the words of the person who’s in charge of the administration.” 
Bradley said he rejected the premise of Larson’s question. 
“We aren’t empowering ICE,” Bradley said. “We don’t have the power to empower ICE. That’s not what we’re doing. We’re telling the sheriffs to cooperate with the federal government as they’re required to because we have instances where people have publicly come out and said, we will not cooperate… In this bill, [people] have also committed and are being charged with a felony. That’s what this bill is about.”
Larson corrected lawmakers several times when they said the only people covered in the bill had committed a crime: “75 of the people shipped overseas to El Salvador prison have no criminal history, and so this seems like an effort to jump on that bandwagon.” 
“Accused,” Larson said at one point. “Accused. You keep forgetting that part — alleged.” 
Sen. Tim Carpenter (D-Milwaukee) said he also doesn’t trust the current system, especially as ICE isn’t being transparent about its work. 
“It seems like it’s more of a campaign pitch to grab as many people as you can, but there are people that are innocent,” Carpenter said, adding that he fears that the bill if passed is “legitimizing a system that is not doing what we wanted it to do.”
Carpenter noted he has the largest Latino population among Wisconsin Senate districts. From events hosted in the district and conversations with constituents, he said, it’s “very noticeable that people are scared, and they don’t want to have someone — they’re innocent and get caught up in the system and end up in El Salvador.” 
Carpenter told the bill authors to try to convince him that the bill won’t further affect those communities.
“How do we deal with that impact on a sizable community — many of whom have done nothing wrong?” Carpenter asked. 
“I think the best thing that could happen is if people were honest about what this bill does, because by not being honest or conflating issues, what we’re doing is we’re spreading that fear,” Bradley said. “So, if you are here illegally and you are being charged with a felony, this bill, this applies to you, and you should be concerned. If not, you shouldn’t be concerned.”
Larson asked why there is a financial penalty in the bill, saying the premise of the bill appears to  be that law enforcement must cooperate “or we’re cutting your damn funding.” 
“If they’re not cooperating with ICE and are not doing what they’re supposed to do to keep their community safe, there should be a penalty and the penalty should be felt,” Bradley said. 
“Do you think the sheriff’s department will be able to keep communities safe by cutting them?” Larson asked. 
“If they follow the guidance in the bill, they won’t have to worry about that,” Bradley said.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun warned  that Indiana needs swift solutions for its bevy of water and energy “challenges” to support the state’s expanding manufacturing sector.
The Republican governor gave candid remarks at a fireside chat at the 2025 Indianapolis Investment Forum held Tuesday at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
He touted Indiana as “the biggest manufacturing state in the country” and hoped for the Hoosier State “to be on the leading edge of the new base load.” Currently, though, “we clearly don’t have enough electricity.” 
“Right now, (Indiana has) all kinds of opportunities that straddle AI and technology. We’ve got the biggest two issues, probably in the state, that have come out of nowhere — the availability of water and electricity,” Braun said. “Neither one of those was on the horizon. But if you’re going to tap into that new technology, you’ve got to have it.”
Utilities based in Indiana currently produce just 20 gigawatts of electricity, Braun emphasized. A single data center could consume 5% of that total capacity.
Data centers are choosing Indiana. Is the state’s electricity supply ready?

Indiana is already home to more than four dozen data centers — powerhouses for the AI boom. Citizens Action Coalition, a utility-focused customer advocacy group, has tracked nearly 30 more energy-demanding facilities that have been proposed across the state.
Part of the issue, Braun said, “is we’re shutting down our coal fleet prematurely.” Had Indiana “known” earlier that an influx of data centers and other development would create such an energy demand, “then we wouldn’t be in the pickle we’re in now — because we were so dependent on (coal).”
“If you don’t keep up with it, you’re going to pay even more for it,” Braun continued, referring to energy generation. “You’ve got to get a little bit out of your comfort zone.”
An ongoing, statewide push seeks to attract various high-tech industries to Indiana. Braun said data centers, in particular, “want to come here because we’re at least one of the 15 states blessed with some water.” Even so, it’s a resource that Indiana “doesn’t have in abundance.”
The governor said Indiana’s energy future “will probably be small modular reactors,” or SMRs. State lawmakers, with Braun’s support, already adopted new nuclear energy incentives during the 2025 session.
“I see an unbelievable opportunity, if again, we can set the stage,” Braun said about SMR technology, although nuclear developments are likely still a decade away. “I hope to be the first guy. We’re leading a consortium of them to get out on the leading edge.”
And with more manufacturing comes a need for even more STEM-trained workers, Braun added. 
The governor said he’ll largely judge his administration’s achievements by its economic development gains — particularly around workforce development, skills training and attracting young talent for careers in emerging technologies. 
“Are we getting more of our own kids to come back to Indiana, to raise a family, and start a business?” Braun asked. “If we can measure that, and do it well … we would call it a real success.”

The list of Trump administration cuts to vital public services has become so long and destructive that it’s easy to get overwhelmed, but as North Carolina anti-poverty advocates continue to remind us, it’s important to hold the cuts up to the light, to document their cruel illogic.
Take, for instance, the disastrous scheme to eliminate the AmeriCorps program. As the North Carolina Housing Coalition reported last week, it’s suing over the planned elimination of this program that will cause thousands of dedicated young people and seniors to be summarily fired.
Here in North Carolina, AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Senior volunteers serve at more than 700 locations across the state, including schools, food banks, homeless shelters, health clinics, veterans’ facilities, and other nonprofit and faith-based organizations.
The bottom line: The Trump administration is gutting scores of vital programs like this, all so that it can dispense more big tax cuts that chiefly benefit the top one percent. And the cruel shortsightedness of it all is hard to overstate.

(Photo: Federal Emergency Management Agency)Under proposed new federal disaster aid thresholds designed to reduce the amount of funding distributed to states following natural disasters, Tennessee would have lost 37% of the assistance it received after disasters from 2008 to 2024, according to research from Urban Institute.
A memo sent from former Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Cameron Hamilton to the White House Office of Management and Budget suggested quadrupling the damage threshold for federal aid, CNN reported in late April.
Nonprofit think tank Urban Institute analyzed 870 major disaster declarations that received public assistance grants from 2008 to 2024 using the proposed quadrupled threshold to “understand what these proposed changes could mean for federal disaster spending and state and local government budgets,” their report states.
President Donald Trump’s administration has repeatedly expressed its aims to cut FEMA spending and shift more post-disaster recovery responsibility to states, though it’s not clear if this higher threshold proposal will be implemented. Members of Congress continue to debate how FEMA should be reformed.
At a House Appropriations Committee hearing on May 7, Hamilton said federal law is clear on the federal government’s role as a resource for overwhelmed states.

“The problem is we’ve created financial incentives for the continuation of that, and even expanded levels,” Hamilton said. “We’ve kind of lowered disaster thresholds. We’ve used other criteria that, to be honest, are a little bit too soft for my opinion, that have incentivized financially a lack of carrying insurance policies, as well as lower disaster thresholds, which are probably not the best use of my staff.” Hamilton said. 
“This isn’t to say that states aren’t in need. We know they are, but we have to raise the threshold so that FEMA can truly prioritize efforts where the state is, in fact, overwhelmed, he said”
Hamilton, who was appointed by Trump, was fired from his interim role one day after the hearing, where he contradicted Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem by telling members of Congress that he believed eliminating FEMA entirely was “not in the best interest of the American people.” 
After a disaster, states assess damage and can request a presidential disaster declaration to open eligibility for aid through FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund. The president has sole discretion over whether to approve a declaration, but FEMA uses internal thresholds to shape their recommendations to the president.
The minimum threshold for public assistance programs — which help state and local governments recoup the costs of debris clearing and infrastructure repairs — sits at a statewide cost-to-population ratio of $1.89 per capita impact (PCI). Quadrupling it would raise it to $7.56 PCI.

The nonprofit research group quadrupled the PCI threshold for each year between 2008 and 2024 and compared the costs from preliminary damage assessment reports for each disaster in that timeframe to determine if it would have met the threshold for federal aid. 
The group found that 71% of major disasters from 2008 to 2024 would not have received a presidential disaster declaration under the higher threshold, meaning states would have lost out on roughly $15 billion in federal assistance.
Tennessee would have lost $468 million of aid if this higher threshold had been in place, the report states.
The Hamilton memo also recommended reducing the federal government’s share of recovery costs when disaster declarations are granted by capping the share at 75%. 
Currently, the federal government covers at least 75% of costs. In Tennessee, the state and local governments typically split the remaining 25% share.
If the 75% cap had been in place from 2008 to 2024, Tennessee would have had to cover an additional $118 million in recovery costs — the most of any state or territory, according to the report.

Motte’s story was the focus of the South Carolina American Revolution Sestercentennial Commission’s inaugural Founding Mothers event. Members of the commission, which goes by SC250 for short, hope to create an annual tradition of recognizing the women who contributed to America’s founding as the country enters its 250th year.
Luther and Doraine Wannamaker, who own the property about 40 miles south of Columbia that once included the Motte home, offered to host the first Founding Mothers event on the anniversary of the day the British surrendered the fort. That just so happened to be the day after Mother’s Day.
Gov. Henry McMaster proclaimed Monday to be Founding Mothers’ Day.
Commissioners are aiming higher: They want state law changed to designate Founding Mothers’ Day as the Monday after Mother’s Day every year.
They have the backing of at least one legislator, Sen. Jeff Zell, a Sumter Republican who said Monday he’d be interested in sponsoring a resolution when legislators return to Columbia next year.
Putting the day in state law would be a permanent recognition of the role women played in the Revolution, a role that often gets overlooked, said retired Gen. Will Grimsley, chairman of the SC250 commission.
“We need to constantly go back and tell everybody’s story,” Grimsley said. “But a really undertold part of the story, quite frankly, are women.”

The Wannamakers have done reenactments of the siege, with men on horses riding from what would have been Fort Motte to the farmhouse where Motte herself had been exiled to tell her their plan of laying siege to her home, said Doraine Wannamaker.
The family hosts private tours of the spot, showing off the stone marker surrounded by dirt where the house once stood. An archaeologist from the University of South Carolina has visited repeatedly to dig up artifacts, including a cannonball and shot used by the British and Patriots.
But Monday was the first official event the Wannamakers have hosted alongside the commission responsible for highlighting South Carolina’s role in the Revolutionary War.
The story of Fort Motte
By the time British troops reached Motte’s home in what is now Calhoun County, on a bluff that overlooks what is now Congaree National Park, she had already been forced out of one home because of the war.
Motte’s original home in Charleston was selected as a headquarters for Loyalist lieutenant colonels and their company of 30 soldiers when British troops captured the coastal city. Motte, widowed not long before, fled inland to the property once owned by her brother, who had died several years earlier, according to the American Battlefield Trust.
Only a couple of months after Motte moved into the house, the British again came for her home. The house, located near the Congaree and Wateree rivers, was an ideal location for supplies coming from Charleston and headed to Camden and Ninety-Six, said Pickett, who has researched women’s contributions to the war effort.

In January 1781, British troops, led by Lt. Donald McPherson, took over the house, called it Fort Motte and surrounded it with fortifications. Motte and her three children fled to a nearby farmhouse on the property, according to the American Battlefield Trust.
Patriots took interest in Fort Motte in May of that year, after taking out several other British posts.
Forcing the British to surrender Motte’s house would take out a crucial supply line for the British.
As the Patriots, led by Brig. Gen. Francis Marion — known as the “Swamp Fox” — began the siege on Fort Motte, McPherson refused to surrender, correctly guessing reinforcements were approaching, Pickett said.
It was then that Motte, approached by either Marion or Lt. Colonel Henry Lee, agreed to let the Patriots burn down her house and destroy the supply depot altogether. According to some historical accounts, Motte gave the Americans combustible arrows to help them.
“Instead of being upset when told, she replied, according to Lee’s memoirs, that she was grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the good of her country, and she would watch the approaching scene with delight,” Pickett said.
After setting fire to the house’s roof, the Patriots fired grapeshot at any British soldiers who tried to put it out. McPherson surrendered, and the Patriots took back the burned Fort Motte. Patriots and British soldiers then dined together in the farmhouse where Motte and her family had been staying, Pickett said.
“Now, the capture of Fort Motte was not a grand, epic battle,” Pickett said. “It was a small, relatively bloodless engagement, but it was a significant victory for the Americans because it changed the momentum of the war in their favor.”
Not much remains of the site of the siege. A large stone that shows where the house once stood reads, “Site of Rebecca Motte’s home, sacrificed for her country, May 12, 1781.” As historians told the story of the battle, flags waved in blustery wind behind them, one British and several representing the Patriots, including the Gadsden flag.

Women during the war
Most women’s contributions to the war were small but meaningful. They managed farms and plantations while their husbands and sons were fighting in the war, sent food and provisions to the army and gathered information to pass along. They took sick and wounded soldiers into their homes and either nursed them back to health or buried them when they died, Pickett said.
“None of these things were very easy for them to do,” Pickett said.
Others had more active roles in thwarting British troops and helping the Patriots claim victory.
Take, for instance, Dorothy Sinkler Richardson, who historians credit with saving Marion’s life in 1780.
When British Col. Banastre Tarleton set up a decoy campsite near Richardson’s plantation meant to lure Marion for an attack, Richardson sent a messenger to warn Marion, according to SC250.
“Thanks to Dorothy Sinkler Richardson, Francis Marion remained at liberty to continue to make life difficult for the British,” Pickett said.
Jane Thomas, who lived in what is now Spartanburg, similarly foiled a plot to surprise American troops after overhearing two women talking about a plot to surprise Patriot soldiers near Thomas’ house. Thomas, who was 60 miles from home, rode back straight away to warn the men, allowing them to instead surprise the British troops, Pickett said.

Emily Geiger, at 18 years old, volunteered to deliver a message to Gen. Thomas Sumter (“The Gamecock”) to meet Maj. Gen. Nathanael Greene, believing a young woman would be able to get through enemy lines where a man would not. She was successful and helped join the two battalions, Pickett said.
In coming years, the commission plans to host similar events in other parts of the state, highlighting the stories of different women, said Molly Fortune, executive director of SC250.
Telling these stories is a major step forward, but there’s more work to be done, Pickett said.
Designating a day to remember the ways in which women contributed to the country’s foundation is a way of ensuring their stories remain in the public eye instead of being lost to history, she said.
“We are just beginning to explore the activities performed by Native American women and women of African descent,” Pickett said. “We need to do the research to bring their stories to light, because the more stories we bring to light, the more attention we bring to the important role that South Carolina played in winning our independence.”

Shielding kids from so-called “sexually explicit” materials. Ensuring our children’s education is aligned with values that uphold morality. Permitting chaplains to fill the gaps for mental health support at our public schools. 
Let’s think about the children, they said. Let’s protect the children! 
But good intentions don’t always equate to good legislation, as we saw during the 2025 legislative session with bill after bill that pushed ideological principles, imposed Christian doctrines and would have done little more than chip away at our First Amendment rights. 
Since the First Amendment was ratified in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights, these 45 words have been integral to democracy. It protects our fundamental rights to free expression and speech, to practice religion or no religion at all, and to protest our government, among other rights.
Upholding these rights is the sworn responsibility of our elected leaders. But the culture warriors among our state legislative assembly seemed wholly unconcerned. And that’s extremely alarming!
Take Senate Bill 2307, for example. Legislators narrowly passed this bill that sparked contentious debate in committee hearings and on the legislative floor, with much of the discussion focused on fears that children might discover library books featuring teenagers in same-sex relationships or depicting families with two dads or two moms. 
If community members don’t want to engage with certain ideas or topics – or let their kids engage with certain ideas or topics – they don’t have to. Substituting state control for parental judgement is not the answer. In fact, that’s censorship. And once you allow the government to censor someone else, you’re also giving the government the power to censor you or something you like later. 
Similarly, religious freedom was up for debate this year, too. 
Not long ago, religious freedom was largely viewed across the ideological and political spectrum as a bedrock value of American democracy that transcended partisan agendas. Every individual and family — not politicians or the government — get to decide for themselves what religious beliefs, if any, they adopt and practice. But in statehouses across the county, religious freedom debates are now at the epicenter of the culture wars as some believe certain Christian ideals should be reflected in political decisions. 
North Dakota lawmakers attempted to require public schools to post prescribed copies of the Ten Commandments in public school and university classrooms and other school spaces with House Bill 1145 and they wanted to encourage local school districts to allow taxpayer-funded chaplains in our public schools with House Bill 1456.
As enshrined in the First Amendment, however, religious freedom includes two complementary protections: the right to religious belief and expression and a guarantee that the government neither prefers religion over non-religion nor favors particular faiths over others. These dual protections are supposed to work hand in hand, allowing religious liberty to thrive and safeguarding both religion and government from the influences of the other.
The ACLU’s opposition to these bills doesn’t mean we don’t believe protecting children or ensuring their education is guided by strong moral values isn’t important. It’s just that parents already have the right and ability to do so. And what’s right for one family may not be right for another. That’s not up for someone else to decide. 
Fortunately, Gov. Kelly Armstrong vetoed Senate Bill 2307, and an attempt to override the veto failed. House Bills 1145 and 1456 failed, too. Protecting our First Amendment rights like this is essential for a vibrant and open society where individuals can express themselves freely, hold the government accountable and participate in the democratic process. 
But just because the 2025 legislative session is over doesn’t mean the fight for our First Amendment rights in North Dakota is over. Far from it. The state legislature isn’t the only place these debates are happening. We’re seeing similar efforts at local community library boards, school boards and city councils across the state, too. You can bet the culture warriors among our legislative body will try again during the 2027 session, too. 
We know that attacks on our First Amendment rights won’t stop – and the American Civil Liberties Union of North Dakota is prepared to continue the fight.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-925364372-1024x6841741732180-1.jpg,,,2025-05-14 07:04:47.478702

Natural gas customers in the Chicago suburbs and downstate Illinois are likely to see an increase in their monthly bills next year, but it's up to state regulators to decide how big a hike, if any, to approve.

Nicor Gas, which serves 2.3 million customers in northern and western Illinois, requested the largest gas rate plan in state history — roughly equivalent to $7.50 per month for the average residential customer. Ameren Illinois, which has about 800,000 downstate customers, requested an increase that translates to between $8 to $10 higher monthly bills for a typical residential customer.

Regulators at the Illinois Commerce Commission are expected to announce a decision as to whether to approve or alter the hikes in November. The new rates would go into effect at the start of 2026.

In the meantime, consumer watchdogs and environmental advocates are railing against both utilities for their requests, which they argue should be slashed drastically.

Critiques from consumer groups

The Citizens Utility Board, a consumer watchdog group, filed written testimony this month in both cases arguing that the requests should be cut — Nicor's by about 36% and Ameren's by about 42%. Other groups, like the Illinois attorney general’s office, the Environmental Defense Fund and others argued for additional cuts in their own filings.

Abe Scarr, director of the consumer advocacy group Illinois PIRG, said the companies are requesting “long-term commitments” in paying for gas system infrastructure, despite the potential for decreasing demand for fossil fuels.

“The more expensive their infrastructure investments, the more opportunity they have to profit,” Scarr said.

Because utility profits are regulated by agencies like the ICC, there is a financial incentive to invest in infrastructure so that more funds can be “recovered” from customers — a portion of which then go to shareholders.

That rate of return is one of the things being litigated in these rate cases. Both companies requested a bump in their allowed “return on equity,” which translates to the amount paid to shareholders. In recent years, the ICC has consistently rejected utilities’ requests for higher return rates, although they have approved some modest increases.

“You’re asking us to predict what those shares are worth next year? Next month is gonna be hard,” CUB’s general counsel Eric DeBellis said.

DeBellis said the companies overstepped in other areas of their requests as well, including costs associated with rate cases and post-employment benefits as well as an accounting irregularity worth millions of dollars that Ameren has already admitted was erroneous.

He noted that Nicor included tens of millions of dollars of projects that were rejected by the ICC in the company’s rate request two years ago, a move that DeBellis called “galling.”

Environmentalists question future of gas

The companies drew criticism from some environmentalists, who argued in testimony this month that investing in natural gas infrastructure as the state — and country — move away from fossil fuels could leave customers on the hook for the bill for decades.

Curt Stokes, a senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund, said he's concerned that gas companies are building out new gas infrastructure in a way that “locks us in and keeps us hooked on fossil fuels for our energy needs.”

For Ameren, much of the contention comes from the company’s plan to upgrade its natural gas system, a plan that company officials say is required by federal safety rules. But critics point out that Ameren frequently chooses to totally replace pipes — the most expensive and most profitable option — instead of cheaper alternatives like testing them for safety.

But Ameren officials defend the choice as being the only option to ensure compliance with federal rules.

“The investments we have proposed in our reliability plan will enable us to meet strict federal pipeline safety requirements, reduce leaks, and provide reliable and affordable natural gas service for our residential and business customers,” Brad Kloeppel, Ameren’s senior director of gas operations, said in a statement. “We evaluate all methods available for each segment of pipe subject to compliance based on cost and operational feasibility.""

Meanwhile, advocates have criticized Nicor’s efforts at lessening greenhouse gas emissions.

The utility requested to make permanent a pilot program called “TotalGreen,” a voluntary effort that allows customers to pay to offset their carbon footprint through a mix of “renewable natural gas” and investments in methane capture and forest conservation.

“They certainly have not demonstrated, and there’s lots of — lots of — reasons to be skeptical, that there’s any environmental benefit,” Scarr said.

The EDF, Illinois PIRG and the Environmental Law and Policy Center argued in a joint filing that the “TotalGreen” program fails to live up to the state’s clean energy goals.

Among other reasons, the groups’ testimony said it costs more than $2,400 per person and has only offset the equivalent of 0.0031% of the company’s yearly carbon footprint.

Jennifer Golz, a Nicor spokesperson, said the program “supports the state’s broader environmental objectives on the path to a sustainable future.”

“Nicor Gas supports our parent company, Southern Company Gas, in its goal to achieve net zero direct greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by 2050,” Golz said in an email. “We also support reducing emissions across the natural gas value chain, from gas production to transmission to end uses.”

TotalGreen is one of several projects outlined in the two rate cases which use “renewable natural gas,” a term for methane that is captured from landfills, wastewater treatment plants and farms that would have otherwise been released into the atmosphere.

Stokes said there were “too many open questions” about renewable natural gas programs for the EDF to support the initiatives, but he was optimistic about some of the companies’ other proposals.

“There are good signs in these cases that Nicor and Ameren are looking to be more innovative,” Stokes said.

He pointed specifically to Nicor’s energy efficiency programs and a proposal for a pilot program at Ameren which would allow communities to transition from natural gas to electric all at once as pipes need to be replaced or retired.

Jared Polis signed the Colorado Voting Rights Act, a measure Gonzales sponsored, into law Monday, May 12, 2025 at the Governor’s Residence in Denver. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado legislators this year passed a handful of bills related to elections and democracy.
One of the bills put existing federal rights into state law in case national protections erode. Another changed how the state fills vacant General Assembly seats, which became a hot topic after three senators resigned in the period after last November’s election and the start of the legislative session.
The session, during which Democrats held large majorities in both the House of Representatives and Senate, ended last week. Here is a look at some of the key elections and democracy proposals lawmakers adopted.
The right to vote
Gov. Jared Polis signed the Colorado Voting Rights Act, Senate Bill 25-1, into law earlier this week. The law codifies parts of the 1965 national voting rights law into state statute in case federal protections are stripped, either at the hands of the Trump administration or through the courts.
The law clarifies the right to vote across racial and language minority groups and adds ballot translation requirements to municipal elections. A handful of cities in the state opposed the bill because of increased workload and cost. The law also bans voting qualifications based on sexual orientation, gender expression or whether a voter is in jail.
It also creates a civil right for voters to bring discrimination lawsuits against local governments for alleged voter suppression.
“Colorado’s election system is one of the very best in the country, and with this, we’re taking steps to make sure that no matter what happens at the federal level, we can make sure to protect our voter integrity here in the great state of Colorado,” Polis said before signing the bill into law.
The bill passed with entirely Democratic support.
Gun ban
Polis signed House Bill 25-1225 the same day as the Colorado Voting Rights Act. The law prohibits someone from carrying a visible gun or toy gun while doing certain election-related activities such as voting, canvassing, counting votes and helping someone else vote. Carrying a visible gun during those activities will be classified as voter intimidation.
“Those who serve as on a canvas board or serve as election judges — these are salt-of-the-Earth, dedicated positions. They require an incredible amount of time,” bill sponsor Sen. Nick Hinrichsen, a Pueblo Democrat, said ahead of the bill’s signing. “When they come under threat for the work they do to preserve the freedom of our communities, our state and our country, we need to ensure that they have protections on the back end. That’s what this bill does.”
Lawmaker vacancy process
A bipartisan bill changed how vacancies in the General Assembly are filled when a lawmaker resigns or dies before the end of their term. There were five vacancy selections this year. They concerned three Senate seats, a House seat when a representative moved to one of the vacant Senate seats, and another Senate seat when a lawmaker resigned amid an ethics investigation.
Right now, a vacancy committee comprising members of the outgoing lawmaker’s party, often highly-involved party insiders, picks a replacement to serve until the next general election. That could create a scenario where a handful of people pick a legislator to serve the entirety of a term if a lawmaker resigns shortly after reelection.










This bill makes sure that somebody will represent the people of a district, but as soon as they have the opportunity to stand (for an election), then people can run against them. That's fair.


– Gov. Jared Polis


The new process creates a new vacancy election to coincide with an already-scheduled election. Vacancy committees would still immediately fill the seat, but the appointed lawmaker would then need to run to retain their seat, either that same year or the next one, depending on when the resignation happened.
The idea is that an appointed lawmaker could serve in just one session before running for reelection.
The law also increases the number of people who serve on a vacancy committee by including more precinct organizers and county commissioners of the same party that live in the district.
“This bill makes sure that somebody will represent the people of a district, but as soon as they have the opportunity to stand (for an election), then people can run against them. That’s fair. I think it strikes a good balance, and it will make sure that we have more accountability to the people of our great state,” Polis said before signing the bill on May 12.
Ballot initiative standards
House Bill 25-1327 would make changes to the citizen initiative process, in which people can bring measures to the ballot if they gather enough signatures.
“With more and more ballot initiatives being brought, we are trying to make the process easier for people to track and follow, and we are also trying to reduce some inefficiencies for agencies that are part of the title review process,” bill sponsor Sen. Cathy Kipp, a Fort Collins Democrat, said during the bill’s Senate committee hearing.
If initiative proponents bring five or more drafts in the same cycle on the same topic, they would need to submit a chart explaining the differences between the drafts so the state’s Title Board and other interested parties can understand the distinctions between the versions.
Proponents for initiatives who earn a title, which allows them to collect signatures, would need to update the secretary of state when they reach 25%, 50% and 75% of their required petition signatures, and those statuses would also get posted online.
Fiscal summaries for initiatives that propose a tax increase would need to include an estimate of the maximum revenue change.
Additionally, the Title Board would be required to indicate whether an initiative would modify, extend or repeal existing law or create new law.
There are also some calendar and deadline changes for the Title Board in the bill.
The bill passed on party-line votes in both chambers, with Democrats in favor. Polis has not yet taken action on it.

House Bill 436, sponsored by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, cleared the Senate Committee on Judiciary A in a 4-3 vote along party lines Tuesday with Republicans prevailing. The measure heads to the floor for final passage. 
“I can’t wait to read the bad press,” committee chairman Sen. Greg Miller, R-Norco, said shortly after the committee adjourned.
Firment’s bill would prohibit “unauthorized aliens” — defined in the measure as individuals illegally in the United States under federal immigration law — from receiving insurance payouts for general damages in auto accidents. General damages include compensation for pain and suffering. The proposal would still allow recovery for “special damages,” such as medical expenses and property damage.
Firment said the purpose of his bill is to help address the state’s auto insurance crisis while discouraging undocumented immigration. 
Sen. Sam Jenkins, D-Shreveport, said Firment’s bill would create a “double standard” by allowing insurance companies to profit off migrants without legal status while not facing much risk. Insurers would still be able to sell coverage to noncitizens but would not have to cover their damages in certain situations, he said.
Louisiana auto insurance proposals include limits on ‘unauthorized alien’ lawsuits

Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, argued that same point.
“Insurance companies do sell insurance to illegal aliens,” Luneau said. “… As long as they have a passport, they will sell them insurance, including uninsured motorist [coverage]. So under your bill, they would not be able to collect for the bodily injury portion of that claim, so they’re buying an insurance policy that they can’t collect on.”
Firment said his bill would not stop insurers from voluntarily paying or settling a bodily injury claim for an undocumented immigrant. 
He also mentioned a commercial trucking company owner who recently laid off five drivers due to the high cost of auto insurance in Louisiana.  
“If there’s anything I can do to help those folks, that’s what I’m here for,” Firment said.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A $6.96 million settlement — the second largest in Milwaukee’s history — stems from a federal civil lawsuit which accused Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) detectives of fabricating evidence against Danny Wilber, framing him for a 2004 homicide. Wilber spent 18 years in prison for a crime he always asserted he didn’t commit. 
Wilber’s homicide conviction was ultimately overturned after he was found to have had an unfair trial in a federal appeals court. On May 8, the city’s Judiciary and Legislation Committee recommended approving the settlement. Yet before it was approved, elected leaders expressed discontent that taxpayers in Milwaukee would be footing the bill. 
Further approvals will be needed from the Common Council and Mayor Cavalier Johnson. In a statement, Wilber said that the settlement “clearly establishes what I have truthfully maintained at all times — that I was completely innocent and that it was physically impossible that I committed this murder.” 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Ald. Mark Chambers Jr. called the judge in Wilber’s case “incompetent”, while Ald. Robert Bauman said the judge made “some pretty bad decisions,” the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Council President Jose Perez said the city was “paying the price for some bad judgement and it’s inexcusable.” Yet it was city of Milwaukee police detectives, not a judge, who manipulated evidence in the case, and laid the groundwork for the settlement nearly 20 years after they arrested Wilber. 
In January 2004, Wilber was at an after-hours party when, according to a federal complaint, he got into an argument with another party guest. As more people got involved the argument became a physical altercation which was being watched by another guest, David Diaz. At some point during the fight, someone standing behind Diaz shot him in the back of the head at close range. Diaz died instantly, and everyone who’d been in the kitchen panicked and left. 
The complaint states that physical evidence from the scene showed that Diaz had been shot from behind. One of the named defendants in the civil action, Milwaukee police detective Thomas Casper, collected measurements from the scene and recovered bullet fragments that showed that Diaz had been shot from behind. Diaz’s autopsy corroborated those findings. “It was and is undisputed that, at the time of the shooting, Plaintiff Wilber was inside the kitchen and in front of David Diaz,” the complaint reads. 
Despite the ballistic evidence, MPD detectives honed in on Diaz as the main murder suspect. Detectives didn’t look into multiple other plausible suspects, and went as far as to fabricate witness statements, the complaint states. Two other detectives, Randolph Olson and Louis Johnson, interrogated a witness to the shooting, Richard Torres, who was wanted for probation violations and turned himself in for questioning. Olson and Johnson used “threats and intimidation” to compel Torres to give a false statement by threatening to charge him with murder, and making clear that they were interested in Wilber as the shooter. Around the same time, another detective, Gregory Schuler, interrogated another witness, Jeranek Diaz. The complaint accuses Schuler of fabricating “substantial parts of a statement” from Diaz, including that at the time of the shooting, David Diaz had just turned around and was about to leave the kitchen when he was shot. Jeranek Diaz never said those statements, and was not allowed to review the typewritten version of his statement. Notes that Schuler allegedly took during the interview were never presented either to the prosecution or to Wilber’s attorneys. 
Other detectives interviewed witnesses who had a learning disability and said after the shooting that she saw her brother pat himself down to check if he’d been shot. The detectives, Timothy Duffy and Joseph Erwin, wrote that the witness ducked her head and when she looked back up, everyone was running out the door and she hadn’t seen her brother. Duffy and Erwin did not read the witness’s statement back to her, and she signed the statement without knowing what it said. 
One witness who was detained overnight without food, water or access to showers was told after interviews by detectives that he was “not telling us what we need to hear”, before being returned to a cell. Eventually, the exhausted witnesses agreed to make false statements if he was allowed to go home. Detectives also manipulated scene diagrams, and Wilber was charged with first-degree intentional homicide with a dangerous weapon in February 2004. Prosecutors heavily relied on evidence compiled by detectives, as well as false witness statements.

Wilber spent 18 years in prison, with the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office formally dismissing his case in May 2022. In order to carry out what the complaint describes as a “conspiracy,” the detectives would have needed to act alongside other MPD investigative, supervisory and command personnel, as well as “other unknown co-conspirators.” Casper would eventually go on to become one of the first commanders for the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team (MAIT), a network of detectives that focuses on civilian deaths by police, and which has been criticized for conducting problematic death reviews. MAIT selected a different commander in 2020, and Casper died by the time Wilber’s lawsuit reached its conclusion.
“The evidence that came out in this case showed that this was not a series of mistakes by a squad of incompetent detectives,” Wilber said in a statement. “No, it was a conscious plan to construct a false case against me with manufactured witness statements in order to put me behind bars. It was a plan that they have used again and again against Black, Indigenous and other poor people of color. In this case, like in many others, the prosecutors and the Court system were, from beginning to end, vindictively complicit in my wrongful conviction and incarceration. This settlement delivers a measure of justice against the police who framed me, but what about the prosecutor who presented the false evidence at trial? What about the Judge who allowed it and violated my constitutional rights? What about the Assistant Attorney General who fought for years to keep me in a cage after my conviction was overturned and took the case all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States? They’re all complicit and because of the corrupt system, they get to walk away, free to repeat the egregious misconduct under the guise of due processes.”
Attorneys Ben Elson and Flint Taylor of the People’s Law Office in Chicago, who represented Wilber, said that the city would be paying him nearly $7 million because its detectives framed an innocent man. The attorneys addressed statements made by local elected officials, who were quick to blame the judge and other non-city government figures in the case. “Instead of passing the blame onto others, the City should publicly acknowledge its role in Danny Wilber’s wrongful conviction and make a sincere apology.”

Tennessee Lookout)I’m a Tennessean, a mother of three, and someone who lives with a complex, disabling pain condition. 
I’m also the CEO of a national nonprofit dedicated to improving the lives of the more than 51.6 million Americans who live with chronic pain. And right now, I’m deeply alarmed by Tennessee legislation that could strip away access to the thing that helps me — and thousands of others — get through the day: safe, full-spectrum CBD.
House Bill 1376 and Senate Bill 1413 would limit even trace amounts of Delta-9 THC in hemp-derived products — effectively banning many full-spectrum CBD products that are non-intoxicating, carefully formulated, and third-party tested. While I support common-sense regulation to eliminate unsafe synthetic intoxicants and unregulated products from the market, this bill goes too far. Rather than protecting consumers, it threatens to harm more than 665,000 Tennesseans who rely on full-spectrum hemp CBD for relief.
For people living with chronic pain, full-spectrum CBD is not a luxury — it’s a lifeline. I’ve lived with pain for over 30 years due to a rare, chronic pain condition that causes widespread, burning nerve pain. The simplest tasks — standing, lifting my child, working a full day — can be nearly impossible without some form of relief. I’ve tried dozens of treatments, from prescription medications to physical therapy to surgical interventions. Some helped. Many didn’t. Full-spectrum CBD is one of the few things that consistently makes a difference. It reduces inflammation, soothes muscle spasms, and takes the edge off my daily suffering.
Every day, I use three specific full-spectrum products — a tincture, a topical, and an edible. They contain trace amounts of naturally occurring Delta-9 THC, well within the federal legal limit of 0.3%. These products don’t get me high. They help me sleep. They help me show up for my job and be present for my family. They allow me to contribute to my community and care for my kids. Without them, I don’t know how I would manage.
Hemp bill conflict could fire up House, Senate finance committees

And I am not alone.
At the U.S. Pain Foundation, we regularly hear from individuals who face serious challenges in accessing the care and relief they need to manage chronic pain. Barriers like stigma, high costs, limited treatment options and restrictive policies often stand in the way. For some, hemp-derived CBD has become an essential part of their pain management plan, helping them live with greater dignity and less suffering. In fact, a national survey we conducted in 2022 found that 22% of respondents currently use hemp-derived CBD products — often alongside other therapies as part of a multidisciplinary approach to care. These individuals deserve access to the treatments that help them, free from unnecessary barriers.
Science is catching up, too. Studies show CBD as a promising option for managing chronic pain, particularly neuropathic and inflammatory pain, due to its comprehensive therapeutic approach. Unlike isolated cannabinoids, full-spectrum CBD includes all naturally occurring compounds from the cannabis plant — such as a range of cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids — which work together to produce what’s known as the ‘entourage effect.’ 
Recent research explores the potential benefits of various cannabinoids in pain management and emphasizes the role of synergistic interactions and the entourage effect, highlighting the importance of full-spectrum products in achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes.
And yet, despite this growing body of evidence, Tennessee lawmakers are poised to remove this option from people who need it most. HB 1376/SB 1413 fails to distinguish between therapeutic, non-intoxicating full-spectrum products and the synthetic or recreational products that rightly raise concern. In doing so, it threatens the health, independence, and stability of thousands of Tennesseans living with pain.
I was heartbroken to see the legislature pass this bill. But I still hold out hope — hope that rests now with Gov. Bill Lee. I’ve written to him personally, urging a veto. I ask my fellow Tennesseans — especially those who’ve never had to think twice about how they manage their pain—to consider what’s at stake.
This isn’t about special treatment or backdoor legalization. It’s about the right to access safe, plant-based wellness tools. It’s about evidence-based public policy that doesn’t punish people for trying to survive their conditions. It’s about understanding that one-size-fits-all health care solutions often leave the most vulnerable behind.
We are your neighbors, coworkers, veterans, and grandparents. We are Tennesseans who want to live productive lives despite our pain. Please don’t take away one of the few tools that helps us do that.
I hope Gov. Lee will veto HB 1376/SB 1413 and protect access to full-spectrum CBD. Preserve the dignity, autonomy, and well-being of people living with pain in Tennessee.

I was 43 when I received the simultaneously wonderful and intimidating news that I would be the mother of twins. Later, when it was confirmed that both boys would be born with Down syndrome, fear took the front seat. I had no idea how I would provide care for two children with disabilities. I had so many questions.
To my relief, I soon discovered that Idaho had several programs in place to support our family. First, there was the Katie Beckett waiver which gave our sons access to Medicaid coverage and spared us from what would have been crushing NICU bills.
Over the years, Medicaid has been the backbone of their health care — funding multiple surgeries, specialist appointments, and ongoing speech, occupational, and physical therapies. We’ve also benefited from waivers that help with alternative therapies, community support, personal care services, respite care and other services that have allowed our boys to be active participants in our community.
Children’s health services could see trims even under scaled-back Medicaid cuts

These supports haven’t just met our needs — they’ve helped shape our sons’ lives. They’ve made it possible for them to grow up healthy, engaged, and included.
I’ve spent years volunteering with the Treasure Valley Down Syndrome Association, where I’ve walked alongside many new parents as they try to make sense of this complex system. I have always been proud that Idaho is a state that invests in the unique and individualized needs of children with disabilities.
That’s why what’s happening now in Congress is so concerning.
Today, I’m scared — not for a diagnosis or a milestone, but because the services that have kept my children thriving for the past nine years are at risk. Medicaid and its optional programs — including the Katie Beckett waiver — are vulnerable to cuts, and proposed changes at the federal level threaten the very foundation of support many families depend on.
It’s important to understand how this system works. Medicaid currently allows states to partner with the federal government, funding essential services for individuals with disabilities. In Idaho, the federal government provides 70 cents of every dollar the state spends on Medicaid services to individuals with disabilities. This partnership helps provide life-changing support, but proposed cuts threaten this vital funding. If that funding is slashed or capped, families may be forced to go without the services their children need.
Medicaid isn’t just about health care — it also supports children with disabilities in public schools. My sons’ paraprofessionals, aides, special education teachers, adaptive equipment and educational aids are all made possible through Medicaid funding. If these resources disappear, schools will be left scrambling to meet the needs of some of their most vulnerable students — and many of Idaho’s schools, especially our rural schools won’t be able to.
And the need for services is only growing. The average life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has risen dramatically over the past few decades, now reaching into their 60s. With longer lives comes a greater need for long-term support — support that allows individuals to live in the community, hold jobs, maintain relationships, and enjoy lives of dignity, meaning and personal contributions.
My husband and I recently visited the site of the former Willowbrook State School in New York — a haunting reminder of what can happen when families don’t have the support they need. Willowbrook was an institution where people with developmental disabilities were warehoused, neglected, and abused. The facility closed in 1987, and today, the site is home to a college that promotes inclusion for individuals with disabilities and trains professionals in disability services. It’s a powerful symbol of change — and a warning.
We cannot forget the lessons of the past. When families are left without options, systems break down. Crisis care becomes the default. People are pushed to the margins. And the most vulnerable pay the highest price.
Our country has an opportunity to stay the course — to keep investing in programs that work, that save lives, and that allow families to stay together. But that will only happen if our leaders choose to protect and prioritize Medicaid.
To our elected officials in Washington: I urge you — do not turn your backs on families like mine. Preserve Medicaid and the absolutely vital services it provides. Maintain the many programs that give individuals with disabilities the chance to live full and meaningful lives.
Our country has an opportunity to stay the course — to keep investing in programs that work, that save lives, and that allow families to stay together. The decisions made in Washington will determine whether individuals with disabilities continue to receive the care they need and deserve. Medicaid has long been a cornerstone or that support. It is critical that our representatives understand just how much is at stake — for families, for communities, and for the future we are building together.

Chances are state lawmakers or religious zealots did not escort you inside, and you didn’t have to wonder whose stories were hidden behind locked doors or inside a vault because nothing was locked up.
By “whose stories,” I refer to those books that reflect the lives of readers who may not often be depicted in literature, much less in a positive manner. So, a Black child who can’t read about racial prejudice in Maya Angelou’s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings might blame himself for his own race-based struggles in a white-dominated society. The child who was molested might blame himself until he reads another book often targeted by censors, Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye. Or teenagers questioning their own sexual identity might fear they’re the only ones with such a quandary until they read Maia Kobabe’s Gender Queer. Kobabe’s book was one of numerous books targeted by former state senator Jason Rapert of Conway during his tumultuous time on the Arkansas State Library Board.
Recently, the Arkansas Legislature chose to abolish that board, which wasn’t as censorship-prone as many lawmakers apparently wanted, and to have the governor appoint a new panel. As if that weren’t bad enough, the legislature later approved a bill requiring librarians in schools with kindergarten through fifth-grade students to “store non-age-appropriate sexual content … in a locked compartment within a designated area.” The bill defines “non-age-appropriate sexual content” as “any materials that include explicit instruction, promotion, or advocacy of sexual ideology, behaviors, or orientations that are not developmentally appropriate for kindergarten through grade five … students.” 
The law does not specify who decides what is age-appropriate.










Arkansas’ escalating campaign of censorship represents yet another vague, punitive, and politically motivated attempt to chill free expression and intimidate public servants.


– Megan Bailey, communications director, ACLU of Arkansas, referring to Act 917 of 2025


This escalation in the war against libraries and public school teachers came after a federal judge in December struck down challenged provisions of Act 372 of 2023 which sought to criminalize librarians who provided minors with access to inappropriate books. 
Part of Act 372 that went unchallenged in court and that became law “already requires school libraries to place books deemed to be inappropriate in an area inaccessible to students under 18,” said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom.
So, why was the lock-’em-up measure, Act 917 of 2025, even needed? Perhaps, for show, for politicians to look tough when it comes to already-denigrated librarians and teachers.
I asked Megan Bailey, communications director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, about the possibility of the ACLU’s suing over Act 917.
“We are currently reviewing all options and are continuing to monitor how this and related laws are enforced,” Bailey replied.
Referring to “Arkansas’ escalating campaign of censorship,” Bailey said Act 917 “represents yet another vague, punitive, and politically motivated attempt to chill free expression and intimidate public servants.”
“While it may appear narrower than Act 372 on its face, the lack of clarity around what constitutes ‘developmentally appropriate’ content — and the threat of civil lawsuits against libraries and librarians — creates a chilling effect that will likely lead to over-removal of lawful, constitutionally protected materials out of fear of retribution,” Bailey said in an email.
Caldwell-Stone said in an email that, nationally, Act 917 “is unique in that it requires books that are deemed to include ‘advocacy of sexual ideology, behaviors, or orientations’ not developmentally appropriate for K-5 students to be kept under lock and key, requires parental permission to access such books, and includes provisions for punishing schools and educators who do not comply.”
“In targeting books that address or include themes about gender and sexual orientation, the law may be engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment. Additionally, the parental permission requirement could also be found unconstitutional and a violation of students’ rights to access books in the school library,” Caldwell-Stone said.
She noted that in 2003, a federal court ruled against the Cedarville, Arkansas, School Board when the court “set aside a school board’s requirement that students submit a written parental permission slip to access the Harry Potter series.”
“It held having to obtain parental permission to check out the books from the school library constituted a restriction on access that violated the students’ First Amendment rights, given that the books had been restricted because school board members ‘dislike[d] the ideas contained in those books,’” Caldwell-Stone said.
“Laws that impose ambiguous standards and threaten punishment for subjective violations raise serious First Amendment concerns. Librarians should not have to face punishment for failing to implement vague, content-based restrictions,” she added. 
Despite court rulings and astute cautions, books and intellectual freedom have long been targets of the morality police, though I can’t remember a time when the far right targeted libraries in Arkansas as much as it has recently.
Censorship was, of course, a hallmark of the late 1940s-50s McCarthy era, and I trust — no, I only hope — that few politicians today yearn to be identified with an era that blacklisted artists and censored books. (Case in point: Ray Bradbury’s dystopian 1953 novel Fahrenheit 451, in which firefighters burn down any houses that contain outlawed books, was published  “for many years” only in a censored version, according to PEN America, a free-expression advocacy nonprofit.)
Lest you think the ACLU, the ALA and I are overreacting, note that in 1965 the novel Black Beauty was banned in South Africa during that country’s apartheid era because of the word “Black” in the title, according to PEN America.
In the United States, the first book in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series became the most often challenged book in libraries from 2000-2009, according to the American Library Association. And the U.S. Naval Academy, responding to President Donald Trump’s anti-diversity orders, removed nearly 400 volumes from its library this year. 
Where does the censorship stop? Should the Bible be banned because it features stories of polygamy, incest and horrific death? I say no. But if the censors are consistent, they will say yes.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-05-14 06:00:52.660627

Local sheriffs are on the front lines in deciding whether to participate in the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. But states increasingly are making the choice for them.
More and more, sheriffs’ hands are tied no matter whether they do — or don’t — want to help with deportations, though they often get the blame when conservatives draw up lists of sanctuary cities.
“‘Naughty lists,’ as we call them, are not super helpful here,” said Patrick Royal, a spokesperson for the National Sheriffs’ Association. “We all know there are places like Colorado where you can’t [help with deportations], and places like North Carolina where you have to.”
Cooperation between sheriffs and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lies at the heart of the Trump administration’s immigration detention policy. The administration plans to punish noncooperative jurisdictions with funding cuts — though many legal experts agree that cooperation is voluntary unless state or local laws say otherwise.
Sheriffs, who typically run local jails, must decide what to do when faced with immigration detainers — requests from ICE to hold onto incarcerated people up to two extra days so ICE officers can show up and arrest them. ICE issues those detainers when the agency reviews fingerprints sent electronically for background checks as part of the jail booking process.
Otherwise, arrested suspects who post bond or are otherwise released by a judge might go free despite their immigration status, prompting ICE in some cases to pursue them in the community.
In North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden ran on a platform of limiting cooperation with ICE  when he was elected in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, in 2018. But today, McFadden must comply with detainers because of a state law passed last year.
In a now-retracted Facebook post, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in late April accused Mecklenburg and several other North Carolina counties of “shielding criminal illegal immigrants” as sanctuary jurisdictions. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said in the post he was writing federal legislation to prosecute sanctuary jurisdictions.
“You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both,” McFadden said. He added that he’d like more choice about whether to comply with detainers. A federal funding cutoff would endanger important jail programs such as rape counseling, he said.
“Everybody’s focused on immigration like that’s the biggest fire, and nobody wants to address the other things. The losers will be the prisoners who need all these services we provide,” McFadden said.










You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both.

Conservative sheriffs in Democratic-controlled states also can be frustrated by state policy on detainers. Sheriff Lew Evangelidis of Worcester County, Massachusetts, said he’s been criticized for releasing prisoners wanted by ICE but sometimes has no choice: A 2017 state Supreme Court ruling prohibits holding prisoners based on detainers.
“If they [ICE] want this person and consider them a threat to public safety, then I want that person out of my community. I want to keep my community safe,” said Evangelidis. He supported a Republican-sponsored effort in the state legislature to allow 12-hour holds for ICE if a judge determines the prisoner is a threat to public safety, but the amendment was voted down in April.
States act on detainers
Many experts agree that ICE detainers can be legally ignored if states allow sheriffs to do that.
“That detainer request is just that, a request, it’s not a requirement,” said Cassandra Charles, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is opposing Louisiana’s lawsuit to reverse a court-ordered ban on cooperation between Orleans Parish and ICE.
The general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, Eddie Caldwell, agreed that the detainers are voluntary under federal law.
The association supports a state bill now under consideration that would require not only the 48-hour detention but also a notice sent 48 hours before release to let ICE know the clock is running. The proposal has passed the House.
The notification matters, Caldwell said, because there can be criminal proceedings that take weeks or months, so ICE in many cases doesn’t realize the 48-hour window has started.
Tillis’ office said the senator’s disagreement with McFadden, a Democrat, and other sheriffs is about that notification.
“It’s not necessarily that [sheriffs] are breaking the law, but rather making it as difficult as possible for ICE to take prisoners into custody by refusing to do some basic things. Notification is important,” said Daniel Keylin, a senior adviser to Tillis.
States including California, Colorado and Massachusetts ban compliance with the ICE detainers, on the general principle that it’s not enough reason to hold people in jails when they’re otherwise free to go because of bail or an end to their criminal cases. Those three states have made recent moves to defend or fine-tune their rules.
California’s attorney general also has issued guidance to local jurisdictions based on a 2017 state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities. That law withstood a court challenge under the first Trump administration.
Colorado has a law against holding prisoners more than six hours longer than required, and a new bill sent to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week would specify that even those six hours can’t be for the purpose of an immigration detainer.
Iowa, Tennessee and Texas are among the states requiring cooperation with detainers.
And Florida has gone further, requiring sheriffs to actively help ICE write detainers though official agreements in which local agencies sign up to help enforce immigration laws.
Cooperation boosts arrests
Such cooperation makes a big difference, experts say — jails are the easiest place to pick up immigrants for deportation, and when local sheriffs and police help out, there are more arrests.
“A larger share of ICE arrests and deportations are happening in places where local law enforcement is cooperative with ICE,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director for the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program, speaking at a recent webinar.
“A declining share of arrests and deportations are happening from places like California, where there are really strict limitations on local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE,” she added.
ICE is making about 600 immigration arrests daily, twice the rate as during the last year of the Biden administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking at the same event.
Reports on deportations are incomplete, Chishti said, but he estimated the current administration is on track to deport half a million people this year and is trying to get that number higher.
“The Trump administration has not been able to change the laws that are on the books, because only Congress can do that,” Chishti said. “It’s going to take congressional action for the Trump administration to achieve its aim of higher [arrest and deportation] numbers.”
President Donald Trump has added more pressure, last month requesting a list from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of sanctuary cities, which he says would face funding cuts. The administration also has sued some states, including Colorado, Illinois and New York, over their policies.
Asked for comment on the legality of funding cutoffs for sanctuary policies, Bondi’s office referred to a February memo in which she promised to “end funding to state and local jurisdictions that unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.” The memo cites a federal law saying local officials “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” communication about immigration status.
Local jurisdictions in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington joined a February lawsuit led by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California against a Trump administration executive order calling for defunding cities with sanctuary policies, calling the order “illegal and authoritarian.”
In April, a U.S. district court in California issued a preliminary injunction in that case preventing any funding cutoff over sanctuary policies to the cities and counties in the lawsuit. And on Friday, the federal judge, William Orrick, ruled that the injunction applies to any list of sanctuary jurisdictions the administration may target for funding cuts.
Trump’s new executive order seeking the list cannot be used as “an end run” around Orrick’s injunction, the judge wrote, while he decides the legality of detainer policies and other issues.
“The litigation may not proceed with the coercive threat to end all federal funding hanging over the Cities and Counties’ heads like the sword of Damocles,” Orrick wrote.

Legislators adjourned their regular session earlier this year without agreeing on a budget, with the House and Senate, both Republican led, in a bitter political fight over numerous issues. Now, they’re trying to reach a final deal before the fiscal year ends on June 30.
If lawmakers do not pass a budget before the new budget year begins July 1, then most state agencies would shut down or temporarily close, though some court rulings and legal opinions have stated that some core agencies could still function. 
Rep. John Read, a Republican from Gautier who leads the House Appropriations A Committee, said budget leaders were still at an impasse when they met last week, but he believes they’ll get closer to a final deal after returning to the negotiating table this week. 
“You’re trying to get from A to B, and we have three people involved in discussions now,” Read said. “And each person thinks they’re right.” 
House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann would typically be the two leaders in budget negotiations. But the third person heavily involved in the discussions now is Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, the only person who can call lawmakers back into a special session.
The state Constitution gives the governor the power to set the legislative agenda for a special session, not lawmakers. This gives the constitutionally weak governor a significant boost in political power over special session work.
The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment, but he said at a press conference recently that he wants legislative leaders to have at least a handshake agreement on the budget before calling them back to Jackson.  
Numerous rank-and-file lawmakers told Mississippi Today they have not received any formal notification from legislative leaders on when a special session might happen.
One of the major sticking points between the House and Senate is whether to pass a “Christmas Tree” bill, or a bill that appropriates hundreds of millions of dollars in local projects around the state. Read said the two chambers disagreed over other spending items, but he declined to elaborate on the specific disagreements. 
Christmas Tree bills are typically funded by excess state cash or borrowing, and the state currently has more than $1 billion in surplus. 
Legislative leaders often use the projects bill to reward members who vote in favor of their priorities or punish members wh0 oppose their plans, something that Sen. Jeremy England, a Republican from Vancleave, acknowledged in a social media post last week.
“What is the hold-up? The answer is this: ‘Project Money’ — also commonly called ‘Christmas Tree Items’ (because these ‘projects’ are handed out to members for their local districts, sometimes promised as incentives for votes on other items — particularly in the House, like gifts),” England wrote.
Speaker White has said House members are insisting the Legislature pass a local projects bill, but Hosemann, the Senate’s president officer, has said they’re reluctant to spend any excessive revenue on local projects, given looming federal spending cuts and a volatile national economy. 
“Senate leadership has met regularly with the House over the last couple of weeks, made progress on the budget, and will continue working on it this week,” Hosemann said in a statement. “We look to finalize it expeditiously. Given ongoing federal funding freezes and economic shifts, it is important that we exercise prudence in our spending as we craft this year’s budget.”
White’s office did not respond to a request for comment, but he told WAPT TV last week that an ongoing disagreement between the two chambers is over funding the public employee pension system and a Christmas Tree bill. 
The first-term speaker told the outlet that he wouldn’t be “much of a leader” if he didn’t reward mayors and supervisors with local project money after they supported his effort this year to pass legislation eliminating the individual income tax. 
The budget dispute comes as Mississippi is collecting less tax revenue than it did at this point last year, according to the latest revenue collections report from the Legislative Budget Office. 
The report states that year-to-date revenue collections through April are more than $78 million below last year’s collections, or roughly 1.23% less than the previous year.  In general, revenue collections have been trending down for months, but have been buoyed, in part, by strong interest earnings on the sizable pot of reserve funds the state has maintained.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06061413/3X0A2107-copy-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-14 07:04:47.478702

Some 57 percent of voters think that the cost of housing is a ""a big problem"" in their own communities, according to a new poll conducted by the MassINC Polling Group for Abundant Housing Massachusetts, and 68 percent think there aren't enough affordable homes in their own cities or towns. 
The post Voters support more action to boost housing, new poll find[...]","IN HOUSING DEBATES, it’s only a matter of time before critiques of damaging “neighborhood character” and some flavor of “not in my back yard” clash with assertions that the Massachusetts housing market is so squeezed that building almost anything at all should be a priority. Common wisdom usually boils down to residents wanting to preserve their community while home values rise, suggesting that other communities would be better suited for more units. But new polling conducted by the MassINC Polling Group for Abundant Housing Massachusetts – which is pushing two bills this legislative session to spur development – finds that majorities of voters feel that the state and their own communities alike are not doing enough to address the housing crunch. “Many polls have found housing at or near the top of the list of issues facing the state,” said Richard Parr, research director with The MassINC Polling Group, which is partly owned by MassINC, the nonprofit organization that publishes CommonWealth Beacon. “What more interesting is that voters think this is a problem their own communities should be doing more on.” Some 57 percent of voters think that the cost of housing is a “a big problem” in their own communities, and 68 percent think there aren’t enough affordable homes in their own cities or towns. By wide margins, Parr noted, voters favor building more housing over both protecting neighborhood character (71 percent to 21 percent) or preserving local control over what can be built (63 percent to 28 percent).  “All this suggests that the voices who speak out at community meetings against new housing projects are likely not a majority in their own communities,” he said. The poll surveyed 803 Massachusetts voters between March 17 and 20, with a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. Jesse Kanson-Benanav, executive director of Abundant Housing Massachusetts, said responses are aligned with the goals of a “Yes in My Back Yard” bill and a bill to study allowing apartment buildings up to six stories to be built with one stairway for more efficient use of square footage.  Majorities of voters polled offered support for policies like allowing construction on smaller lots, allowing owners to subdivide their lots and sell homes on those new parcels, allowing owners to determine how much paved parking area should be on their property, and single-stair construction.  “There’s been a lot of conversation in the press and the Legislature around zoning reform in particular and making sure we have the tools in communities across the Commonwealth to build the homes that Massachusetts residents need,” said Kanson-Benanav. “Some of the conversation has helped advance the perception that, broadly speaking, Massachusetts voters are opposed to state action that will make sure they have access to more variety in the types of homes they can choose to live in and the communities where they can live.” A voter survey finding support for these policies is a double boon for housing groups. Voters are more likely to be homeowners – 65 percent of respondents said they owned a home, indicating that even those with property values on the line would like to see more available housing near them – and engaged at the polls even if their contributions aren’t captured in public meetings. “Local control is important,” Kanson-Benanav said. “Local control is never going away. The Town Meeting form of government is never going away, but we have to balance that with the fact that the way it has played out is just not serving the needs of Massachusetts residents,” he said, plus “it’s not meeting the desires of community members broadly.” A few months into the lieutenant governor job, former Salem mayor Kim Driscoll touted her home city and Massachusetts as “welcoming and inclusive” but also attracting populations that are having trouble staying because of the housing affordability crisis. Statewide research in 2022 from The Boston Foundation found that officials and public meeting participants are demographically homogenous and in-person gatherings often oppose new housing. “Sometimes voices get crowded out,” Driscoll said on an episode of The Codcast in May 2023. “Sometimes newer local residents to communities don’t also engage in that same meaningful way. We’ve all taken stock of who’s participating during meetings, and oftentimes populations that show up at the zoning board hearing or at the city council or town meeting are older, whiter, more conservative, and housing secure and, frankly, often fighting new housing.” Local control and local character have become flashpoints in hashing out compliance with the MBTA Communities housing law, which requires the 177 cities and towns served by the MBTA system to rezone to allow for more multi-family housing.  Most polling, but not all, has found consistent majority support for the MBTA Communities law. Some towns have chafed against its requirements and the state’s toolkit for enforcing the law through the courts and by withholding grant funding, though all but four of the communities that must offer rezoning plans by mid-July are now complaint or in interim compliance, according to state counts. A graphic from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities displaying compliance with Section 3A, also known as the MBTA Communities law.Only Halifax, Marshfield, Middleton, and rebellion ground zero Milton have not yet submitted plans to the state. The state’s high court concluded earlier this year that the zoning law is constitutional and enforceable, though some towns are pushing back by arguing that the law is an  “unfunded mandate” because it imposes costs on the municipalities without providing a source of funding to address those costs.  An ongoing Plymouth Superior Court case was brought by the town of Marshfield against the state housing office, demanding an exemption from compliance. The court is considering a motion to dismiss the suit. Milton, meanwhile, is moving ahead with some grumbling. The town’s planning board will work into the summer to have a rezoning plan by the state’s July 14 deadline. At a Milton Planning Board meeting on May 8, several residents and planning board members continued to argue that the Mattapan High Speed Trolley line that passes through the eastern part of the town should not be considered comparable to other “rapid transit” options and therefore should come with a lower rezoning burden. Others expressed disappointment with the continuing back-and-forth over the rezoning process, describing the town as increasingly unaffordable to public employees and young people. Recent attempts to re-open the MBTA Communities debate through the state budget process have fizzled. An amendment offered by Rep. Kenneth Sweezey, a Duxbury Republican, but rejected by the chamber would have stripped the attorney general’s power to enforce the MBTA Communities law. The House dispensed with three MBTA Communities amendments – which would have extended the MBTA Community definition to all Massachusetts municipalities, expanded the definition of compliance, and excluded cities and towns without direct bus or subway service from being counted as an MBTA Community – offered by the House Republican leader Brad Jones, of North Reading, by opting not to include them in a consolidated amendment. The Senate, similarly, rejected amendments offering similar MBTA Communities changes proposed by Sen. Kelly Dooner, a Taunton Republican. Sen. William Driscoll, a Milton Democrat, withdrew an amendment declaring that the Mattapan High Speed Line “shall not be considered a rapid transit modality.” In the new Abundant Housing Massachusetts poll, surveyors did not measure specific support for the current version of MBTA Communities, but did ask if voters would support expanding the law to allow more housing options near public transit in all cities and towns with train and bus service statewide. Almost 80 percent said they somewhat or strongly supported the idea. The post Voters support more action to boost housing, new poll finds  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hull_Housing.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 06:00:52.660627

(Getty Images)I could potentially win the lottery. It could happen, but odds are it won’t. The same can be said for a meaningless executive order on drug pricing signed by President Donald Trump Monday containing no policy specifics and designed to distract Americans from the Republican assault on health care. 
That’s why it was disappointing to see a local news organization and health care advocates celebrating the executive order’s “potential” to lower drug prices. Don’t be fooled! The president has no real intention of lowering drug prices — this is all smoke and mirrors to disguise the fact that Republicans in Congress are actively working right now to rip away health care from millions of families to fund tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations — including Big Pharma.
Trump has always been all talk and no action when it comes to drug prices. He had four years to lower drug costs during his first term and accomplished nothing. In fact, drug prices soared under Trump. 
He installed Big Pharma executives in key administration posts and handed out huge tax breaks to big drug companies, cutting Big Pharma’s effective tax rate by 40 percent but did nothing to lower drug prices.
An executive order signed by Trump on April 15 instructs Congress to side with big drug companies and undermine Medicare drug prices negotiation, giving drug companies four additional years to charge as much as they want for certain drugs before they can be selected to have a lower price negotiated. 
This executive order is more of the same meaningless fluff. It includes no detail on the authority the administration would use to execute the plan, so it is unclear how such a plan would be operationalized or legal. It’s more about padding Big Pharma’s profits abroad than it is about lowering costs here at home. After all, these drug companies are driven by profit and greed.
So, why the distraction? Why now? After repeatedly denying that Medicaid would be cut or that people would be hurt and have their benefits taken away, Medicaid is currently facing the largest cut in its history. 
Under the cover of darkness on Mother’s Day, Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee released the text of their budget proposal, putting forth its plan to kick millions off their health care by enacting the largest cuts to Medicaid in history, raising costs on low-income families, closing rural hospitals, and enacting burdensome work requirements designed to deny people coverage. Millions of Americans — and  thousands of West Virginians — could lose coverage, including seniors, children, veterans, people with disabilities, workers who don’t get insurance through their jobs and people who take care of their children or elderly parents. 
In addition to draconian Medicaid cuts, Republicans are raising premiums and out-of-pocket costs for tens of millions of people who buy coverage on their own. These Republican price hikes will force middle-class families to lose their coverage altogether. 
House Republicans are betraying their own voters and making health care more expensive. Such drastic health care cuts will throw working families off coverage and into medical debt, take critical long-term care away from seniors and people with disabilities, shutter rural hospitals and leave children uninsured. This Republican budget will hurt people — all to give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans.
Republicans in Congress continue to lie about the devastating impact their budget will have on people and communities across the country because they know how cruel and unpopular their war on health care is. Poll after poll after poll — even Trump’s own pollster — has found the majority of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, oppose any cuts to Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. Yet, this Republican budget will give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the medical care and financial stability of everyone else.
Not a single dollar should be taken from health care to fund tax breaks for billionaires.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1026036240-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 06:00:52.660627

(Photo: NCGA screengrab)North Carolina House and Senate Democrats held a funeral of sorts Tuesday, highlighting the hundreds of bills they introduced this session that were then directed to the Rules Committees of the two houses, the proverbial legislative graveyard.
Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said Democrats introduced over 700 bills this session that were killed in committee.
“Common sense, community focused solutions to our state’s biggest problems — and they went nowhere,” Batch said. “Republicans didn’t debate or defeat these ideas. They shoved them in drawers, locked them behind doors, and they prayed every single day that the public never finds out how little they’re actually doing with their tax dollars that you will send to this state to run our government.”
Batch said gerrymandering has allowed Republicans, who chair the committees, to completely control which bills advance and which never see the light of day.
Sen. Woodson Bradley (D-Mecklenburg) said she came to Raleigh hoping to make communities safer, only to find her ideas silenced by the majority party.
“I may be a freshman senator, but I’m also a domestic violence survivor. I’m a responsible gun owner and concealed carry holder. I’m the daughter and wife of law enforcement. I know crime. I know cops. But more important than that, less than 5% of the people in this building know what it’s like to be a victim. And that’s who I came here to help,” said the Mecklenburg County Democrat.
  Sen. Woodson Bradley (D-Mecklenburg) said her simple two-page bill would have helped domestic violence victims. It was never debated.
Bradley said the ideas she championed were basic protections and deserved to be fully debated.
“We hear a lot from the other side about protecting families and standing with law enforcement. But if you won’t even bring a bill to the table that protects survivors of abuse or helps officers prevent gun violence, what are you standing for?”
Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) said that even ideas that had merit like allowing remote license renewals to ease the NC DMV backlog were dismissed, if the idea came from a Democrat.
“Democrats introduced real solutions for fixing what ails us in state government, hiring critical staff, investing in the infrastructure behind state services. But Republicans actually didn’t want to fix it. They wanted to exploit the failings to support their talking-point that government doesn’t work.”
Senate Bill 611 would have taken an estimated one million North Carolinians out of lines at the DMV allowing them to complete their task online, said Grafstein. But Republicans kept the bill bottled up and allowed it to die rather than make the May 8 crossover deadline.
“The Republican majority would rather have people stand in line all day and get frustrated because it fits that narrative that we just need to slash more and privatize.”
Rep. Lindsay Prather (D-Buncombe) said bills that would restore teacher longevity pay and establish a $17 an hour minimum salary for non-certified public school employees also failed to gain traction.
Legislative leaders also dismissed both the Voucher School Accountability Act and the Voucher School Transparency Act.
  Rep. Dante Pittman (D-Wilson)
“These are bills that would shine a light on private schools receiving public funds, giving more information to parents to make an informed decision, and more information to taxpayers on whether your money is actually going to provide a quality education to a North Carolina student.”
Prather said decisions not to take up those bills shortchanged North Carolina’s children and their parents.
“Not all hope is lost”
As a Captain in the US Army National Guard, Rep. Dante Pittman (D-Wilson) said he has learned not to surrender.
He’s still advocating this session for the Working Families Act (House Bill 786) that would raise the state’s minimum wage, increase the stock of affordable housing and reenact the child tax credit.
“Not all hope is lost. And I would offer for them to take these good ideas and include them in the budget.
Because what we’re trying to do here in North Carolina is make sure that our children have the opportunity that they need and our families are secure.”

(Photo courtesy WWBT)An overwhelming majority of voters are proud of Virginia’s colleges and universities and feel they are equipping young people to succeed, even as, across the country, frustrations mount due to rapidly shifting federal education systems and rising tuition costs.
According to poll results released by Virginia Business Higher Education Council (VBHEC), 90% of respondents both Democrats and Republicans in Virginia are proud of the colleges and universities in the commonwealth because they see a “strong connection” between the work on Virginia’s campuses, the prospects for the state’s economy to grow and for young people to succeed in the job market.
Virginia voters’ views contrast national surveys from the Pew Research Center and Third Way, which found both Republican and Democratic voters cited high costs as one of the key reasons for the lack of confidence in institutions over the past few years. While most Democratic respondents pinpointed rising costs and quality as concerns about the quality of higher education in America, Republican respondents said “professors bringing their political and social views into the classroom is a major reason why the higher education system is headed in the wrong direction,” according to the Pew survey. 
The VBHEC poll results found that 90% of Virginians want their children to attend one of Virginia’s public colleges and universities and 81% of respondents said Virginia’s colleges are doing a good job of preparing young people for success in a changing economy. Conversely, 21% of Republicans and 12% of Democrats said Virginia colleges are doing a bad job in these areas.
Public Opinion Strategies and Frederick polls, two national opinion firms representing both parties Republicans and Democrats, conducted the VBHEC study in December with 800 registered Virginia voters aged 18 and older. The margin of error for the survey is ±3.95%.
Founded in 1994, the VBHEC’s mission is to enhance the performance of Virginia’s public colleges, universities, and community colleges and their state funding so institutions can produce a significant impact on Virginia’s economy.
Dennis Treacy, chair of the Virginia Business Higher Education Council, said in a statement that the link between higher education, the growth of the commonwealth’s economy, and the lifelong success of its young people is “crystal clear” to all Virginians.
“They get it. They know that when we invest in our colleges, universities, and community colleges — making degrees and credentials affordable for all and providing work-based learning opportunities that prepare students for the jobs and careers of tomorrow — the commonwealth is stronger for it,” said Treacy.
Last year, CNBC named Virginia the best state to do business after examining the commonwealth’s K-12 public schools and higher education institutions.
Kirk Cox, president of the Virginia Business Higher Education Council and former Virginia House Speaker, said it’s “unusual” to find something that unites all Virginians, considering the current volatile political environment. He said the VBHEC’s poll results should send a message to all current and aspiring political leaders.
“Whatever disagreements voters may have on other issues, one thing that very large majorities in both parties strongly agree about is the need to prioritize investments in our top-ranked higher education so we maintain our competitive advantage as the ‘talent state’ and so young Virginians and career-changing adults have the credentials they need to succeed,” Cox said in a statement.

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)RICHMOND, Va.–Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed two bills for the development of small solar projects and energy storage that had won bipartisan votes and support from Dominion Energy, environmental groups and farm and forestry representatives.
The bills would have encouraged private homes and companies to initiate solar projects and bolstered the existing utility’s efforts to capture electricity from renewable sources for later use. Dominion said in April, in an application to purchase electricity from third-party suppliers, that enhanced solar production and its own plans to store electricity would result in billions of dollars of fuel savings through 2035.
Youngkin has described himself as an “all-of-the-above” energy supporter with plans to support fossil fuel sources as well as renewable technologies. Critics said the vetoes last week raise questions about his commitment to clean energy and illustrate his disdain for the state’s landmark decarbonization law, the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).
The Republican governor, enthusiastic about the development of data centers in the state, has in the past year supported a proposed natural gas peaker plant and renewable sources to encourage such development. But Youngkin rejected the current legislation over his concern that ratepayers for existing utilities, which are reliant on fossil fuel, would bear in part the cost of increased solar production, according to a statement released Tuesday.
“He does not support legislation that puts rate payers at risk,” Peter Finocchio, Youngkin’s press secretary, said in an email.
Regarding battery storage efforts, Youngkin said that he was relying on market forces. “Long-duration energy storage is an expensive technology and if utilities believed it to be the best technology to meet demand, they would actively be seeking permission to build them. We must be vigilant to limit cost increases to Virginia’s residents,” he said in a “veto explanation” released on a state website.
Josephus Allmond, a staff attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the governor’s action fit a pattern. For months, Youngkin has supported legislation to weaken the VCEA or completely repeal it, he said.
“I think the amendments just show who he truly is: not an ‘all-of-the-above’ guy. He just doesn’t like clean energy,” Allmond said. “It’s disappointing that the governor chose to engage with [the energy legislation] in such an unserious way. We thought we had good meetings.”
Dominion Energy spokesperson Aaron Ruby did not respond to requests for comment.
Legislation sponsored by Del. Katrina Callsen (D-Charlottesville) and Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg (D-Henrico) would have increased small solar projects to further diversify the state’s energy mix. “Regrettably, Governor Youngkin’s veto indicates a prioritization of political motives aligned with Washington rather than the interest of Virginians,” Callsen said in a statement.

The VCEA, passed in 2020, mandates that Dominion and Appalachian Power Company have carbon-free energy portfolios within three decades. The state utility regulator oversees an evolving system of credits that encourages utilities to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy production.
Beginning in 2021, Dominion was required to obtain renewable energy credits, equaling a percentage of its electricity sales, from renewable energy sources. Dominion satisfied its annual credit requirement, including a 1 percent stipulation for small solar projects, according to a 2023 regulatory filing. Callsen and VanValkenburg’s bill aimed to increase credit payments toward small solar projects and, in turn, generate such projects. Under the bill, Dominion would have been required by 2028 to pay 5 percent in renewable energy credits for small solar projects.
From 2029 through 2031, and every three years after, the state utility regulator would have set the energy credits levels for utilities.
The bill also considered some broader solar aims for Virginia. It sought more commercial solar projects, capable of providing up to 3 megawatts of electricity each, to comprise 1,100 megawatts in total. Those projects by private developers would contribute to the overall goal of 16,100 megawatts in solar power across the state by 2035.
Solar projects planned for brownfields, including landfills and former industrial sites that are underutilized, would have been required to have a capacity for 600 megawatts, tripling the current 200-megawatt minimum.
Dominion Energy, which supplies electricity in parts of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, supported the expansion of home solar users in part because the utility could benefit. The bill would have extended a deadline for Dominion to recover costs for its strategic program to install distribution lines underground from 2028 to 2032, and delayed a demand for Dominion to recover deficiency payments, or penalties for shortfalls in obtaining credits, from ratepayers. The utility expects an offshore wind project to be operational in 2026, which would offset its credit payments.

Youngkin, in his veto memo, balked at the renewable credit plan. Customers would likely have to bear the cost of Dominion’s renewable payments, he said, equalling billions of dollars over 10 years.
Allmond, of the Southern Environmental Law Center, said Youngkin’s cost numbers were inflated and ignored the benefits of new renewable sources, “including lower fuel costs.”
“If you actually look at those benefits and put it in context—Dominion customers will pay over $20B for fossil fuel costs alone over the next decade,” Allmond said in an email. “That number … does not include the health costs that those fossil fuels impose on the communities in which they are combusted.”
Clean energy industry representatives saw the veto as a lost chance. The bills would have increased an individual’s options for solar at home—by adding rooftop panels—and ease the overall demand in the state, said Jim Purekal, a director at Advanced Energy United, a national trade organization that represents clean-energy companies.
“If I’m putting solar panels on my house, I’m not charging Joe down the road for the solar panels. I’m paying for the solar panels,” Purekal said. “The energy that I’m generating off of the solar panels, I’m contributing to the grid. I’m not asking for Joe to pay for my solar panels, I’m just asking Joe to pay for the electricity that I’m providing to the grid.”
There are costs to changing the energy landscape, but time eases the burden, according to a recent report by the federal Energy Information Administration. “Distributed generation systems often cost more per unit of capacity than utility-scale systems,” it said in a 2024 report, but noted that savings would follow.
“Cost reductions are expected to continue in the coming years as component markets stabilize, component efficiencies continue to improve, customers and developers take advantage of federal and state incentives, and developers achieve economies of scale through alternative sales strategies,” the report said.
The second veto affected an energy storage and distribution bill, joint legislation from Del. Rip Sullivan (D-Fairfax) and Sen. Lamont Bagby (D-Richmond).
Their bill would have almost doubled traditional battery facility targets for Dominion as well as Appalachian Power Co., which serves a million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee. Dominion’s goal for battery storage facilities would have increased to 5,220 megawatts from 2,700 megawatts. Appalachian Power’s goal would have risen to 780 megawatts, from 400.
The bill would have also created long-duration energy storage targets so that electricity could be dispatched over a 10- to 24-hour period, including when sunshine and wind are not available.
Sullivan described the veto as dismissive of clean energy and the VCEA: “The governor just couldn’t bring himself to do the right thing for Virginia.”
“Instead of signing 2537, or even suggesting to us constructive changes, which of course we’d have entertained,” Sullivan said, “he has used it to give the Clean Economy Act one last sort of derisive swipe at the back of his hand as he prepares to walk out the door toward his next campaign.”
Virginia’s utility regulator, the State Corporation Commission, had approved Dominion’s proposed construction of long-duration energy storage facilities in 2024. On April 15, Dominion was approved to purchase electricity from third-party storage suppliers.
In its application leading to the regulator’s approval in April, Dominion said its plan for a combination of solar and the storage projects would “result in fuel savings of approximately $6.6 billion over the period of 2022 through 2035. Fuel savings for the full lives of all resources in this Development Plan which extend through 2073 are approximately $118.5 billion.”
Tension over the VCEA has percolated for years. Youngkin has called the VCEA a “quagmire,” and Republicans have derided the VCEA as a force that will increase electricity costs. Environmental groups have consistently played defense to prevent weakening of zero-carbon goals.
Beyond the vetoes, Youngkin approved a bill from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi (D-Richmond) and Rep. Phil Hernandez (D-Norfolk) to expand a “virtual power plant” pilot program to be designed by the state regulator. The program would allow ratepayers to agree to share electricity with utilities during peak strains on the system. Utilities then would draw electricity from home or business battery storage devices and adjust on-site smart thermostats to ease demand on the electric grid.
Angela Navarro, a former State Corporation Commission judge who has since opened up her own energy policy law firm, said thousands of customers could participate and help cope with electricity demand and their own energy costs.
“It’s expensive to provide power during those peak events,” Navarro said. “There’s scarcity on the grid. You are providing value, you are alleviating some of that scarcity and therefore you should be compensated for it.”

The region stood out for its high employment rate among mothers, robust remote work options, competitive income levels, and strong access to child care, education and healthcare. 
According to the report, 77% of mothers in the Washington region are employed — four percentage points above the national average. About 26% of those working moms have remote jobs, one of the highest rates among major metropolitan areas nationwide.
The metro area’s performance reflects both workforce trends and longstanding infrastructure. Working mothers here earn a median income of $70,000 — the third highest among the nation’s largest metros. 
And despite an average commute time of 32 minutes — longer than the national average of 25.4 minutes — many are offsetting that strain with flexible work-from-home arrangements and the growing availability of coworking spaces, with nearly seven available per 100,000 working-age adults.
Child care access is another factor lifting the region’s ranking. The area boasts roughly 1,000 child care centers and 100 schools per 100,000 children, helping it land sixth place nationally for education metrics. While child care costs average $13,800 annually — or about 9.2% of a typical family’s income — the availability and quality of services play a key role in supporting working parents, the analysis noted.
Health care access is also a major advantage. Nearly three-quarters of employed mothers in the region — 74.4% — receive employer-based health coverage, compared to the national average of 70.4%. Pediatric care is also robust, with approximately 591 pediatricians per 100,000 children under age 21.
The new ranking analyzed large metros based on employment rates for mothers, income, work flexibility, commute times, and access to childcare, education, health care and environmental quality. 
The Washington area ranked behind only one other large metro in the nation — Minneapolis — reinforcing its status as a leading hub for women striving to balance professional and parental responsibilities.
While air quality ranked 18th among large metros, the region’s overall infrastructure and support systems make it one of the most favorable places in the country for mothers trying to balance it all.
In addition to the region’s inherent strengths, recent legislative actions in Virginia aim to further support working mothers. The Virginia General Assembly passed a comprehensive “momnibus” package to improve maternal health outcomes, including legislation allowing doulas to assist during labor and increasing postpartum doula visits for Medicaid recipients. 
These measures address maternal health disparities and aim to provide better support for mothers across the state.
Furthermore, the legislature approved a $200 rebate for taxpayers and bonuses for state employees and teachers, providing financial relief that can benefit working families.
While proposals for permanent car tax credits and tax cuts on tips were excluded from the final budget, the enacted measures reflect a commitment to supporting working parents through both health care and economic initiatives.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio History Connection last week laid off a third of the staff at the State Office of Historic Preservation. Even though many of its responsibilities are mandated by the federal government, the feds haven’t provided funding that was appropriated in October, a spokesman said.
The money is provided by the National Park Service, which has been hammered by staffing and funding cuts from Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency.
The historic preservation office handles Ohio listings on the National Register of Historic Places, historic preservation tax incentives, and maintains a permanent record of Ohio’s historic buildings and sites, in addition to many other responsibilities. 
The Ohio History Connection, which oversees the preservation office, laid off 12 of its employees because it hasn’t received $1.448 million from the National Park Service despite the fact that the money was appropriated on Oct. 1, said Neil Thompson, the history connection’s manager of media and public relations.
In a note to history connection staff last week, Executive Director and CEO Megan Wood said the preservation office couldn’t maintain its staffing without the money.
“As a reminder, roughly 60% of (the preservation office’s) funding comes from the federal Historic Preservation Fund — administered by the National Park Service and supported by proceeds from offshore oil and gas leases,” Wood wrote. “Although these funds were appropriated for the current federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2024, they have not yet been released.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 “We have been working tirelessly with the Governor’s Office, our Board, and Ohio’s Congressional Delegation to advocate for the timely release of these funds. However, with the majority of our (historic preservation) budget allocated to personnel, we are unable to sustain our current staffing levels without this federal support.”
In 1966, Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act after years of mass demolition of historic sites and buildings.
“By the mid-1960s, federally-funded infrastructure and urban renewal projects had resulted in the rapid destruction of places significant in the nation’s history,” the National Park Service says on its website. “Congress recognized that the federal government’s historic preservation program was inadequate to ensure that future generations could appreciate and enjoy the rich heritage of the nation. (The National Historic Preservation Act) was enacted in recognition that historic places were being lost or altered, and that preservation was in the public’s interest.”
Among the things created under the law was the National Register of Historic Places, on which Columbus’s German Village has been listed since 1974. 
Workers in state preservation offices evaluate whether nominees make the register. Those decisions depend on how old they are, their historical significance, their architectural significance, and other factors, Thompson said. 
“It’s a federal program — a federal list that is ultimately put out by the Department of the Interior — but the State Historic Preservation Office is responsible for reviewing nominations to ensure all these factors are met,” Thompson said.
A more complete description of the preservation office’s responsibilities can be found here.
Some developers and homeowners might balk at historic preservation requirements, but historic preservation is popular with the public. For example, a 2014 UCLA survey found that “88% of respondents believe that historic places should be treated as community assets… (and) 83% of respondents indicated that historic preservation is somewhat to very important.”
The National Park Service didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The agency has been buffeted with cuts and threats of more since Trump took office and put the world’s richest man in charge of cutting government services.
In February, 1,000 probationary employees were cut from the park service and another 700 took buyouts. Now the Trump administration is planning to cut 1,500 more. The cuts already are said to have sewn chaos at the agency.
Despite the loss of personnel at Ohio’s State Historic Preservation Office, officials plan to continue doing what the law requires. 
“Despite this setback, we remain responsible for fulfilling our federally mandated duties, including the administration of the National Register of Historic Places, the Federal Historic Tax Credit program, and compliance reviews under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act,” Wood, CEO of the History Connection, told employees.
 “We know the coming months will be challenging, and that extended processing times may occur as we adjust to these changes. Nonetheless, we remain committed to our mission and to serving the people and communities of Ohio through the preservation of our shared heritage.”

A new study suggests that direct financial aid reduces parole violations and eases reentry. (Photo courtesy of the Center for Employment Opportunities)When Karina Lariz was released from a California prison in September 2021, she had only the clothes she was arrested in — stretched out and weathered by time. She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.

With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.











If I didn't have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did.


– Karina Lariz, cash assistance recipient



The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.
Efforts to release prisoners from long sentences draw new interest

According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
Legislation and pilot programs
A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.
‘Transformative’: More college programs are slowly coming into prisons

This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
Potential savings
In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.
How many inmates return to prison? Inconsistent reporting makes it hard to tell.

Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

(Getty Images)The New Hampshire Senate is set to vote Thursday on a bill aimed at creating a consistent building code across the entire state — by preventing local officials from creating their own rules.
If enacted, House Bill 428 — which was sponsored by Goffstown Republican Rep. Joe Alexander and co-sponsored by a group of his Republican colleagues — would forbid local officials in New Hampshire from amending the building code within their municipality, creating a uniform code across the state. This bill would leave the state Legislature as the only body able to amend that code. If enacted, it wouldn’t go into effect until January 2027, an attempt by lawmakers to give municipalities time to comply.
“Currently under state law, municipalities are able to make changes to the state code that are more stringent,” Alexander said when introducing the bill in January. “This causes the possibility of hundreds of different codes across the state. Can you see where that’s an issue?”
The House approved this bill through a voice vote in March after amending it to allow for variations in administrative rules, such as processes for applying for building permits or fees paid to building departments. Substantive changes to the building code itself remain prohibited under the amended bill. The Senate Executive Departments and Administration Committee voted, 4-1, to recommend the entire Senate approve the bill.
Rep. Carol McGuire, an Epsom Republican and co-sponsor of the bill, said during a hearing last month that “a number of municipalities have adopted amendments that severely undermine the ability of people to work between one town and the next.”
Alexander, McGuire, and their fellow co-sponsors argue that having so much variety between the building codes of different towns and cities makes it difficult for home builders who do business in multiple municipalities. Following these varying codes also increases their costs and makes homes more expensive, they argued.
“You have a patchwork of different types of building codes across the state, which makes it much more difficult for people to do business,” McGuire continued. “The principle is that we think if we have a state building code, it should be the state building code.”
Matt Mayberry, CEO of the New Hampshire Home Builders Association, commended the bill for helping ensure “one state, one code.”
Mayberry said he’s “not excited” that the bill waits until 2027 to take effect, “but I understand it, I guess.” He said he liked the bill because he’d rather see decisions made by the state Legislature over local boards and councils.
“I put my trust in 424 individuals to make those policy decisions for our state of New Hampshire versus a five-member town council or select board who may be more socially driven than policy driven,” Mayberry said.
Margaret Byrnes, with the New Hampshire Municipal Association, testified in January that her organization, which represents towns and cities throughout the state, opposed the bill. She said it would “take away established local authority to adopt local codes, which has been established in state law for many years.” She also urged lawmakers not to proceed with this bill until they can see the impacts of changes made by lawmakers last year requiring municipalities to submit their zoning amendments to the State Building Code Review Board for review.
“I would ask the committee to consider letting the legislation from last year play out before we go ahead and remove local authority to adopt local building codes,” Byrnes said.
A similar bill, Senate Bill 94, passed the Senate in March. Both bills forbid local building code amendments with slight variations. The House retained SB 94 in committee — which means it won’t advance to a floor vote for now — in hopes that language from both is merged into HB 428 and passed by the Senate.
A tight New Hampshire housing market
This comes after years of soaring housing prices in New Hampshire. The median home sale price in New Hampshire year-to-date was roughly $515,000 for single-family houses and $410,000 for condos, according to the New Hampshire Association of Realtors April report. That’s a 6.2% and 2.5% increase, respectively, from the same time last year, when the association reported an average sale price of $485,000 for single-family houses and $400,000 for condos. This exceeds the U.S. inflation rate, which was 2.3% for the year ending in April, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In April 2015, the median sale price year-to-date was roughly $227,000 for single family houses and $161,500 for condos, according to the New Hampshire Association of Realtors.
Economists point to the low supply of housing in New Hampshire as a driver of rising prices. In April 2025, there were 1,614 single family houses and 624 condos for sale in New Hampshire, according to the Association of Realtors. That’s up from last year when there were 1,227 single family houses and 487 condos for sale, but it’s down substantially over the course of a decade. In April 2015, there were 10,319 single-family houses and 2,134 condos for sale.
Housing is a major issue for New Hampshire voters. A poll commissioned by advocacy group New Hampshire Housing Action found that 55% of respondents considered New Hampshire’s housing shortage the number one issue facing the state. That’s more than inflation, taxes, homelessness, health care costs, and immigration. Similarly, Gov. Kelly Ayotte as well as both Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature have highlighted it as one of the most pressing issues and vowed to address it.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/newhomezoning-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 06:00:52.660627

Once a little girl roaming the vibrant fields of an organic lettuce farm in Kealakekua, Hawai‘i, Ella Kilpatrick Kotner learned how to live in harmony with the land before most kids learn how to tie their shoes. Nourishing the soils that gave her a regular supply of leafy greens was just a part of life. As was playing with the piles of compost on her family’s farm.
“Composting, for me, is a lot about community,” said Kilpatrick Kotner. “It’s about connecting people to food and soil, and it’s about learning and being engaged in the process, and meeting your neighbors, and treating this thing that many people think of as a waste as a resource to be cherished and handled with care and turned into something beautiful that we can then reuse to grow more food.”
She now leads a program at Groundwork RI, a nonprofit in Providence, Rhode Island, that does just that.
Every day, her team of three bikes throughout the city, collecting food scraps from hundreds of households, which are then brought to a community garden. There, they mix pounds of nitrogen-rich food scraps otherwise destined for landfills with carbon-rich materials, such as dry leaves and wood shavings, while sifting out pieces of plastic and even the occasional fork. In doing so, Kilpatrick Kotner is creating a menu and a habitat for the microbes that prompt the decomposition process, transforming the waste into a spongy source of life for the soil. The compost is then made available to those enrolled in the subscription-based service to use in home gardens, yards, or urban farms.
The U.S. wastes over one-third of its food supply, which contributes considerably to global greenhouse gas emissions, primarily as a result of the methane that is released when food decomposes in landfills. A decade ago, the Obama administration set a national target to cut the nation’s food waste in half by 2030. Many observers expected the first Trump administration to ignore that goal because of the implicit climate focus, so it came as a surprise when Trump doubled down on the benchmark.
Not only did Trump officials participate in the 2018 U.S. Food Waste Summit, but his first administration also launched the first interagency agreement to reduce food loss and waste. That involved formal commitments to the 50% food waste reduction goal from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, and the Food and Drug Administration.
Without any federal enforcement mechanism, though, that ambitious goal has remained out of reach. Americans still waste about 300 pounds of food per person each year, roughly as much food as they did almost a decade ago. Trump’s reasoning, anyway, had more to do with protecting economic gains — food waste costs the U.S. hundreds of billions every year — than climate benefits.

In 2023, the EPA launched the Community Change Grants Program, a congressionally authorized program to support community-based organizations addressing environmental justice challenges, which funneled in about $2 billion of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA. In December, Groundwork RI was one of nine organizations included in an $18.7 million community change grant awarded to the Rhode Island Food Policy Council. A portion of the three-year funding stream was intended to provide the nonprofit with the resources needed to expand its collection service to neighboring cities, build a bigger compost hub, renovate their greenhouse with its pay-what-you-can farmstand, and add composting bin systems to more local community gardens. It also would have made it possible for Kilpatrick Kotner’s team to launch a free food-scrap collection pilot with the city of Providence.
Now, in his second term, President Trump has made no secret of the fact that his administration is working to unravel climate action and justice-oriented programs across the government — and make it harder for state initiatives to pick up the slack.
On May 1, after months of the Trump funding freeze uncertainty, the partners involved in the Rhode Island food-waste project learned that the $18 million grant was terminated. The EPA’s official notice, shared with Grist, informed the grantees that their project was “no longer consistent” with the federal agency’s funding priorities and therefore nullified “effective immediately.”
Zealan Hoover, a former senior adviser to President Joe Biden’s EPA Administrator Michael Regan, doesn’t believe that Trump is specifically targeting food-waste initiatives, but rather environmental justice programs in their entirety.
“It’s clear to me, from the terminations that have been going out, from the statements that have been made, in court filings, and to the press, that EPA is in the process of sending termination notices to every grantee in the Office of Environmental Justice,” said Hoover, who led the agency’s implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law.
He noted that he believes the move to be “unlawful” as the IRA funding was allocated by Congress.
“As with any change in administration, EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities,” an EPA spokesperson told Grist. “Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.” The spokesperson did not respond to Grist’s request for clarification about the agency’s legal authority to cancel the congressionally authorized community change grant.
Michelle Roos, executive director at the Environmental Protection Network, which is a national volunteer network of former EPA staffers, told Grist that around 400 grantees have now had their contracts terminated. The number of grants targeted was first released by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works at the end of March. A recently filed court document revealed the EPA is planning to terminate 781 grants in total.
According to Hoover, in prior administrations, it was “exceedingly rare” for the EPA to terminate grants. “This is a huge break from precedent that is pulling the rug out from underneath local communities,” he said.
Nessa Richman, executive director of the Rhode Island Food Policy Council, also questions how the administration can end the $18 million community change grant. The lead-up to the project took more than a year to develop and had garnered support from several state departments and the Department of the Navy. “It is a sinking feeling,” said Richman, “that this opportunity that we, and our partners, had worked so hard for, and that our state was so ready for, is slipping away.”
The money was set to create 27 new local jobs, provide food scrap pickup for more than 15,000 households, build 37 food scrap drop-off locations across Rhode Island, and develop nine compost processing facilities, including a larger-scale one on land owned by the naval station. What’s more, it would have launched a local supply chain for redirecting excess food from institutions like schools and restaurants to food-insecure community members instead of landfills. And it would have made Groundwork RI’s pickup collection model freely accessible to the community members they serve — not just to help fight food waste, but to also learn how to take better care of the soil as they grow their own food.
“It’s easier for folks who have a little bit of disposable income to buy that countertop composting food scrap collector, or that 5-gallon bucket, and buy a service that comes and picks up their food waste at their door. It’s easier for them than for people who are working three jobs to make ends meet to take the time to separate out that food waste,” said Richman. “The loss of the funding, in a real way, doesn’t just slow down the reduction of the food waste, but it further establishes a divide.”
Richman estimates that at the end of the three years, the project would have diverted over 11,000 tons of food waste from landfill, which in turn would have prevented more than 15,000 metric tons of emissions.
Hours after she read the notification of their grant termination, Richman met an old colleague at a local coffee shop in Rhode Island’s East Greenwich. It had been many years since they’d seen each other, and the two sat together, catching up until the shop closed.
As they talked for a while longer in the parking lot, Richman watched in frustration as one of the coffee shop’s employees carried two bags of perfectly edible pastries and threw them in the dumpster.

Ohio House Bill 2, proposed legislation that creates a cost-sharing model for child care, passed the House Children and Human Services Committee on Tuesday, moving the measure for possible full House vote.
The language of the bill is the same as language included in the House version of the budget, passed last month. That budget proposal is still awaiting final approval, as the Senate works on its own draft before the two chambers come together to reconcile their drafts and create a final draft to send to the governor by the end of June.
House Bill 2 would cap child care assistance at 400% of the federal poverty level. The cost-sharing model in the bill would split the cost between the employer, employee, and the state, after an employer applies for the financial assistance. The state would put in 20% of the cost, and the employer and employee would each pay 40%, according to the bill.
Child care providers are not required to be a part of Step Up to Quality, the state’s child care and early learning provider rating system, under the bill.

The bill was passed 12 to 1, with only state Rep. Sarah Fowler Arthur, R-Ashtabula, voting against it.
“I do still have some significant concerns with the fact we incentivized, through Step Up to Quality, a number of providers to not be providers for the last period of time,” she told the committee.
She added that she stood against the bill “because I have concerns about the state subsidizing child care going forward.”
Fellow Republican state Rep. Tracy Richardson, of Marysville, voted in favor of the bill, but looked to the future of the measure and the language in the budget for needed changes.
“I will support the bill, but I want to publicly state that I believe that our finance committee may have some work to do on this bill, maybe look at perhaps some potential reduction in overall funding,” Richardson said.
She said the same thing about a second bill passed by the committee on Tuesday, a bill which would appropriate $10.25 million each for the next two years for grants aimed at expanding “child care capacity” and establishing an employer-based child care learning lab, among other resources for grant applicants.
Ohio House Bill 41 would require the Ohio Department of Children and Youth to oversee a grant program “to assist employers in retrofitting or equipping their onsite or near-site child care facilities, in building new child care facilities, or in partnering with child care providers, government entities, nonprofit organizations or others on initiatives to create child care capacity within their communities to support the workforce,” according to an analysis of the bill by the Legislative Service Commission.
“I see this being a potential, really strong pilot program, providing dollars necessary for those facilities that matter, particularly in areas where we are most impoverished,” Richardson told the committee before voting in favor of the bill. “I do think, fiscally, our finance committee should take a closer look at the overall appropriation.”
Fowler Arthur voted against the bill, along with Rep. Gary Click, R-Vickery, but neither made statements as to why they were voting against the second child care measure.

In recent years, the conversation surrounding mental health has gained much-needed momentum. Yet within this broad discussion, maternal mental health remains an area that is often overlooked.
As a family medicine physician, I’ve witnessed firsthand the challenges that mothers and families experience in the face of poor maternal mental health. It’s essential that we prioritize maternal mental health resources to foster healthier families and communities. 
The journey of motherhood is often portrayed as a time of immense joy, but it is important to acknowledge the concurrent challenges. Pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period can bring about significant physical, emotional, and psychological changes. Unfortunately, many women experience mental health issues during this time including anxiety, depression, and postpartum mood disorders. 
In New Hampshire it is estimated that approximately 1 in 8 women experience significant symptoms of postpartum depression or anxiety. Despite these numbers, many mothers suffer in silence, often due to stigma or a lack of resources. The consequences of untreated maternal mental health issues can be severe; a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry found approximately 5% of all mothers in the 9-12 month postpartum period commit suicide and less than 40% of these women sought professional help prior to their suicide attempt. 
This turmoil affects not only the mother’s well-being but also the child’s development and the family’s overall dynamic. 
Another study published in JAMA Psychiatry found that untreated maternal depression is linked to adverse child outcomes, including behavioral problems and developmental delays. The risk of developing behavioral problems in children can increase by approximately 20-50% when maternal depression is present. These issues can manifest as conduct disorders, hyperactivity, or social difficulties. 
The likelihood of developmental delays, particularly in areas such as language and cognitive skills, can increase by about 30-40% in children whose mothers experience untreated depression. Children are also more likely to experience emotional problems, such as anxiety and depression, with estimates suggesting a 20-30% increase in risk. Social interactions and peer relationships can also be adversely affected.
Addressing maternal mental health can significantly reduce these adverse outcomes. For instance, interventions that effectively treat maternal depression have been shown to reduce the risk of behavioral problems in children by up to 40% and improve cognitive development significantly. Moreover, addressing maternal mental health concerns can enhance the overall emotional and social development of children, leading to better long-term outcomes.
In response to these pressing issues, New Hampshire has taken significant legislative steps to address maternal mental health through initiatives like Senate Bill 246, also known as the “Momnibus 2.0.” This bill aims to improve access to mental health resources for mothers by enhancing screening, education, and support services within the state. By mandating that health care providers offer screening for postpartum depression and related conditions, SB 246 represents a critical step forward in ensuring that mothers receive the care and support they need during this vulnerable period. Additionally, the bill promotes the development of community-based programs and resources, recognizing the importance of local support networks in addressing maternal mental health.
Investing in maternal mental health resources is not only a compassionate approach but also a practical one. Early intervention and support can prevent the escalation of mental health issues, reducing the long-term burden on health care systems. Programs that provide education, screening, and treatment for maternal mental health should be integral components of prenatal and postnatal care.
Community-based programs and support networks play a critical role in this effort. Establishing peer support groups, offering parenting classes, and creating safe spaces for mothers to share their experiences can help reduce feelings of isolation and empower women to seek help.
Health care providers, policymakers, and communities must work together to destigmatize maternal mental health issues and ensure access to necessary resources. With the approval of this bill as part of the state budget, we not only support mothers but also invest in the future well-being of our society.
The importance of maternal mental health cannot be overstated. As we continue to advance our understanding and support of mental health more broadly, let us not forget the unique challenges faced by mothers.
By prioritizing maternal mental health resources, we pave the way for healthier families and a brighter future for all.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/depressed-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 05:01:07.171223

Ohio House Reps. Sean Patrick Brennan, D-Parma, and Jim Hoops, R-Napoleon, introduced Enact the Hunger Free Campus Act earlier this year and it had sponsor testimony Tuesday in the Ohio House Workforce and Higher Education Committee meeting. 
Ohio House Bill 157 would require the Chancellor of Higher Education to create the Hunger-Free Campus Grant Program and award hunger-free campus grants which could, for example, create an on-campus food pantry or a partnership with a local bank, provide students information about SNAP, have an emergency assistance grant available to students, or have a student meal plan credit donation program.

“A Hunger Free Campus program addresses these challenges directly by providing accessible resources and support systems tailored to meet students’ nutritional needs free from stigma,” Brennan said. “Such initiatives ensure that no student has to choose between paying the electric bill or buying textbooks or groceries, allowing them to concentrate fully on their education.”
H.B. 157 would appropriate $625,000 for fiscal year 2026 and 2027 for the program. 
Some universities across the state have a food pantry on campus for students, but how they operate varies, Brennan said. 
“There is not consistency on where the pantries live, the size, what is offered, what department they are under, and what you have to prove in order to utilize them,” he said. “Sometimes it’s a single staff member going to the local grocer on their day off to buy things for the pantry.” 
Food insecurity is often an overlooked issue that affects many college students, Brennan said. 
“Rising costs are making it tougher for students to find sustainable and affordable food options, especially for the growing number of non-traditional students with children,” he said.  
Food insecurity is an issue that goes beyond hunger, Brennan said. 
About 23% of college students experienced food insecurity in 2020 and 59% of food-insecure students potentially eligible for SNAP did not report receiving benefits, according to a report released last summer by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. 
A survey conducted last year at Ohio State University showed that nearly one out of every three Ohio State students is food insecure, according to the student newspaper The Lantern.  
Food insecurity means a household has limited or uncertain access to enough food to meet their needs, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
“It affects students’ academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being,” Brennan said. “When students are unsure where their next meal will come from, they struggle to focus in class, perform poorly on exams, and are more likely to drop out.” 
Similar legislation has passed in California, Washington, Oklahoma, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Massachusetts. 
“This bill will place Ohio at the forefront of tackling food insecurity in America and serve once again as a beacon by which more states will soon emulate,” Hoops said.  
Brennan introduced a similar bill in the previous general assembly, but it only had sponsor testimony. 
Members of the committee had positive things to say about H.B. 157. 
“I remember working in college full-time, but still it was difficult to afford food alongside my medicine, and so this is, no doubt, hopefully passes and will support a lot of students,” said state Rep. Munira Abdullahi, D-Columbus. 
State Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio, D-Gahanna, asked Brennan and Hoops about the importance of students being nourished in order to learn.  
“If you don’t have a full belly, the last thing you’re thinking about is loading the three branches of government,” Brennan said. “The same would be true for anyone, for that matter, whether you’re an elementary school kid, a middle school, a high school, or in our higher ed classrooms.” 
State Rep. Kevin Ritter, R-Marietta, asked where the line is? 
“Just because we can do it, should we do it?” he asked. 
Brennan responded by saying he views this bill as an investment in young people. 
“When we invest in people that are hard-working and want to move ahead and climb that socioeconomic ladder, it’s going to save us in the long run,” he said.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)In May 1993, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole addressed the annual public radio conference at an early morning session, introduced as “one of the toughest critics of public broadcasting.”
Saying he shouldn’t be thought of as an enemy, Dole then gave the crowd a dose of the sardonic wit for which he was well known: “I’ve already had breakfast. And by the way, Big Bird never tasted better.”
When he ran for president three years later, Dole’s campaign issued a position paper including his stance on public broadcasting: Dole “opposed the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as well as the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities and supports their elimination.”
Although he didn’t succeed in his presidential bid, Dole’s position was perfectly in line with the Republican Party.
“Every Republican President since Richard Nixon has tried to strip the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) of taxpayer funding.”
That quote comes from the “Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,” also known as Project 2025. It calls for the elimination of this “tyrannical situation” in which “PBS and NPR do not even bother to run programming that would attract conservatives.”
Project 2025 calls for “the 47th President” to use their bully pulpit to persuade Congress — especially members of their own party — to support the total elimination of funding for public broadcasting: “CPB receives advance appropriations that provide them with funding two years ahead of time, which insulates the agency from Congress’s power of the purse and oversight. This special budgetary treatment is unjustified and should be ended.”
To be clear, CPB is not a government agency. It’s a private, nonprofit corporation created by an act of Congress in 1967 during the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. The advance funding approach is intended to insulate public broadcasters from partisan politics.
It’s not surprising that President Donald Trump would follow through on Project 2025’s plan to eliminate funding from the budget, but as with many other actions he has taken recently, he chose to issue an executive order to accomplish the goal expeditiously. His order gives the CPB board until the end of June to revise its community service grants in a way that would “prohibit direct or indirect funding of NPR and PBS,” contending that “neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.”
Signed May 1, the order “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media” also calls for the immediate cancellation of funding, ignoring the advanced funding formula intended to shield public media from political pressures.
The leaders of PBS (the Public Broadcasting Service) and NPR (National Public Radio) were quick to respond.
Katharine Meyer, NPR president and CEO, issued a statement the next morning: “The President’s order is an affront to the First Amendment rights of NPR and locally owned and operated stations throughout America to produce and air programming that meets the needs of their communities.”
Her counterpart at PBS, Paula Kerger, released a more terse statement referring to it as a “blatantly unlawful Executive Order, issued in the middle of the night.” She noted that PBS is exploring all options to continue with its mission.
While challenges to this executive order, which may well be overruled by the courts, are playing out, managers of local public broadcasting stations must consider how to deal with the potential loss of revenue. Stations receive grants directly from CPB and pass much of the money along to PBS and NPR to cover the cost of the national programming as well as to cover the cost of local productions and broadcast transmissions.
In a letter addressed to listeners of Kansas Public Radio, based at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, director Feloniz Lovato-Winston notes that federal funding amounts to 10% of the station’s budget.
“Critical funding for Kansas Public Radio is just steps away from being eliminated,” she writes, “and could result in a loss of approximately $244,000 per year.”
At KTWU, the PBS station licensed to Washburn University in Topeka, that figure is significantly higher at approximately $865,000, which is about 30% of the station’s budget, according to general manager Val VanDerSluis.
Stations in western Kansas, located in a less densely populated region, face even more challenging circumstances. From her office in Bunker Hill, Betsy Schwien, general manager of Smoky Hills PBS, which serves western Kansas, reports that federal funding accounts for about 48-49% of its annual budget.
At High Plains Public Radio, with offices in Garden City and Amarillo, Texas, the current annual operating grant of $222,000 from CPB amounts to about 15% of its annual budget.
“Without this funding,” says executive director Quentin Hope, “HPPR would be hard pressed to continue its current levels of service, including operating transmitters reaching the most rural areas of the High Plains.”
Such broadcasts to rural areas in Kansas can be traced to the early 1920s, when professors from Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University) drove over to Milford to present lectures on KFKB, a radio station operated by “the Goat Gland Doctor” — J.R. Brinkley. In 1924, K-State launched its own station, KSAC, broadcasting educational programming to listeners across Kansas and beyond.
When the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 was taking shape, the general manager of KSAC, Jack Burke, served as chairman of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters. He played a key role in a lobbying effort to include radio in the legislation in addition to TV.
Ralph Titus, an announcer for KSAC (later identified as KKSU), joined the committee that determined how NPR would function. When the first edition of “All Things Considered” premiered on NPR in 1971, Titus was on air locally to welcome it. A timeline of KSAC’s history credits the station with providing more stories than any other in the nation during NPR’s first decade.
I should note that I used to be employed by public broadcasting in Kansas, serving as a producer and host of the “Sunflower Journeys” series as well as producing documentaries (like “Goat Gland Doctor,” narrated by Titus) and community affairs programs. I still produce documentaries that appear on public television occasionally, but I left my position at KTWU 10 years ago this month to return to my roots as an independent producer.
The effort to defund public broadcasting seems particularly alarming and sinister to me, as does the elimination of funding for institutions such as the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts, not to mention other draconian cuts that have been made in the name of “government efficiency.”
It raises serious questions about the objectives of those initiating these actions. Is this really only a matter of conservatives following through with their vision of America and making good on their promises to restore “family values” and the like?
Trump has denigrated and demonized journalists since he began campaigning, calling us “enemies of the people” and speaking of “witch hunts” and “fake news.” His executive order related to public broadcasting must be viewed in the broader context of his attacks on other media outlets, all of which suggests he’s following an “authoritarian playbook” to circumvent the Constitution and the safeguards built in to our system of democracy.
Will our congressional representatives take any actions to protect us? It doesn’t look very likely.
However, I did come across a series called “The Open Mind” featuring an extended interview with Sen. Jerry Moran that was distributed to PBS stations across the nation last year. Following a conversation over lunch at a small cafe in Hays, the host travels with Moran to Plainville, the small town where he grew up.
The conversation continues as they walk through the stacks of the Plainville Memorial Library, where Moran recalls the time when he worked at the library as a teenager, helping organize its collection according to the Dewey Decimal System. He obviously has an appreciation for libraries, which makes one curious about how he felt when Trump issued the executive order directed at the federal agency that provides grants to libraries and museums: the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).
I also wonder what he thinks about how the director of the Library of Congress, Carla Hayden — the first woman and person of color to lead the world’s largest library — was summarily dismissed for no apparent reason, leaving the impression that it most likely relates to the administration’s fervor in eliminating any ostensible DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) hires.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt basically said as much: “There were quite concerning things she had done at the Library of Congress in pursuit of DEI.”
One of the recent additions to the vast archives of the Library of Congress during Hayden’s tenure did indeed have a considerable amount of content related to diversity and inclusion as well as equity. I can attest to that fact because I produced some of it.
In partnership with the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, the LOC has become a repository for selected locally produced programming. I received notification from Rochelle Miller, the archives project manager, last spring that our local series about Kansas history and culture has been included: “Early seasons of ‘Sunflower Journeys’ are now preserved and stored by the Library of Congress for future generations.”
I contacted Moran’s office in Washington, D.C., to ask about his response to the recent order involving public broadcasting. Although an aide indicated that I might expect to receive a response for this piece, I had yet to receive one Tuesday.
The same is true for an inquiry I made of my U.S. representative, Derek Schmidt, who continues to revel in what he sees as great accomplishments of Trump, whose “first 100 days have been success after success — and he’s just getting started.”
That assessment is listed on a special page of the White House website, along with those of most other Republicans in Congress, including Sen. Roger Marshall, who echoes Schmidt’s assessment: “The President’s first 100 days is a return to American greatness.”
Do you suppose they also agree with and support Trump’s characterization of those employed by PBS and NPR as he posted on his Truth Social platform?
“RADICAL LEFT ‘MONSTERS’ THAT SO BADLY HURT OUR COUNTRY!”
The only monster I’ve encountered in my years with public broadcasting is one who’s obsessed with cookies!

(Getty Images.)For nearly 60 years, Head Start has quietly done what so many government programs promise but few deliver: strengthen families, support work, and invest in children without expanding bureaucracy.
In every Ohio county, from our most rural hills to our busiest cities, Head Start helps families chart a better course. It ensures young children have a strong start in life and gives working parents the peace of mind they need to stay on the job, pursue education, and build economic security.
In today’s economy, where 72% of Ohio children under age six live in homes where all parents work, access to safe, reliable child care isn’t just a convenience — it’s a necessity. 
And for many low-income families, Head Start is the only option. Head Start accounts for one-third of publicly funded care in Ohio, and in rural counties, that increases to well over half of all publicly funded care. 
Any reduction or disruption would create child care deserts where working parents would face impossible choices: leaving the workforce, relying on unreliable care, or falling into deeper financial hardship. 
Protecting and expanding Head Start overall is thus not a narrow programmatic choice but a foundational investment in Ohio’s workforce stability, educational equity, and community resilience.
During the 2023–2024 program year, more than 31,000 Ohio children, including over 8,000 infants and toddlers, relied on Head Start. And behind those numbers are tens of thousands of working parents who were able to earn a paycheck, contribute to their communities, and set a stronger foundation for their families. 
That’s what Head Start really is: an economic engine as much as an educational and family empowerment one.
The program’s design reflects many of the values we hold dear in Ohio. Funding flows directly to local organizations, not federal agencies, so decisions are made by people who know their communities best. Local leaders assess needs, direct resources, and are held accountable for results. It’s government at its most responsive and efficient.
And the results speak for themselves. Children who participate in Head Start are more likely to graduate, more likely to avoid the criminal justice system, and less likely to rely on public assistance down the line, and the benefits carry on to the children of former Head Start students. 
That’s not just good for families — it’s good for taxpayers. For every $1 invested in Head Start, we see up to $9 in long-term returns. That’s not frivolous spending — it’s smart, conservative investing in Ohio’s future.
What’s at stake now isn’t just early education. It’s the stability of thousands of families and the workforce participation of parents across Ohio. Policy changes, regional office closures, and continued funding uncertainty threaten to destabilize the very systems that keep working families afloat, especially in communities where child care options are already limited.
We need Ohio’s congressional delegation to stand strong for Head Start, not as a partisan issue, but as a pro-family, pro-work investment that delivers real returns. This program is helping Ohioans do what they’re already trying to do: raise their children, work hard, and build a better life.
Our children and our economy deserve nothing less.

Local sheriffs are on the front lines in deciding whether to participate in the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. But states increasingly are making the choice for them.
More and more, sheriffs’ hands are tied no matter whether they do — or don’t — want to help with deportations, though they often get the blame when conservatives draw up lists of sanctuary cities.
“‘Naughty lists,’ as we call them, are not super helpful here,” said Patrick Royal, a spokesperson for the National Sheriffs’ Association. “We all know there are places like Colorado where you can’t [help with deportations], and places like North Carolina where you have to.”
Cooperation between sheriffs and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lies at the heart of the Trump administration’s immigration detention policy. The administration plans to punish noncooperative jurisdictions with funding cuts — though many legal experts agree that cooperation is voluntary unless state or local laws say otherwise.
Advocate: Ohio’s county jails are no place for migrants

Sheriffs, who typically run local jails, must decide what to do when faced with immigration detainers — requests from ICE to hold onto incarcerated people up to two extra days so ICE officers can show up and arrest them. ICE issues those detainers when the agency reviews fingerprints sent electronically for background checks as part of the jail booking process.
Otherwise, arrested suspects who post bond or are otherwise released by a judge might go free despite their immigration status, prompting ICE in some cases to pursue them in the community.
In North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden ran on a platform of limiting cooperation with ICE  when he was elected in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, in 2018. But today, McFadden must comply with detainers because of a state law passed last year.
In a now-retracted Facebook post, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in late April accused Mecklenburg and several other North Carolina counties of “shielding criminal illegal immigrants” as sanctuary jurisdictions. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said in the post he was writing federal legislation to prosecute sanctuary jurisdictions.
“You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both,” McFadden said. He added that he’d like more choice about whether to comply with detainers. A federal funding cutoff would endanger important jail programs such as rape counseling, he said.
“Everybody’s focused on immigration like that’s the biggest fire, and nobody wants to address the other things. The losers will be the prisoners who need all these services we provide,” McFadden said.










You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both.


– Sheriff Garry McFadden, Mecklenburg County, N.C.


Conservative sheriffs in Democratic-controlled states also can be frustrated by state policy on detainers. Sheriff Lew Evangelidis of Worcester County, Massachusetts, said he’s been criticized for releasing prisoners wanted by ICE but sometimes has no choice: A 2017 state Supreme Court ruling prohibits holding prisoners based on detainers.
“If they [ICE] want this person and consider them a threat to public safety, then I want that person out of my community. I want to keep my community safe,” said Evangelidis. He supported a Republican-sponsored effort in the state legislature to allow 12-hour holds for ICE if a judge determines the prisoner is a threat to public safety, but the amendment was voted down in April.
States act on detainers
Many experts agree that ICE detainers can be legally ignored if states allow sheriffs to do that.
“That detainer request is just that, a request, it’s not a requirement,” said Cassandra Charles, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is opposing Louisiana’s lawsuit to reverse a court-ordered ban on cooperation between Orleans Parish and ICE.
The general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, Eddie Caldwell, agreed that the detainers are voluntary under federal law.
The association supports a state bill now under consideration that would require not only the 48-hour detention but also a notice sent 48 hours before release to let ICE know the clock is running. The proposal has passed the House.
The notification matters, Caldwell said, because there can be criminal proceedings that take weeks or months, so ICE in many cases doesn’t realize the 48-hour window has started.
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

Tillis’ office said the senator’s disagreement with McFadden, a Democrat, and other sheriffs is about that notification.
“It’s not necessarily that [sheriffs] are breaking the law, but rather making it as difficult as possible for ICE to take prisoners into custody by refusing to do some basic things. Notification is important,” said Daniel Keylin, a senior adviser to Tillis.
States including California, Colorado and Massachusetts ban compliance with the ICE detainers, on the general principle that it’s not enough reason to hold people in jails when they’re otherwise free to go because of bail or an end to their criminal cases. Those three states have made recent moves to defend or fine-tune their rules.
California’s attorney general also has issued guidance to local jurisdictions based on a 2017 state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities. That law withstood a court challenge under the first Trump administration.
Colorado has a law against holding prisoners more than six hours longer than required, and a new bill sent to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week would specify that even those six hours can’t be for the purpose of an immigration detainer.
Iowa, Tennessee and Texas are among the states requiring cooperation with detainers.
And Florida has gone further, requiring sheriffs to actively help ICE write detainers though official agreements in which local agencies sign up to help enforce immigration laws.
Cooperation boosts arrests
Such cooperation makes a big difference, experts say — jails are the easiest place to pick up immigrants for deportation, and when local sheriffs and police help out, there are more arrests.
“A larger share of ICE arrests and deportations are happening in places where local law enforcement is cooperative with ICE,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director for the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program, speaking at a recent webinar.
“A declining share of arrests and deportations are happening from places like California, where there are really strict limitations on local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE,” she added.
ICE is making about 600 immigration arrests daily, twice the rate as during the last year of the Biden administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking at the same event.
Reports on deportations are incomplete, Chishti said, but he estimated the current administration is on track to deport half a million people this year and is trying to get that number higher.
“The Trump administration has not been able to change the laws that are on the books, because only Congress can do that,” Chishti said. “It’s going to take congressional action for the Trump administration to achieve its aim of higher [arrest and deportation] numbers.”
Here’s the latest on how states are cooperating with Trump’s deportation plans

President Donald Trump has added more pressure, last month requesting a list from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of sanctuary cities, which he says would face funding cuts. The administration also has sued some states, including Colorado, Illinois and New York, over their policies.
Asked for comment on the legality of funding cutoffs for sanctuary policies, Bondi’s office referred to a February memo in which she promised to “end funding to state and local jurisdictions that unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.” The memo cites a federal law saying local officials “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” communication about immigration status.
Local jurisdictions in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington joined a February lawsuit led by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California against a Trump administration executive order calling for defunding cities with sanctuary policies, calling the order “illegal and authoritarian.”
In April, a U.S. district court in California issued a preliminary injunction in that case preventing any funding cutoff over sanctuary policies to the cities and counties in the lawsuit. And on Friday, the federal judge, William Orrick, ruled that the injunction applies to any list of sanctuary jurisdictions the administration may target for funding cuts.
Trump’s new executive order seeking the list cannot be used as “an end run” around Orrick’s injunction, the judge wrote, while he decides the legality of detainer policies and other issues.
“The litigation may not proceed with the coercive threat to end all federal funding hanging over the Cities and Counties’ heads like the sword of Damocles,” Orrick wrote.

(RUNSTUDIO/Getty Images)Finding ways to support older adults during trying times is not new. In 1965, Congress passed the Older Americans Act to complement the medical role of Medicare and Medicaid.
The challenges faced by older adults were increasingly clear, especially those with limited means. However, even those with means required support.
Recognizing the need to contract for services and oversee the delivery of programming led to the creation of 614 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) across the United States. The current system in Nebraska consists of eight AAAs serving urban and rural aging adults.
Stepping in
At the time AAAs came about in 1973, the 65-and-older population in the United States consisted of a little more than 20 million people. Today there are currently 58 million people who are 65 and older. By 2060, the projected number of older adults will reach 88 million.
The intent for AAAs is still focused on ensuring older adults with the greatest social and economic need can access services while living in the community. This is in addition to people seeking a sense of meaning and purpose. What we are discovering is older adults with and without means present with more unique and complicated needs.
What is the difference between aging adults then compared to today? More are living to 85 and beyond and doing so alone. While most older adults rate their health as good, there are others who face functional limitations and require extra help.
For those with family, caregivers are supported by AAAs through case management and related services. Yet not everyone has the family support they need to maintain their independence.
Filling the gap
The ability of Nebraska’s AAAs to fill in the gap for people without family or other sources of support is due to funding for such programs as the Older Americans Act, along with state and local sources.
To taxpayers, the question of whether these services matter is important to consider.
During 2024, Nebraska’s AAAs provided 1.4 million congregate (senior center) and home delivered meals to those ages 60 and older. They also provided $2.3 million worth of direct help including housekeeping, chore services and Lifeline support. For those needing coordination of services, 7,900 clients trying to stay in their home received case management services.
For older adults living in rural areas, AAAs can be lifesavers. Retirement communities, assisted living, and even nursing home care found in more urban areas are often a vanishing or non-existent commodity. Staying in the home is often their best and only bet when other options no longer exist.
Saving tax dollars
In addition to providing services, AAAs offer people seeking ways to give back an opportunity to find meaning and purpose while at the same time saving taxpayer dollars. In 2024, volunteers from ENOA delivered an impressive $2.6 million worth of support to the community.
Aging includes giving along with receiving care. And what may not be known is the role AAAs play during emergencies like global pandemics, power outages, and other life-changing events. They are the first to lend a hand and a meal to our aging neighbors to give them the support when needed most.
As the number of older adults increases, who will be there to provide support? A sluggish fertility rate has left fewer adult children to provide care to people as they age along with the closures of traditional sources of support in more rural areas.
In thinking about the future, if AAAs did not exist, there would be an ever greater need to create them to assist aging Nebraskans and their family caregivers. Support for these organizations and the people they serve is critical in 2025 and beyond.

Gavin Newsom says Donald Trump is a ""bully,"" but he's no stranger to using bullying tactics himself, especially to force local governments to obey his commands.","One of Gavin Newsom’s political ploys is to depict political rivals as bullies and himself as someone who stands up to them.
Last September, for example, he devoted an entire segment of his podcast, “Politickin’,” to denouncing Donald Trump, saying he is “a bully. But here’s the thing about bullies — they’re weak.”
That was before Trump was elected and before Newsom had to play nice in hopes of securing billions of dollars in federal relief aid for fire-damaged Los Angeles County. After initially saying he would provide such aid during a visit to L.A., Trump began hinting on imposing conditions on California, such as tightening up voting requirements and loosening up on water deliveries to farmers. 
Newsom then reverted to his previous role as a leader of resistance to Trump.
Yes, Trump does use bullying tactics to get his way. He uses aggressive policies — such as tariffs on imports — as a negotiating tactic. So does Newsom.
One example is the campaign his office is waging among the media to discredit USC Professor Michael Mische, who projected that as California loses in-state refinery capacity, gasoline prices could soar to more than $8 a gallon.
If Newsom believes that Mische is wrong, an effective response would be some research that proves it. But rather than refute Mische’s analysis, the administration has been planting suggestions that Mische is employed by Saudi Arabia, even though his advice to that nation ended years ago.
Newsom is never shy about forcing local governments to obey his demands, whether it’s making more land available for housing or being more aggressive about clearing encampments of homeless people. Newsom periodically threatens to withhold funds from or take legal action against cities and counties he deems to be negligent, emulating Trump’s tactics against states that won’t bend to his will.
It happened again this week when Newsom released $3.3 billion in bond money for housing and treatment of the mentally ill and homeless populations.

Homelessness 
Newsom wants cities to force homeless Californians to move camp every 3 days 

by Marisa Kendall 





“It is time to take back the streets,” Newsom said during a virtual press conference. “It’s time to take back the sidewalks. It’s time to take these encampments and provide alternatives and the state is giving you more resources than ever, and it’s time, I think, to just end the excuses.”
Newsom unveiled a model anti-camping ordinance he wants local officials to adopt and hinted that there would be consequences for those who balked.
“I’m not interested anymore, period full stop, in funding failure,” he said. “I want to see real results, and you’ll see in my budget on Wednesday that we’re going to hold that line.”
After receiving Newsom’s latest admonishment, local officials issued their latest defense.
Jeff Griffiths, Inyo County supervisor and president of the California State Association of Counties: “No, the state has not done everything it can to address homelessness in California. Without clear responsibilities for every level of government and reliable funding for cities and counties, successful local efforts will wither on the vine.”
League of California Cities executive director Carolyn Coleman: “When it comes to addressing homelessness, the question is not how many cities have encampment ordinances. It is whether cities have the ongoing funding from the state to match the scale of the crisis. Cal Cities stands strongly behind its position that now is the time for the state to invest in ongoing funding for all cities, big and small, to address homelessness.”
Bullying or political hardball? It’s difficult to discern the differences between Trump’s demands on states and Newsom’s on cities and counties. And if Trump’s bullying stems from weakness, what about Newsom’s?",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/092623_Newsom-Gun-Bill-Signing_MG_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 04:03:29.993803

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA three-judge federal court panel spent an hour in a downtown Atlanta courthouse Tuesday hearing arguments from attorneys about whether a conservative Texas organization’s mass voting challenges during a 2021 runoff violated the federal Voting Rights Act by intimidating minority voters.
Plaintiff Fair Fight Action, founded by Stacey Abrams, argued in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit that U.S. District Court Judge Steve C. Jones erred in ruling last year that True the Vote’s challenge to 365,000 Georgia voters’ eligibility did not constitute intimidation prior to historic Democratic Senate victories in Georgia when Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff prevailed in the Jan. 5, 2021 runoff.
At least one of the judges expressed skepticism about the soundness of the lower court ruling.
Mass voter challenges have been a mainstay in Georgia since the 2020 presidential election, when Democrat Joe Biden narrowly defeated Republican Donald Trump by about 12,000 votes in the state.
According to Fair Fight Action and others who filed suit, True the Vote’s actions likely violated the Voting Rights Act by using inaccurate voter registration information and voter intimidation tactics such as posting citizen watchdogs to monitor people casting ballots.
On Tuesday, the federal panel peppered the attorneys with questions while acknowledging the case’s national significance on voting rights protections.
Attorney Jake Evans, representing True the Vote, asserted that the intent behind the mass challenges was to protect election integrity.
Evans said that the mass challenging of voters’ eligibility prior to the 2021 runoff did not amount to voter intimidation.
Fair Fight’s attorney, Uzoma Nkwonta of the Elias Law Group, argued that although Jones acknowledged recklessness in his ruling, the district court erred in not following the generally accepted standard for taking a substantial step towards the course of action that led to the injury.
Nkwonta referenced the Muscogee County election board having to take up more than 4,000 challenged ballots from the 2020 November general election based on faulty national change of address data.
“Not only was it foreseeable, it’s exactly what True the Vote wished for and exactly what True the Vote demanded,” Nkwonta said. “True the Vote issued press releases, prepared one-pagers, considered suing counties and did everything in their power to force (Muscogee) County to take the very action that they took.”
“The voter intimidation statutes have been enforced since the 1960s and even earlier, and they often involve cases in which individuals were applying laws or taking actions that were permissible in every other scenario, but were impermissible because they were intimidating voters,” Nkwonta said.
Evans said that over the course of a seven-day trial the voters who testified did not provide proof of how they were intimidated by True the Vote. He argued the plaintiffs have failed to prove a violation of the Voting Rights Act.
“An attempted act has to be traceable to the alleged intimidation,” Evans said. “Here, there are three individual voters where there is no connection. There is no alleged challenger that’s submitted to challenge these individuals. It’s completely untraceable.”
Judge Federico Moreno said he disagreed with Evans stating it was an “open and shut appeal.”
“I don’t know about the substantive 11 B claims, but I think the district court committed legal error with regard to the attempt,” Moreno said, referencing a section of the act that bars voter intimidation. “Attempt is generally defined, both in civil and criminal law, as the intent to carry out an objective and taking a substantial means toward doing that.”
Moreno provided an anecdote about how a bank robber told a teller, “Give me the money in your drawer” before then being thwarted by a security officer.
“That person has attempted to commit bank robbery, even though he has not stolen the money because he was stopped by a third-party intermediary,” Moreno said.
In addition, Moreno questioned Evans about whether an organization that filed several hundred frivolous voter challenges could be considered an attempt to intimidate voters.
Evans said that True the Vote did not use tactics to intimidate voters like other cases where robocalls were used to threaten voters or Native Americans were targeted by sending people to follow them into polling places.
“Judge Jones looked at the evidence,” Evans said. “He evaluated the demeanor of the witnesses. He saw the witnesses testify, evaluated the totality of the evidence, and he made a factual finding in his order that said that there was no intent by True the Vote to intimidate any voter, any witness.”

Wes Moore (D) signed what he called “the most comprehensive piece of Chesapeake Bay legislation that Maryland has seen in years,” at a time when federal cuts threaten environmental programs for the estuary.","Nia Nyamweya, founder of Beauty Bloom Farms in Montgomery County, presents Gov. Wes Moore (D) a basket of greens from her farm for the signing of the Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act, one of 171 bills signed into law Tuesday. (Photo by Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed what he called “the most comprehensive piece of Chesapeake Bay legislation that Maryland has seen in years,” at a time when federal cuts threaten environmental programs for the estuary.
The Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act was signed Tuesday, one of 171 bills signed into law if the fourth and next to last bill signing ceremony following the 2025 legislative session.
The wide-ranging Legacy Act allots “up to $900,000 per year” to a new certification program for farmers who use sustainable practices that decrease runoff into the bay, establishes a water quality monitoring program to unify current testing efforts and aims to streamline oyster aquaculture leasing, among other provisions.
“At a time when we see how our federal administration has stepped back from protecting our air and our water, Maryland is stepping up,” Moore said.
The governor also signed an abortion grant program that will help fund abortion services for uninsured and underinsured individuals, and a bill allowing individuals with autism and other nonapparent conditions to add an identifying symbol to their state IDs. That, and Tuesday saw the approval of a new state mineral, chromite, and a new state cocktail, the Orange Crush.
Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act
President Donald Trump (R) and his Department of Government Efficiency have already cut positions at the Chesapeake Bay Program, which administers the bay cleanup, as well as at agencies whose work touches the bay, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. DOGE also threw environmental grant programs into chaos by freezing funds, some of which were later unlocked.
But advocates say Trump’s proposed “skinny” budget for fiscal 2026 would go considerably further, and “devastate” efforts to clean up the estuary, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
A ‘chrometastic’ finish for one state symbol bill

The bill would hack $5 billion from the EPA, including $2.46 billion in cuts that would “cripple” programs that help sewage treatment plants reduce pollution into waterways like the bay, according to CBF. Trump’s proposal would also slash $1.3 billion in grants and research programs at NOAA and $564 million at the U.S. Geological Survey, eliminating climate-related work to “focus on achieving dominance in energy and critical minerals.”
Allison Colden, the bay foundation’s Maryland executive director, said the federal losses make Maryland’s Bay Legacy law even more important.
“With federal cuts and rollbacks looming heavily on our state, Maryland’s environmental leadership is more important than ever,” Colden said in a statement. “This Act will help maintain forward momentum and ensure that investments in clean air, clean water, habitats, and local economies are secured.”
The new law came in a challenging budget year, during which lawmakers had to correct a multibillion-dollar deficit by cutting programs and raising fees.
As drafted, the bill would have allocated $2 million to the Leaders in Environmentally Engaged Farming, or LEEF, program, but budget-conscious lawmakers cut that to “up to $900,000” a year. The budget reconciliation process further reduced the sum to $500,000 for next fiscal year, with some of that money contingent on the Maryland Department of Agriculture submitting a plan for program spending.
“Unfortunately, we saw less coming out of the state budget for that program than maybe we would have liked to see,” Colden said. “But the point is, we have that program established. They have some initial seed funding.”
With funding and other incentives, Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks said the LEEF program will encourage farmers not only to pursue environmentally friendly practices, but to engage the community and share information about the practices with others.
“It incentivizes them in a way that we believe farmers and the community will rally behind and will make extra progress,” Atticks said.
As he signed the bill, Moore was backed by Nia Nyamweya, who brought a basket of leafy greens harvested from her Beauty Bloom Farms in Montgomery County. The produce and flower farm aims to regenerate the soils, formerly used for corn and soybean farming, with organic practices and cover cropping, according to its website.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Nyamweya leases her farm land from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Moore said. The bill codifies the practice in state law.
“That kind of partnership is rare, but the Bay Legacy Act will make these kinds of lease agreements easier,” Moore said.
The bill drew some early concerns for its massive scope, touching on everything from agricultural practices to a Japanese fish processing technique called ikejime. Delmarva Fisheries Association Chairman Robert Newberry called it “an ag bill with a side salad of fishery management and aquaculture.”
He initially balked at a provision that would have removed DNR’s obligation to produce its own fishery management plans for a variety of species, from white perch and blue crabs to croakers and horseshoe crabs, deferring to plans created by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.
The final law requires DNR to keep producing state-level plans for blue crabs, oysters, white and yellow perch, and a few other species, but it lifts the requirement for others, such as menhaden, spot and black sea bass.
In the end, Newberry supported the Bay Legacy bill. In particular, he appreciated an amendment that added specificity to an existing law preventing discrimination against groups of fishermen, adding fishing guides and charter boat captains.
Newberry has been among a group of fisherman fighting rules from the Atlantic States Commission limiting charters to one rockfish per person, beginning last year.
“I wanted to have the fisheries specifically defined,” Newberry said. “So that protects us.”
Abortion grant program
Maryland will also have a new grant program that will help fund abortion services for uninsured and underinsured individuals using a stockpile of unused premium surcharges, now that Moore signed House Bill 930 and Senate Bill 848 into law.
State officials, advocates fear impact of expected Medicaid cuts in House bill

“Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access,” Moore said.
The legislation prompts the Department of Health to tap into about $25 million in premium surcharges that were required as part of the federal Affordable Care Act but have not yet been spent down.
That money is the $1-a-month fee that insurers in the ACA marketplace are required to collect on every policy to fund abortion services for their policyholders. But that fund has been growing by about $3 million annually as collections have outpaced need.
Moore said the legislation builds off previous efforts to expand abortion access in the state, calling it the “next chapter in our work to protect and defend basic health care rights.”
Eric’s ID
Moore also signed legislation known as “Eric’s ID Law” that will let people with nonapparent disabilities, including autism, have a butterfly icon added to their driver’s licenses, to alert police officers and other officials that they are interacting with someone with a disability that may not be immediately visible.
Lt. Gov Aruna Miller noted that the “thoughtful and compassionate initiative” was inspired by Eric Carpenter-Grantham, a 20-year-old Montgomery County resident with autism, one of the nonapparent disabilities identified in House Bill 707 and Senate Bill 618.
Eric’s Law has been in the works for several years, in collaboration with members of the disability community, finally receiving House and Senate approval this past session, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) noted.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0197-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 01:58:00.264212

(Photo courtesy the Maryland Transportation Authority)Maryland went back to court against the Trump administration again Tuesday, saying an administration plan to withhold funds from states that do not comply with White House immigration policy amounts to a “grant-funding hostage scheme.”
Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown was one of 20 Democratic attorneys general who filed the lawsuits in U.S. District Court for Rhode Island against the departments of Transportation and Homeland Security.
Both suits say the administration does not have authority to withhold funds and that the lawsuits aim “to prevent the Trump Administration from trying to strong-arm them [states] into participating in federal immigration enforcement by threatening to cut off billions of dollars” in funding.
One suit names the U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy, and the other names the Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem.
Brown has already led or joined more than two dozen suits and amicus briefs since President Donald Trump was sworn into office Jan. 20. His office joined three last week along, including one that said the administration illegally withheld about $3 billion in previously approved funds for electric-vehicle infrastructure.
Trump orders list of ‘sanctuary cities’ to target for funding freeze

The suits filed Tuesday said Maryland received more than $42 million in federal money from FEMA last year, and that the state typically receives more than $1 billion a year in federal funding for transportation infrastructure, the state annually receives at least $1 billion.
“Our message on these lawsuits is straightforward: Maryland law, as passed by the General Assembly in 2021, clearly recognizes the federal government’s primary role in immigration enforcement while setting limits on state and local cooperation,” Brown said in a statement. “The Attorney General joined this action because the federal government is attempting to force Maryland to act against its own laws.”
On his first day in office Jan. 20, President Donald Trump (R) signed an executive order to direct the Homeland Security secretary go after so-called “sanctuary” cities and states that allegedly protect immigrants.
Administration officials were not backing down from those positions in the face of Tuesday’s lawsuits.
“The President has been clear on that,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs with Homeland Security, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, DHS is working to end violations of federal immigration law and remove criminal illegal aliens from American communities.”
McLaughlin continued: “Radical sanctuary politicians need to put the safety of the American people first—not criminal illegal aliens. The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that.”
Duffy, in a prepared statement released by his office Tuesday, said the “20 states are challenging the terms of their grant agreements because their officials want to continue breaking Federal law and putting the needs of illegal aliens above their own citizens.”
“No funding has been withheld,” his statement said. “What my Department has done is remind grant recipients that by accepting federal funds, they are required to adhere to federal laws.
But Gov. Wes Moore (D) backed Brown on the lawsuits, and said the state will continue to defend itself against “any threat.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“By forcing states to divert limited resources from protecting local communities, we stand to compromise the significant progress we have made on public safety over the last several years — including some of the most impressive crime drops in the entire country,” Moore said.
“The bottom line is this: threatening our security and transportation funding creates unnecessary risks, makes us less able to respond to disasters, and makes us less safe,” he said.
The suit against Homeland Security claims it’s forcing states to use “scarce” law enforcement and other state resources to follow federal civil immigration enforcement.
The DOT suit cites an April 24 letter from Duffy that requires all federal funding recipients cooperate in enforcing federal immigration law.
The lawsuit said states “would be unable to obtain compensation for the harms they would suffer as a consequence of an abrupt and unlawful denial of funding. The unlawful condition also inflicts additional irreparable harm on the States by infringing their sovereign rights, damaging public trust, and harming public safety.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/13697971305_08ce56a830_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 00:59:11.711327

Wes Moore before the signing of a bill naming chromite the official state mineral. Byron's great-great-great-great-grandfather discovered the mineral in Baltimore County more than 200 years ago. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A rainy Tuesday in Annapolis did little to dampen the spirits of 18-year-old David Shore. One might even say he had a “chrometastic” day.
Shore, the young mineral enthusiast who is known to sign emails “chrometastically yours,” traveled to the State House for the signing of a law designating chromite as the state’s official mineral, one of 171 measures signed into law Tuesday by Gov. Wes Moore (D).
“I’m elated,” Shore said moments before Moore signed the bill. “It took about half my life to get this bill through. I’m glad that a story of American success is being commemorated in Maryland with this bill.”
The ceremony brings to a close a nearly decade-long effort for Shore, who first testified in support of a similar bill in 2017.
Shore at the time was 10 and had his own lobbyist. Ashlie Bagwell, a lobbyist with Harris Jones & Malone, re-teamed with Shore and Sen. Craig Zucker (D-Montgomery), sponsor of the 2017 bill, for this year’s efforts. House Environment and Transportation Committee Chair Marc Korman (D-Montgomery) sponsored the House bill.
On Tuesday, Moore signed both the House bill, adding chromite to the official list of state symbols, and the Senate bill, which was amended to make Orange Crush the official state cocktail, along with chromite as the state mineral. The new law takes effect June 1.
“It was one of the bright spots of a tough session with everything that was going on at the federal level,” Zucker said of the bill’s passage. “It was a really hard session.”
When processed, chromite is a gritty, metallic charcoal-colored substance that is used in metal alloys, heat resistant materials and pigments. The mineral was first discovered in the Bare Hills area of Baltimore County in 1808 by Isaac Tyson Jr. Deposits were also found in Baltimore City and in Carroll, Cecil, Harford, Howard and Montgomery counties.
Tyson founded Baltimore Chrome Works. The plant was the first in the nation to manufacture chromium chemicals. The products were used in paints and in metal alloys including stainless steel.
The mineral was exported out of Fells Point. Deposits in the region produced most of the world supply of the mineral until the 1850s. South Africa is currently the world’s largest producer of the mineral.
Shore’s effort caught the attention of Tyson descendant Hannah Tyson Lee Byron, who attended the bill signing alongside Shore.
“I’m very proud of our Tyson family history, and to see my great-great-great-great-great-grandfather recognized for his discovery of chromite and the importance it played in Maryland and throughout the country and the world,” Byron said.
Chromite continues to be mined, though no longer in Maryland. But evidence of its past importance to the region remains in the names of many thoroughfares in Maryland,  like Chrome Road in Cecil County and Chrome Mine Road in Montgomery County. Abandoned mines can be found in some state parks including Soldiers Delight in Baltimore County.
Shore borrowed samples from Soldiers Delight Conservation Inc. to bring to the signing ceremony. Those samples get returned Wednesday, when the conservation group is scheduled to hold a small reception to congratulate Shore.

Chromite was not alone as it moved to the list of official state symbols.
Thanks to some 11th hour legislative shenanigans, the House tacked on the amendment to Zucker’s version of the bill that added Orange Crush as the official state cocktail. The language was not present in Korman’s bill, which passed earlier.
The cocktail was the subject of its own House and Senate bills that seemed destined for failure in the 2025 session. The late change is the latest volley in a squabble with Delaware over the origins of the drink.
The First State named the gin-based drink its official state cocktail last year despite its origins in the Free State.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the House and Senate “eventually … had a number of conversations about moving forward, about how can we make this session and find some things that everyone’s going to really be proud of and take back from Delaware what was rightfully ours from the beginning.”
Chromite and the Orange Crush will join 24 official state symbols. The list includes both a state sport and team sport, a state dinosaur, dog and cat, and crustacean, among others.
The last state symbol added was rye whiskey in 2023. It was the first time in 15 years that a new state symbol made the list. In 2008, the legislature approved an official state exercise (walking) and official dessert (the Smith Island cake).",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0393-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 01:58:00.264212

The best way to attract that investment, they say, is with a New Markets Tax Credit program.","With a shaky economy and uncertainty at the federal level, Tom Coale and Ryan Dressler argue that now is the time for the state to invest in a state-level New Markets Tax Credit program. (Photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)Maryland is a state with great economic opportunity, but it is not equally distributed. From Baltimore’s disinvested neighborhoods to Western Maryland’s struggling small towns and the Eastern Shore’s underdeveloped commercial corridors, too many communities lack the resources and capital needed for sustainable economic growth.
In the context of fiscal headwinds and uncertainty with the federal workforce, now is the time for the state to invest in a state-level New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program, modeled after the federal program. A $5 million annual investment each year for four years in the form of a tax credit (foregone tax revenue) — for a modest total of $20 million—would leverage significantly more private capital, spur job creation and provide a path forward for economic sustainability that is not dependent on federal spending.
The federal NMTC program was created in the year 2000 to encourage tens of billions of dollars of private investment in low-income communities. It provides tax credits to investors who fund projects in economically distressed areas, such as business expansions, mixed-use developments and community facilities. The program has a proven track record of attracting private investment, creating jobs and revitalizing neighborhoods, and is often the source of the first dollars invested in a redevelopment area.

From 2003-2023, the federal NMTC financed 115 projects in Maryland, creating 15,200 permanent full-time equivalent jobs. But even with this notable impact, Maryland is far behind its peers in utilizing the program.
Through fiscal 2023, Maryland was ranked 19th among the states in NMTC allocation invested in projects located within the state at $1.3 billion, far below neighboring Pennsylvania, ranked ninth at $2.6 billion.  Since 2007, 14 other states—including Ohio, Louisiana, Florida, Maine, Missouri, Illinois, and Nevada—have successfully implemented and renewed state NMTC programs. The federal program will award one of the largest amounts in program history in late 2025 – a full $10 billion of investment – but Maryland will need to develop a track record of success to compete.
Economic benefits of a Maryland NMTC program

Leveraging Private Investment: One of the most compelling reasons for Maryland to adopt a state NMTC program is its ability to attract private capital. Historically, every $1 of NMTC allocation generates $8 in private investment. This means that Maryland’s $5 million annual investment would yield $40 million of immediate program investment and encourage over $160 million of total private investment over the life of the program.
Revitalizing Maryland’s Most Distressed Communities: Many of Maryland’s struggling communities lack the infrastructure and commercial activity needed to drive economic growth. A state NMTC program would target investments in areas with high poverty rates, low median incomes and high unemployment, ensuring that resources reach those who need them most.


Baltimore City has numerous neighborhoods that would benefit from an infusion of investment to support small businesses, workforce development centers and community spaces.
Western Maryland, which has struggled with the decline of manufacturing and coal, could use NMTCs to fund tech hubs, tourism-related businesses and health care facilities.
The Eastern Shore, where agriculture and seafood industries remain dominant but undercapitalized, could see expanded processing facilities, cold storage infrastructure and commercial hubs.

These investments would not only stimulate business activity but also create jobs, improve property values, and enhance community services.

Job Creation and Workforce Development: The NMTC program has a strong track record of job creation. Projects funded by NMTCs often lead to construction jobs in the short term and permanent jobs in retail, manufacturing and services. For example, an investment in a new grocery store in a food desert would create construction jobs during development, retail jobs upon opening and supply chain jobs for distributors. A state-of-the-art vocational training center could train workers for high-demand industries such as health care, cybersecurity and clean energy, helping Marylanders gain skills and secure higher-paying jobs.

A Maryland NMTC could also be structured to small startups, and projects with strong community benefits, ensuring that economic growth is both inclusive and equitable.
Maryland has a choice: Continue relying solely on federal programs and risk losing out on critical investments, or take proactive steps to spur economic revitalization through a state New Markets Tax Credit program.  Time is of the essence to position Maryland to fully participate in the large allocation of federal New Markets Tax Credit spending later this year.
Maryland has long been a state of innovation and economic opportunity. A state NMTC program would reaffirm that commitment, ensuring that every community — urban, rural, and suburban — has the resources it needs to thrive.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/open-1.jpg,,,2025-05-14 00:59:11.711327

This call is in response to atrocities committed by Israel against the Palestinian people, in Gaza and the West Bank, during the past 19 months, and for decades prior. For over six decades, the U.S. has provided military aid totaling hundreds of billions of dollars (adjusted for inflation). This aid has supported Israel’s aggression against the Palestinian people and its seizing of their land and land from neighboring countries. 
The magnitude of attacks against Palestinian civilians since October 2023 has been determined to be genocide by Amnesty International and others, as well as ethnic cleansing. The U.S. has the moral obligation to stop providing aid to Israel in the form of military weapons and technology, and to support the rebuilding of Gaza’s infrastructure.
The ceasefire that began January 18 ended when Israel resumed military strikes in Gaza on March 18. It is essential that the U.S. use its considerable influence to ensure that a permanent ceasefire be established, which needs to include (as outlined by Jewish Voice for Peace): (1) withdrawal of Israeli military from Gaza, West Bank, Lebanon and Syria; (2) guaranteed unrestricted aid and reconstruction for Gaza; and (3) Israel being held accountable for its crimes against humanity.
Israel’s heightened military actions in Gaza during the past 19 months have created an outsized number of deaths and level of mass destruction. Israel has killed at least 50,000 Palestinians, the majority of whom were women and children. This is over 41 times the 1,200 deaths  reported to have been caused by the October 7 Hamas attack. While no number of civilian deaths is ever acceptable, this is an unfathomable ratio.
Since Israel ended the ceasefire on March 18, at least 673 Palestinians have been killed. In addition to those killed, there have been over 110,000 Palestinians wounded, approximately 90% of Gaza’s population displaced, and 69% of structures in Gaza damaged or destroyed. 
At least 169 journalists and media workers, and over 500 healthcare workers have been killed. The unprecedented and deliberate destruction of healthcare facilities, crops, livestock and water sources, and the obstruction of entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza strip have led to extreme hunger and catastrophic spread of disease.
Compounding the horror that is occurring in Gaza, for the past 19 months, the Israeli government has supported increased Jewish settlements (held to be illegal under international law) in occupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank and ramped up violent repression of Palestinians living there, further destroying Palestinians’ ability to live peacefully.
Some hearing these numbers will say, “What about October 7, 2023? Isn’t this self-defense?” It’s true that Hamas and other armed factions attacked Israel that day, taking 241 captives and killing up to 1,200 people (mostly Israelis).  This act has been rightly condemned internationally.  However, the Israeli government’s extremely disproportionate response is clearly not justifiable as self-defense. It amounts to the annihilation of a people. Israel’s actions have been condemned as war crimes and crimes against humanity by the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, numerous humanitarian groups, and multiple countries worldwide.
While the October attack was not directly provoked by a single Israeli action, Palestinians have suffered much at the hands of the Israeli government prior to 2023. Since 1948, Israel’s policies – including massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, forcible transfer, drastic movement restrictions, and the denial of citizenship and equal rights to Palestinians — are considered apartheid under international law according to Amnesty International  and others. For many years Gaza has been essentially an open-air prison.
The Northeast Connecticut Gaza Peace Group advocates for a permanent ceasefire, a ban on weapons and other military aid supplied by the U.S. to Israel, and the end of U.S. support for Israeli acts that the world recognizes as genocide, apartheid and ethnic cleansing. The U.S. must convey to Israel that military and colonial expansion into Palestinian territory is not acceptable. The proposed clearing of Palestinian people from Gaza coupled with taking over the Gazan waterfront for luxury real estate development is abhorrent. This greed-fueled ethnic cleansing must be rejected. 
Reconstruction of Gaza’s infrastructure will take many years and must be led by Palestinians. We believe that any solution to this crisis must be based on the commitment to secure the conditions for both Palestinians and Israelis to live with peace, dignity and justice.

Medications related to both obesity and eczema are very expensive.  Both have injectable drugs that have been FDA approved in the last eight years along with older, cheaper, less effective alternatives. The only difference is that the drugs for one condition are much more expensive than the other. 
The injectable Dupixent, used for eczema, is almost three times as expensive as the weight loss GLP-1 Wegovy, with a list price of $47,916 a year compared to $16,188.  But Wegovy is the drug that is getting pushback from insurance companies who don’t want to cover the cost.  Yes, Wegovy is probably prescribed more than Dupixent, but the GLP-1 would have to be prescribed at three times the rate of Dupixent to even break even in cost.  So, why will insurance companies cover Dupixent and not cover Wegovy?  
Insurance companies not covering obesity medications is indicative of how society perceives obesity and the bias against the disease.
In a 2023 study, physicians were found to lack education around individuals who are obese, categorizing them as difficult and resulting in diminished patient care.  Patients who encountered weight bias from medical providers were more likely to report feelings of depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and suicidal ideations.  Women report twice as many negative encounters with physicians as men and 40% of women who have a BMI over 35 report facing weight bias.  When insurance companies refuse to cover GLP-1 drugs they are advancing weight bias in the medical field.
In Connecticut, the Governor and the Department of Social Services (DSS) want to cut Medicaid coverage for GLP-1 drugs used strictly for weight loss, citing that the cost is beyond what the state can afford.  The message that they are sending to people who are obese is “we don’t care about your health; we only care about the money”.  Over the last couple of months, numerous GLP-1 users, including myself, have told their stories conveying just how life changing these drugs are.  GLP-1s for someone who has been obese their whole life could be the one treatment that helps them lose weight and keep it off.   As of June 15th, DSS has stated that they will no longer cover GLP-1 drugs that are used for strictly weight loss, perpetuating weight bias in their policies and going against current state law.
Connecticut legislators have already shown their support for the obesity community by passing PA 23-94 which supports Medicaid coverage for surgery and prescription drugs approved by the FDA for treatment of obesity.  During the 2025 legislative session, they have gone further with legislation to expand the definition of “weight loss drugs” to include GLP-1s approved by the FDA for weight loss (SB 1474).   
Support for these drugs will put pressure on insurance companies and DSS to cover these potentially lifesaving drugs, drugs that have been proven to be extremely effective for weight loss but also many other diseases including, Alzheimer’s, dementia, substance abuse, sleep apnea, fatty liver, Parkinson’s, PCOS, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, and is being studied in relation to many other diseases.  
Studies have shown that GLP-1s reduce inflammation in the brain and regulate anxiety as well as depression.  When insurance companies no longer cover GLP-1s, they are not only taking away medication that helps with weight loss they are taking away a drug that is helping that individual regulate their brain function.
The legislature along with DSS needs to prove to the obese community that they have their back.  This can be done by incorporating GLP-1s into the definition of “weight loss drugs” and continuing to find ways to fund this class of drugs.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-14 04:01:27+00:00,CT Mirror,This CT bill links AI innovation and accountability,Rock Vitale,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/14/ai-innovation-and-accountability-are-not-opposites-connecticuts-sb-2-proves-it/,"Smart regulation strikes the balance between social responsibility and innovation, and SB 2 does just that.","I founded Easie in 2018 to help organizations put AI to work on real problems, not theoretical ones. 
Our platform, EasieOps, pulls documents and PDFs from hundreds of data sources, extracts structured data using fine-tuned AI models and pushes that data into integrated downstream systems.
So I have a clear view of what AI looks like in practice. It is not science fiction. It is a tool that automates the essential parts of work that keep businesses moving, and it should be allowed to do just that. But because it already plays a role in high-consequence decisions about lending, housing, criminal justice and employment, we need to treat it with the seriousness those areas deserve. That is why I support SB 2, Connecticut’s proposed legislation on artificial intelligence.
As someone who works in AI implementation every day, I see this bill as a practical framework. It creates space for responsible progress and positions Connecticut to lead on one of the most important technological shifts of this century.
SB 2 is designed for the U.S. business environment. It does not impose blanket rules. It focuses on high-risk AI systems, where harm is more than hypothetical. It includes phased implementation and flexibility for businesses to adapt.
The largest companies building AI already follow many of the best practices put forth by the bill. Microsoft, Google and Amazon conduct bias audits, risk analysis and impact assessments. These are not bureaucratic hurdles. They are common sense for any system making consequential decisions, and these measures can protect businesses from unforeseen complications.
Even OpenAI has called for clear standards. In their words, just as drivers are expected to follow common-sense rules to keep roads safe, developers have a responsibility to follow standards that keep the AI roads safe. That encourages investment, competition and greater freedom for everyone. Smart rules make it easier to build, test and launch better systems by setting clear boundaries.
EasieOps, for example, has helped clients reduce manual entry by up to 99 percent while improving accuracy and auditability. It is already reshaping how work gets done in compliance-heavy industries. AI tools are powerful and the future for them is bright, but as such, they must be handled with responsibility.
SB 2 also emphasizes transparency. When people engage with an AI system instead of a human, they should know. When a system helps decide whether someone gets a job, a loan or a criminal sentence, there should be a way to review what happened. This fosters trust and supports adoption and growth.
SB 2 rightly phases in requirements and supports education for small businesses. Small businesses typically automate internal tasks, not high-stakes decisions. Regulations should reflect that difference. A startup should not face the same reporting burdens as a multinational corporation.
Thresholds based on revenue or headcount, along with clearer definitions of high-risk AI, and carve-outs for low-impact systems could help refine the legislation to further meet its goals.
Free tools like IBM’s AI Fairness 360 toolkit, Canada’s Algorithmic Impact Assessment Framework and the Ontario Human Rights Commission’s AI assessment guide help small companies comply without legal teams. Policymakers should promote these resources.
The sponsors of SB 2 have built a framework grounded in how AI is actually used. Reasonable accountability that supports AI innovation is within reach. Artificial intelligence, combined with sensible guardrails, can foster the kind of innovation that solves problems, works across industries and builds trust along the way.
Smart regulation strikes the balance between social responsibility and innovation, and SB 2 does just that.

They elected Douglas County Treasurer John Ewing Jr., the Democrat in charge of the offices where people annually pay their car taxes in the Omaha area, who has pledged a City Hall focused on providing better basic city services.

He campaigned hard on the idea that Omaha could build better streets, hire more police officers to fight more types of crimes, work with neighborhood groups, nonprofits and others to fight root causes of crime and help all parts of the city grow.
“Tonight we embark on a new chapter,” Ewing said to a cheering crowd. “Together we will build an Omaha that offers opportunity for the ‘good life’ — to everyone.”
Moments before, as he launched his victory talk, he pointed out a pastor in the crowd who, along with another minister, told him about 13 years ago that he was going to be Omaha’s first Black mayor. 
“I didn’t know if I truly embraced it at that moment,” he said. “But they said that to me with such conviction, it stuck with me.”
Ewing said he couldn’t have done it without his wife, Viv. He introduced his family, including his brother, daughters and parents seated in the front. “Mom and Dad, I hope you’re proud.”
To his supporters, he said a few times throughout the night: “I promised you guys we weren’t going to be outworked.” 
Went Ewing’s way early
Election night was going Ewing’s way from the start. After the first wave of results were announced, he told the crowd that this was the best he’s felt in weeks, noting the exhaustion of the last laps of campaigning. After the second round of votes was announced, Ewing punched a fist in the air and Viv threw both arms up. His margin grew to nearly 11,000 votes by 10:15 p.m.

Democratic leaders past and present packed the downtown Omaha Hilton for the Ewing celebration, including former Gov. Ben Nelson, former Mayor Jim Suttle and former State Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.
Ewing, a former high-ranking police officer, is the first Democrat to serve as Omaha mayor since Suttle engineered a victory in 2009 and revived the city’s finances before losing to Stothert after raising a new restaurant tax. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the City of Omaha by about 18,900 voters, according to the Douglas County Election Commission.
History made
Ewing also will become the first Black mayor of Omaha, having cleared the final hurdle that narrowly eluded former Democratic State Sen. Brenda Council of Omaha in 1997. She lost a close race to former Omaha Mayor and U.S. Rep. Hal Daub, R-Neb.
Ewing told the Examiner that since he became treasurer — and then became the first person of color in Nebraska to win a countywide election — he’d go into classrooms and say: “There’s nothing special about me.  What it means is that your dreams are possible, as well.”
“And that’s what I want them to see,” he said. 
Daub’s name was mentioned by many in the west Omaha crowd that gathered for Republicans on Tuesday night. Some had wondered whether Stothert, like Daub, might have overstayed her welcome despite having governed with significant popular support.
Voter fatigue?
Local political observers had predicted that Stothert’s biggest challenges were likely voter fatigue, unrest about the economy under President Donald Trump and the lack of a clearly articulated plan for a fourth term.

Stothert struck a proud and defiant tone in her concession speech, saying she leaves a city in much better shape than she found it. She has argued it has more money to repair roads, property tax rates that are lower and it is reviving the urban core with private donor partnerships.
“Tonight I’m very proud, grateful and hopeful. Proud of 12 years of success. I’m grateful for your support, your friendship and your trust. And I’m hopeful that the momentum we have created will continue,” Stothert said in a brief speech around 9:15 p.m.
She said she called Ewing and “congratulated him,” saying he is “inheriting tonight a great city.”
GOP soul-searching
Her supporters at Tuesday’s gathering at west Omaha’s A View on State included Gov. Jim Pillen and former Gov. Dave Heineman, along with former gubernatorial candidate Charles Herbster. 
Heineman, a longtime political activist before he ran, said Tuesday’s results show a changing Omaha, one that is increasingly Democratic-leaning in a ruby red Republican state.
“It’s been moving that way for some period of time,” he said. “The demographics of Omaha are changing.”
Pillen, who endorsed Stothert, said he was sad to lose conservative leadership in the state’s largest city. He said she had done a great job making the city one of the safest large cities in the country.
“That comes from leadership focused on what really matters,” Pillen said. “You know, as governor, I’m going to support the new mayor. That’s what we do in Nebraska. But yes, I’m disappointed. … I’m selfish. I wanted her for four more years.”
Race turned ugly late
Tuesday’s reflections were a marked change from the aggressive tone of the end of the race, which included attack ads on Ewing from the right about Democratic Party support for young people who are transgender and attack ads on Stothert from the left for the mayor backing Trump, whom she supported.

In an interview, Ewing said he thought Stothert’s attacks and “making things up” were desperate moves that hurt her. He said “people in this community … know me.” Stothert took no questions after her concession speech. But she has defended the attacks.
“This is not a national race where you can make up things and then people have to wonder if it’s true,” Ewing said. “They’ve seen what I’ve done in this city.”
This spring both candidates also lobbed back-and-forth attacks about each of their records. Stothert’s team criticized Ewing’s office for using a decades-old calculation for paying local school districts and governments that a state audit corrected.
Ewing’s team blamed Stothert for the city’s potholes, streets and inability to fill budgeted positions at the Omaha Police Department that Stothert added but sometimes struggled to fill with enough applicants to outpace retirements and departures.
Early voting mattered
Ewing’s campaign pressed its edge with early voting and door-to-door campaigning that showed up in Tuesday’s results when Ewing built an early 3,572-vote lead that the traditional GOP Election Day edge could not overcome. In fact, the gap widened in the second batch of results that included the first wave of Election Day votes, as well as the third.

On Tuesday night, Ewing repeated many of his goals, including improving public safety and adding to the city’s stock of affordable housing.
“To ensure that every Omahan has a place to call home,” he said.
Some Stothert supporters had wondered privately whether the mayor might suffer from people assuming she would win and not bothering to vote. With so-so turnout for an off-year city general election, enthusiasm proved a problem. County officials expect turnout to hit about 32%.
Ewing’s winning margin in the mayor’s race is likely to grow on Friday, when Douglas County Election Commissioner Brian Kruse’s office still has to count about 7,000 early voting ballots returned on Election Day. Those tend to come in as the early results do on Tuesday, which leaned toward Ewing.

Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, speaks against a legislative citation for political writer Suzanne Downing on Tuesday, May 13, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Four days after the Alaska House of Representatives declined to honor conservative political writer Suzanne Downing with a legislative citation, the Alaska Senate narrowly voted to allow the citation to go forward.
Hours later, the House declined to reconsider its decision, effectively killing the citation.
Downing, the founder of the website Must Read Alaska, is a controversial figure in Alaska politics. A former newspaper journalist, she turned to conservative political writing in 2016 after serving as Gov. Sean Parnell’s speechwriter and communications director of the Alaska Republican Party.
It is extraordinarily unusual for the Legislature to deny a citation, which must be proposed by at least one of the Legislature’s 60 members. Downing’s was proposed by Reps. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, and George Rauscher, R-Sutton.
On Tuesday, Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, asked to split Downing’s citation from a list awaiting senators that morning.
That vote would have been a first step toward tabling the citation, just as the House did. Instead, only eight senators joined Dunbar. Because 11 votes are needed to pass a motion in the Senate, Dunbar’s attempt failed, and the Senate approved the citation.
Dunbar said he believes the Senate’s vote against Downing’s citation failed because senators didn’t want to spend time debating it. If the House had approved the citation, he said that he believes the Senate would have voted it down instead.
Later in the day, members of the state House who support Downing attempted to bring her citation to a vote again. That procedural motion failed, with 21 votes against. 
Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, said he was disappointed by the failed vote.
“It’s really a shame that we couldn’t provide a citation for her,” he said.
Allard said she also was disappointed and felt that the vote was a little bit weaponized.
Afterward, Allard and Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, had a heated argument in the House hallways about whether it was appropriate for Downing to repost a picture of Gray’s child that had been on social media.
Speaking on the House floor, McCabe said, “Was her writing always correct? Probably not … but I will say she is an amazing person, and most of all, that lady works from sunrise to sunset.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)As a nearly 50-year advocate for the Trans Alaska Gasline, many are asking for my assessment of the current status of the project. There is no doubt we have seen momentum rise and fall over several decades but right now momentum is clearly on the rise with President Trump once again focusing on Alaska’s project.
In 2017, I and two other governors were invited to the Oval Office for Energy Week to meet with President Trump and present our respective state’s most significant energy project. Following the meeting, President Trump took me aside and asked specifically what he could do to help advance Alaska’s gasline/liquefied natural gas project. I explained the need for Asian market customers.
A few weeks later we were informed that the president of China, on his return flight from meetings with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago, would be stopping in Anchorage to meet with me. China’s first lady and the majority of his cabinet would be accompanying him. China has long been Alaska’s largest trading partner so we honored the Trump administration’s request and met with President Xi and his delegation. Reporting on that meeting the ADN noted, “Alaska exported seafood, minerals, oil and other products valued at just under $1.2 billion to China in 2016.”  The article also confirmed that expansion of these exports was discussed as well as tourism, air cargo, and Alaska’s liquified natural gas export opportunities.
That momentum continued and as reported by the Juneau Empire by fall the Trump administration asked me, the only governor invited, to join his trade mission of 29 U.S. business leaders to China. After President Trump’s invitation for more meetings in D.C., I traveled with the president and his delegation on Air Force One from D.C. as far as Hawaii for meetings. I continued on to Beijing to meet up with my Alaska team before President Trump’s arrival in Beijing. This culminated in my signing a nonbinding customer gas off take agreement in Beijing witnessed by both President Trump and President Xi.
Directly following the Beijing signing ceremony, President Trump traveled on to Vietnam and along with Vietnam President Tran Dai Quang witnessed the Nov. 12, 2017, signing of the memorandum of understanding between Petro Vietnam Gas and then Alaska Gasline Development Corp. President Keith Meyer on behalf of AGDC. These very public signing ceremonies put the Alaska LNG project on the front page of nearly every LNG journal around the world.
After these signing ceremonies some of the world’s largest energy purchasers that had not already signed nonbinding letters of intent or memorandums of understanding to purchase LNG from Alaska soon signed up. These companies included among others: Tokyo Gas, Korea Gas Corporation, ENN Energy, Petro Vietnam Gas, Mitsubishi, Chuba Elec. Power (Japan) and Sinopec.  
Our team later successfully negotiated three truly historic gas purchase sales agreements with North Slope producers British Petroleum, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips.
Unfortunately, all of this momentum faded following the 2018 gubernatorial election. The market customers that were once interested in Alaska moved on to other projects in Canada and the Lower 48 and the gas purchase sales agreements with the North Slope producers expired. Nonetheless, it is a fitting example of what project momentum can do, especially with the backing of the president of the United States.
What is often missed in the Trans Alaska Gasline project discussion is the financial benefit of Alaska’s close proximity to the Asian markets. This has been explained by the AGDC from the time of its creation in 2014 to today. Yes, many Lower 48 projects don’t require a new 800-mile gasline. However, the financial advantage of five to six days of shipping time from Alaska to the Asian market as opposed to the monthlong transits of LNG shipping from the Gulf Coast, plus the cost and uncertainty of going through the Panama Canal, must be considered.  
In 2023, while in Panama, I witnessed a long line of vessels, including LNG tankers, waiting to transit the canal. With low water, the transit was severely backed up and delayed. An auction was conducted for ships competing to move to the front of the line. One Japanese company paid $4 million above the normal transit fee to move up in the line. From Alaska it is a direct shot to Asia, a route that LNG ships used for over 40 years of on-time deliveries from Nikiski on the Kenai Peninsula.
The then president of Tokyo Gas, Japan’s largest buyer of LNG, Mr. Michiko Hirose, with whom I had met many times over the years, accepted my invitation to come to Juneau in 2018. His wife and senior advisors accompanied him and we held many meetings on Alaska’s LNG project over the course of a week. I asked Mr. Hirose about the importance of LNG price versus deliverability. He responded that price is very important but deliverability is crucial. If the best-priced LNG in the world does not show up on time, that is a huge problem for the utilities in Japan. 
This project has been delayed for so long that given the looming shortage of gas in Cook Inlet, Alaskan consumers have now become the market. Financial analysis shows that the pipeline alone can be financed, without the high compression/LNG component, to deliver gas to Alaskans at prices competitive with the cost of importing gas. Ultimately however, it is the LNG export piece that significantly reduces the cost of energy to Alaskans.
I do commend and support Governor Dunleavy’s working closely with President Trump to regain momentum for this critical energy opportunity for Alaska and beyond. It is imperative that this momentum continues to build and timelines for the start of construction and completion and first gas are met. Having the president of the United States and his administration strongly advocating for Alaska’s project could finally be the direly needed game changer to push it over the finish line.

Allbright will still face Democratic candidate Alex Braswell on Aug. 26. Braswell, a 30-year-old American Sign Language interpreter, said Tuesday night she looks forward to a clean, concise general election in August. 
“I wish Heath the best going forward,” she said. “I won’t say no to any debates until the election.”
The seat became open after former Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to take a job with Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman. The district is solidly Republican. Shedd, who won the seat in a special election in 2013, never faced opposition in any subsequent general election.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers advanced a proposal Tuesday adding new restrictions to a paid sick leave law Nebraska voters approved last year and which has yet to be implemented, moving the proposed changes to the final round of debate. 
The way the voter-approved law is written, businesses with fewer than 20 weekly employees would allow those employees to accrue up to five days’ worth of paid sick leave a year, or up to seven days a year for larger businesses. An hour of leave could be earned for every 30 hours worked. 
Employees, under the ballot measure law, can use paid sick leave for themselves or a family member for mental or physical illness, injury or a health condition or for a medical diagnosis or preventive medical care. Paid sick time also could be used during a public health emergency.
LB 415 changes
LB 415 would remove the current law’s blanket sick leave requirements, letting employers offer no paid sick leave to young teens, ages 14 and 15, or to temporary, seasonal agricultural workers and workers at the state’s smallest businesses, those with 10 or fewer employees. 
Sponsoring State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln said the proposed legislation intends to clarify and make the ballot measure “more feasible” and workable for businesses. 
His bill would clarify that businesses that meet or exceed the new law would not need to change their existing leave policies, including accrual or carryover components. It also would clarify how leave can be requested and when employees could begin to accrue sick leave.
Worker advocates and union leaders have spoken out against the proposed changes as attempts to undermine the will of Nebraska voters throughout this session.

Tuesday’s debate followed an underlying theme of the session in the officially nonpartisan but GOP-dominated statehouse of lawmakers pushing back against a handful of ballot measures passed by Nebraska voters. That push has left Democratic-aligned lawmakers in the role of defending what they call the “will of the people.” The GOP has built a 33-member supermajority that sometimes makes the filibuster less effective.
“For as long as I can remember,” State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said during the debate, “Nebraska has been doing as well as it has because you had just enough Democrats to save us from ourselves.”
Other Republican lawmakers said that they were trying to protect small businesses that could not afford paid sick leave in its voter-approved form. State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte said he had received emails from small business owners in his district about the recent ballot initiatives. 
“We do live in a capitalistic society, and we are competing for employees, but there are smaller businesses out there,” Jacobson said. “In my district, they are being strapped. They can’t continue to employ people if we’re going to raise the minimum wage, have paid sick leave.” 
GOP-led maneuver exposes supermajority’s power
Throughout the debate, lawmakers, some begrudgingly, approved an amendment that would have reduced the carve-outs to businesses with five workers instead of 10 employees, and add back in the ability to sue to enforce provisions requiring paid sick leave.
It was viewed as a compromise to get some lawmakers, including State Sen. Dave “Woody” Wordekemper of Fremont and others, to vote for LB 415. As some Democratic-aligned lawmakers continued their filibuster of the proposal after the amendment’s approval,  Republicans stopped negotiating, reconsidered the amendment and voted it down. 
Jacobson led the successful push to reconsider the amendment.

“When we cast votes here, we’re not taking away what the voters said they wanted,” Jacobson said. “We’re making it so that it will work for small businesses and for their employers.” 
Jacobson said during the debate that Republicans are willing to bringLB 415 back to select file to add an amendment that would bring some of the ability to sue back into the bill but that lowering the size of business required to pay sick leave to five is off the table. 
Democrats speaking in opposition to the changes said more than 30,000 Nebraskans would lose paid sick leave, highlighting the political reality facing the majority. 
Wordekemper said his continued support for the measure depends on the amendments proposed, if senators decide to bring LB 415 back to select file.
Wordekemper voted present on cloture for the bill this round, but the bill advanced with the support of State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, a Democrat who voted for the bill and cloture. His vote is unlikely to affect the outcome. Ballard said after the vote that he has enough votes for passage during final reading despite the compromise amendment blowing up. 
Voters adopted the paid sick leave ballot measure with nearly 75% of the vote in November, including majority support across all 49 legislative districts. The measure was heavily supported by Nebraska labor groups. The voter-approved paid sick leave law is set to go into effect on Oct. 1.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln said lawmakers should be ashamed, adding they just “told 30,000 Nebraskans that they don’t get the opportunity for paid sick leave.”
“You didn’t like the way that people were talking after that was adopted. It sounds like perhaps you decided to gut it and strip it,” Dungan said. “That’s being vindictive.”

(Photo by Russ Taylor/National Park Service)A state judge has blocked the Alaska Department of Fish and Game from conducting a controversial predator control program, ruling that the department acted “in bad faith” when it launched this season’s planned bear kills on Saturday.
Superior Court Judge Christina Rankin, in a ruling issued late Monday, granted a temporary restraining order sought by a conservation group that opposes the state’s program to cull bears in Western Alaska territory used by the ailing Mulchatna caribou herd.
Last week, Rankin ruled that a restraining order was unnecessary because the program was already legally voided by a previous court order that was still in effect. That previous order came in a March 14 ruling by Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi, who found that the program, as originally authorized by the Board of Game in 2022, violated constitutional mandates.
But two days after Rankin issued her earlier ruling, the department on Friday announced that it planned to conduct this season’s bear-removal program anyway. The department, in a press release issued late Friday, said the program authorized by the Board of Game’s March 27 emergency action was unaffected by Rankin’s ruling.
The judge, in her order Monday, said that interpretation was wrong.
The March 27 emergency regulation “is invalid and without legal effect,” she said. The state disregarded directives in both Guidi’s order and her follow-up order, demonstrating bad faith, she said.
The state’s push for the emergency regulation and its decision to move forward with the program this past weekend even though it failed to fix the court-identified problems show that “continuing predator control by any means was the goal.”
The department’s predator control program killed 175 brown bears, five black bears and 19 wolves in 2023 and 2024. The animals were killed by being shot from aircraft.
Last weekend’s activities added to the toll. Eleven brown bears and one wolf were “removed,” Ryan Scott, director of the department’s Division of Wildlife Conservation, said by email.
Rulings by Rankin and Guidi resulted from a lawsuit filed in 2023 by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance. The alliance argued that the state’s program violated constitutional requirements for public notice and input and for management of public resources in a sustainable manner. The lawsuit argued that, among other failings, the state did not analyze the impacts of Mulchatna predator control on the area’s bear population, which includes animals that roam in Katmai National Park and Preserve.
Nicole Schmitt, executive director of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, said Tuesday that it was a “big deal” that the state had been found to be acting in bad faith.
“The State got in planes and shot nearly 200 bears over the past two years,” she said by email. “When the Court found that the program was unconstitutional, we expected them to come to the table to remedy their mistakes — if the program was deemed unlawful, that means the State just poached hundreds of bears on Alaskans’ dime. Instead, they went back up in the air last weekend, in defiance of the Court’s order, to try poaching more. The Court’s most recent order is a much-needed affirmation and reminder to the Board of Game and ADFG leadership that wildlife management in Alaska is still a public process that requires at least some degree of biological sustainability.”
The state has argued that bear predation on calves is preventing recovery of the Mulchatna caribou herd. The aerial bear-culling program has thus been carried out in spring and early summer, when the caribou calves are being born.
In a statement, Alaska Department of Fish and Game Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang said state officials are “extremely disappointed” with the ruling. “This will severely reduce our ability to rebuild this herd to provide sustained subsistence hunting opportunities as required under state law,” he said.
The department has ceased the program for this year and hopes to revive it in the future, he said. “While we continue to pursue any legal options available to us, we will schedule a Board of Game meeting in accordance with the court order to get the program re-authorized,” he said.
The Mulchatna herd’s population has declined dramatically in recent decades, from about 200,000 in the 1990s to about 15,000 as of 2024, according to the Department of Fish and Game estimates. Hunting has been barred since 2021, and the department maintains that predation by bears is preventing the herd from expanding to a size that will support hunting.
The department’s goal is for the herd to grow to between 30,000 and 80,000 animals.
The state’s Mulchatna predator control program has the backing of many of the region’s subsistence hunters, and the Alaska Federation of Natives in 2023 passed a resolution supporting it.
But critics argue that the focus on bears is misplaced. They say there are other and more likely reasons for the caribou population decline, including a rapidly changing habitat. Because of climate change, there are more woody plants growing on the tundra territory, a transformation that favors moose but not lichen-eating caribou. Other factors cited as possible causes of the herd’s decline include disease and past overhunting.
In addition to the Alaska Wildlife Alliance lawsuit, a separate lawsuit challenging the program is pending in state court. That lawsuit was filed by Anchorage attorney Michelle Bittner.

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”
But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”
Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

Gavin Newsom prepares to unveil his revised budget proposal, California is experiencing unexpectedly shaky economic conditions, with a likely deficit of more than $10 billion next year.","In summary
As Gov. Gavin Newsom prepares to unveil his revised budget proposal, California is experiencing unexpectedly shaky economic conditions, with a likely deficit of more than $10 billion next year.


Facing a long horizon of budget deficits, California officials stretched and scrimped and massaged the numbers to stabilize the state’s finances last year. But an unforeseen economic downturn, spurred by President Donald Trump’s chaotic tariffs strategy, has knocked California out of fiscal balance once again.
Gov. Gavin Newsom is now forecasting a $16 billion, or 4%, decline in tax revenues in his revised budget proposal, according to a memo provided by his office in advance of the announcement Wednesday. That plan is the opening salvo in negotiations with the Legislature, ahead of the start of the fiscal year in July.
It’s a sharp turnaround from January, when Newsom projected a modest surplus in his $322 billion spending plan. The memo, which dubs the revenue shortfall the “Trump Slump,” does not provide an updated figure for California’s budget deficit.
“We are seeing the slow-rolling impact of ‘Liberation Day’ and it’s not a good one,” spokesperson H.D. Palmer said. “Conditions have definitely changed for the worse since January, in significant part because of those federal tariffs.”
California’s financial picture was troubled even before the recent turmoil. Newsom and the Legislature took extraordinary steps last summer to close a budget gap projected in the tens of billions of dollars over two years, including by making sweeping cuts to state agencies and positions, clawing back funding increases for health care providers, eliminating affordable housing programs, delaying money for schools, suspending business tax credits and dipping into reserves.
And while tax revenues came in $6.8 billion above forecast through April, other problems were brewing. 
A one-man ‘wrecking ball’ to California economy
Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for low-income people, has reported a more than $6 billion cost overrun this year — in part because an expansion to include immigrants without legal status brought in more new enrollees than expected — and it needed an emergency cash infusion in March.
The devastating fires that hit Los Angeles in January also introduced new uncertainty for the budget, because the tax deadline for Los Angeles County — where a quarter of all Californians live — was delayed until October.
But the biggest risk is undoubtedly from Trump’s tariffs, which Newsom sued last month to block. Stock market declines are poised to take a bite out of future income tax revenue, because California relies disproportionately on capital gains earned by the wealthiest taxpayers; that accounts for $10 billion of the projected revenue decline. Higher costs from the tariffs are also imperiling major sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, tourism and shipping in California, whose largest trading partner is China.
“It’s one person that is taking a wrecking ball to our economy,” state Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, a Healdsburg Democrat, said last week during an event in Sacramento. “That is the existential threat to the state of California right now.”
The grim outlook will almost certainly force more reductions to state programs, and legislative leaders will have their own ideas about what to target after Newsom puts forward his priorities today.
Bargaining will ramp up over the next month, with a June 15 deadline for the Legislature to pass a balanced budget or forgo its pay, though sometimes provisions of an overall deal drag out beyond that.

“Anyone who thinks we’re not going to make cuts this year is not in touch with reality,” Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, an Encino Democrat who leads the Assembly budget committee, told CalMatters. “Advocates who are proposing major expansions of programs should stop wasting people’s time.”
One likely exception is a proposed $420 million annual increase of California’s film and television tax credit, more than doubling the pot of available subsidies and boosting the amount that individual productions can receive. It’s a priority for Newsom, with the strong backing of many Los Angeles-area legislators, especially as the region seeks a comeback after the fires.
Trump’s effort to slash federal spending is another looming question mark. Congressional Republicans have floated shifting more of the cost of social safety net programs to the states, though they are struggling to reach a budget agreement.
If they ultimately push through major changes to federal funding, lawmakers could be back in Sacramento later this year or early next year revising the state budget once again.
“Ninety percent of the ball game is in Washington,” Gabriel said. “It’s frustrating to me that this is beyond our control.”

Dugan has been accused by federal officials of helping an undocumented immigrant escape from federal agents waiting to arrest him outside of her courtroom last month. 
The case has been cited by officials in the administration of President Donald Trump as an example of “deranged” judges working to stymie the administration’s increased immigration enforcement. Critics, including 150 judges of both political parties who wrote a letter to the Department of Justice objecting to Dugan’s arrest, have said the charges against a sitting state judge mark an escalation by the Trump administration trying to make a political point in a weak case to attack the judiciary.
Tuesday’s indictment is a normal procedural step in a criminal case but attorneys said after Dugan’s arrest late last month that it was strange that federal prosecutors hadn’t gotten a grand jury indictment prior to bringing the charges against her. Instead, U.S. attorneys filed a criminal complaint, which publicized the case immediately and allowed Dugan’s attorneys to learn the allegations against her. 
The charges stem from a routine court appearance in April by Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. While he was in the courtroom, agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the FBI and DEA arrived with an administrative warrant to arrest Flores-Ruiz. 
That warrant, which was not signed by a judge, did not give agents the authority to enter the courtroom. The agents waited in the hallway outside. Dugan directed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out a side door of the room that exited into the same hallway. The agents saw him leave the room and one rode down the elevator with him before he was arrested later on the street. 
Dugan has been temporarily removed from her seat on the Milwaukee County Circuit Court by the Wisconsin Supreme Court while the charges are pending, but after the indictment, her attorneys said in a statement she’ll fight the charges. 
“Judge Dugan asserts her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court.” 
Dugan is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday morning.

They argued the state Department of Environmental Protection overstepped its authority and violated the constitution by imposing an impermissible tax on electricity generators who release climate-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s Department of Environmental Protection says that’s not the case, because lawmakers decades ago gave it broad authority to control air pollution. Its lawyer, Thomas Hazlett, argued before the court that requiring power producers to pay for allowances to release climate-warming carbon dioxide is within that authority.
“The policy choice that the legislature made and the duty that it imposed … is to prevent, control, reduce and abate air pollution,” Hazlett said. “Carbon dioxide is an air pollutant.”
Environmental groups argued the state constitution guarantees the protection of public resources including clean air and that the DEP’s plan to limit carbon emissions is constitutional because it is part of its program to protect the public’s environmental rights.
“Air is a public trust resource, and the department and other trustees have to act to protect it,” Jessica O’Neil, who represented Penn Future, the Sierra Club, the Clean Air Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Brigid Landy Khuri, representing Senate Republican Leader Joe Pittman, President Pro Tempore Kim Ward and Energy Committee Chairman Gen Yaw, said the agency  overstepped its authority by joining 11 other northeast states in the carbon credit exchange.
“If the purpose is just to cap and regulate CO₂, that’s one thing,” Khuri said. “If the purpose is … to change the entire dynamic of our electric generation system, that’s absolutely a policy decision that must be made in the General Assembly, that was not made here.”
Pennsylvania joined the program, known as RGGI, in 2022 under Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration. 
RGGI requires power plant operators to bid for the rights to emit quantities of carbon dioxide as a byproduct of burning coal, oil and natural gas to make electricity. It’s designed to reduce emissions by gradually decreasing the number of credits over several years and investing the auction proceeds in energy efficiency and clean energy technologies in each state.
In more than two hours of arguments the justices questioned the extent to which the DEP can regulate other sources of greenhouse gas emissions from cars, or even cows. 
But the main question before the court was whether the lower Commonwealth Court incorrectly determined the requirement to buy carbon credits was an illegal tax. 
In its 2023 decision, the appellate court said that Pennsylvania’s participation in RGGI must be approved through the General Assembly and that the Department of Environmental Protection does not have the authority to impose a tax.
Hazlett said the DEP contends that the requirement to purchase carbon credits is actually a fee, but the justices asked whether there is a third option. 
Justice David Wecht suggested the creation of a marketplace for carbon credits is more like the state is selling a product or an asset.
“It’s like environmental Bitcoin,” Wecht said, noting that the credits are different from licenses for which the DEP charges fees because they can be sold on a secondary market.
“What authority does DEP have to create a product that the General Assembly has not authorized them to create … and then reap the profits from the sales, whatever they may be, along with its brothers and sister states who agree to enter into this conglomerate?” Wecht asked. 
The legislature created the authority for the DEP to regulate the burning of fossil fuels and the emission of pollutants in the Air Pollution Control Act, which was first passed in 1959. The sale of carbon credits was determined to be an efficient way to exercise that authority, Hazlett said.

He added that controlling industrial emissions with credits that can be traded has been around since the 1980s, when the state sought to control acid rain emissions. Hazlett said the intent of the program is not to put the fossil fuel industry out of business.
“The idea of the regulatory regime is to allow the regulated entities to manage their business in the most efficient way,” Hazlett said, noting that generators could reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by improving technology or using other fuels.
David Fine, who represents a consortium of generating companies that use fossil fuels, said the case before the court is not about whether RGGI is a good program, but rather, whether the executive branch has the authority to implement such a program.
Responding to the court’s inquiry about how much RGGI would generate in auction proceeds, Fine said that based on an auction for the other states last year, Pennsylvania would have received $2 billion in costs that electricity producers would pass on to consumers. He argued the court should conclude a cost of that magnitude should not be implemented without legislative approval.
“That’s multiple times the entire DEP budget,” Fine said. “All of that without the General Assembly voted in favor of it. This will cripple an industry. This will imperil jobs, and it will also imperil investment in Pennsylvania business.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image002-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-13 20:59:34.680613

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)More than half of Rhode Island state government’s IT workforce are contractors, Department of Administration (DOA) Director Jonathan Womer told the Senate Committee on Finance during a hearing on Tuesday afternoon. 
“That’s not an ideal situation,” Womer said.
Now Rhode Island’s state IT department thinks it’s time for a little spring cleaning: It’s asking the General Assembly to approve 15 new full-time hires for fiscal year 2026 to replace contractors with in-house talent.
Womer appeared before the Senate committee to testify on budget amendment #10 from Gov. Dan McKee that would add the 15 positions to the DOA’s technology arm, the Division of Enterprise Technology Strategy and Services (ETSS). 
The request is budget-neutral, Womer said, as an internal service fund would subsidize the new hires. Rather than draw from general revenue, the Information Technology Internal Service Fund grows from billing other state agencies for IT services they use. A complementary budget amendment #9 details how state agencies are charged for enterprise technology, with leftover project funds going into a restricted receipt account. 
“We’re not asking for any more money for this,” Womer said. “We’re going to make sure absolutely that this pays for itself.” 
Womer added his agency looked inward when servers holding the state’s public benefits eligibility system were breached last December, compromising and leaking the personal information of an estimated 657,000 Rhode Islanders. The system, RIBridges, was built and continues to be maintained by state contractor Deloitte, which never sent a representative to any of McKee’s numerous press conferences about the breach.  
“One of the many things we did when we looked at the RIBridges incident was take a look at institutional and strategic things that we could change to make our IT system stronger,” Womer said, “and one of those we looked at pretty heavily is making more of our IT personnel state employees.”
Brian Tardiff, the state’s chief digital officer and head of the enterprise technology division, testified beside Womer, describing an IT agency whose reliance on contractors goes well beyond the spectacular example of the RIBridges breach.
There are 382 IT personnel who work for the state right now, Tardiff said. Of the 193 contractors, only 40 are working short-term assignments that will end when their contracts do. The remaining 153 workers provide daily operational support — something the state wants to bring in-house.  










We’re not asking for any more money for this. We’re going to make sure absolutely that this pays for itself. Department of Administration (DOA) Director Jonathan Womer 


“The remaining balance is on full time to support normal IT operations in critical leadership roles and critical functional areas,” Tardiff said. “Compounding our challenge, within the next 48 months, we’re looking at a 33% attrition rate through retirement of the workforce.”
That’s why the state needs “the agility to produce job classifications that represent a modern workforce,” Tardiff said. McKee’s budget amendment would achieve that by stripping away some usual formalities involved in the state hiring process, including public hearings and other rounds of approval needed to change job classifications and pay scales. Womer explained that revising a job description can take up to nine months.  
“Sometimes nine months in the IT world, things have changed completely,” Womer said.
Topping Tardiff’s wishlist for his department are an RIBridges technical lead, a security analyst, and project delivery management to improve coordination of major IT initiatives across agencies.
Tardiff told lawmakers the average cost of a contractor is $260,000 to $280,000 per year, while the proposed full-time staff would cost around $240,000, including benefits. Ideally, some contractors could be brought in-house, which would also enlarge the state’s pension fund, Tardiff said.

A ‘refreshing’ ask
Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski called the pivot from contracted labor “refreshing.”
“Sometimes I feel like it’s a sense of déjà vu, because I could remember years ago in the Finance Committee, how we were told it was the best thing to have contractors and so forth versus employees,” Sosnowksi said.
Freshman Cranston Democratic Sen. Lammis Vargas was so eager to ask about the 15 IT hires that she mistakenly directed her question at the afternoon’s first presenter Richard Charest, head of the Executive Office of Health and Human Services. 
Charest answered anyway: “I’d love to have 15 FTEs,” he said with a smile, drawing laughter from the audience and committee alike. 
Once Tardiff and Womer sat down, Vargas picked up where she left off, and questioned Tardiff about high turnover in the department. Only 172 of 189 state IT positions are filled, Tardiff said, and despite actively recruiting for eight more hires, turnover is constant, with the number of vacant slots mercurial.  
“That number fluctuates almost monthly,” Tardiff said. “Last month it was five. I had three personnel retire this month. So now it’s eight.”
“Might be tough for you to answer, but how long do you foresee filling these in?” Vargas asked.
“There’s always going to be five or six [vacancies] for that volume of personnel,” Womer replied. “We’ll have that number of vacancies at any given point in time…We thought we could successfully do 15 in the next fiscal year, which is the reason we only asked for 15.”
Vargas was also concerned that the request is not genuinely cost neutral.
“With the contractors, we’re not paying health insurance,” Vargas said. 
Womer acknowledged there might be individual differences in pay rates for individual contractors, adding retention over time could complicate compensation for future years. But he was firm that the measure will pay for itself. 
Chair Lou DiPalma replied playfully to Vargas, “Senator, we’re not giving them any more money.”

A review from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor looked into how the city and Unity of Greater New Orleans spent more than $216 million in public money was spent on homeless initiatives between January 2019 and June 2024. One obstacle in measuring the effectiveness of Unity’s performance was the nonprofit’s resistance to producing detailed data and records the auditor requested.
“What we know is what programs, generally, the buckets of programs that were spent in,” Chris Magee, performance audit manager with the Legislative Auditor said. “And we were able to see which providers receive those funds. But what we weren’t able to do is take it that next step.”
For example, Unity reported spending $122.4 million on permanent housing programs, but it provided no details on how many people were placed in permanent homes.
Unity said it can’t share detailed information because its not allowed under privacy laws and rules of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the source of the public money provided to New Orleans for its homelessness services.
The Legislative Auditor issued subpoenas for the data, but Unity and other advocates for the  homeless have asked a judge to block that request. The case is ongoing.
State Rep. Alonzo Knox, D-New Orleans, said he expects greater transparency from an organization given public dollars to provide a critical service in the city.
“When residents drive across the city and they see sprawling encampments, they don’t see $200 million being spent, I can assure you,” Knox said. “It raises red flags for me. And I think it’s fair that it would raise red flags for anyone.
“We can’t continue as we have for decades, just shelling out money to a nonprofit without any accountability. I’m disappointed in the fact that, given where we are today, that they are not more transparent.”

(Photo by Jason Cameron/Getty Images)Utah officials say they want to expand an airport, widen roads, and build new reservoirs and other water infrastructure on the federal land that Utah Rep. Celeste Maloy is proposing to sell to local governments in Washington and Beaver counties. 
Maloy says the proposed disposal of nearly 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land will help the region cope with rapid population growth while generating revenue for the federal government — environmental advocates worry that the proposal has too few guidelines, and is a slippery slope that will ultimately anger voters. 
Maloy, along with Nevada GOP Rep. Mark Amodei, added the proposal as an amendment to the House budget reconciliation package, which ultimately passed during a late-night House Natural Resources Committee meeting on May 6. 
Amodei outrages NV congressional colleagues with ‘dead of night’ federal land sales amendment

“Not all federal lands have the same value. Some should not be available for disposal. We all agree on that,” Maloy said during the committee meeting, telling lawmakers that the land disposal will help St. George and Washington County — one of the fastest growing areas in the entire U.S. — meet the water, housing and transportation needs for its ballooning population. 
“The net impact will be to reduce the federal debt and deficit through fair market value sales of targeted lands needed by local governments for infrastructure. And the impact will be to a third of a percentage of the federal land in the state,” Maloy said. 
That reasoning doesn’t fly with some of the state’s public land and environmental advocates, like Steve Bloch with the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. 
“Shame on Celeste Malloy for trying this,” said Bloch, legal director for the alliance. “When you think about how Congress works, at least in concept, this eleventh hour effort by Reps. Maloy and Amadei really stands in stark contrast. They introduce this in the middle of the night at the end of a long day of a budget reconciliation hearing for a reason — the sale of federal public lands is wildly unpopular.”

Most of the land earmarked for disposal, about 450,000 acres, is in Nevada. In Utah, Maloy designated about 11,500 acres of land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, in the southwestern part of the state. The land would be sold to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George.
If the legislation goes into law, the land will be disposed of within 180 days, sold to the governments for “not less than fair market value.” According to the bill text, that money will be deposited into the federal government’s general fund. 
Per the amendment, here’s how much land could be disposed of: 

Washington County stands to gain the most land, with 23 parcels covering about 6,492 acres. Maloy’s amendment divides the sale into two sections — the east half, with 16 parcels totalling about 4,959 acres, and the west half, with seven parcels amounting to roughly 1,533 acres. 
The Washington County Water Conservancy District would be allowed to purchase 22 parcels amounting to about 4,375 acres.
St. George would be allowed to purchase 23 parcels amounting to about 520 acres.
Beaver County could get three parcels amounting to roughly 62 acres.

According to these entities, the land is slated for a variety of uses, like water projects, public infrastructure, housing, recreation and an airport expansion. Although the amendment was proposed during a late-night vote last week, the plans have been in motion for months — maps of the parcels in question, titled “prepared at the request of Rep. Celeste Maloy,” are dated as early as March 8. 
In St. George, a 203-acre parcel in the southeast corner of the city would be used for an airport expansion; a 105-acre parcel near Santa Clara would be used to build the Graveyard Reservoir and Dam; a 9.5-acre parcel off of Curly Hollow Drive in the southwest would be used for housing; several roads could be expanded or widened; an arsenic treatment plant owned by the city currently sits on a 4.8-acre parcel of federal land marked for disposal; a handful of 1-acre parcels would be used to protect well sites.

“We thank Representative Celeste Maloy for introducing an amendment to a bill that would assist the City of St. George in securing properties that will be critical to our water infrastructure needs in the future,” the city said in a statement. 
For the Washington County Water Conservancy District, there’s a 418-acre parcel that will house the Chief Toquer Reservoir north of La Verkin, which according to the district could hold 3,638 acre-feet of water and is already under construction. Another 3,100-acre parcel — the largest of all 70 parcels identified in the proposal — will be used for a future water storage site near the town of Hurricane. At least three parcels totalling nearly 600 acres will be used for water treatment, and another 48 acres over four parcels used for water tanks. The district also says a number of the parcels will be used to build, or access existing, water pipelines. 
In Washington County, a number of the parcels are adjacent to existing roads — there’s a 487-acre parcel alongside Old Highway 91, which spans about 11 miles from the Arizona border north to the Paiute Indian Reservation; a 338-acre parcel that runs along state Route 18 north of St. George; and a 330-acre parcel that borders Interstate 15 north of Toquerville. 
Also included in the amendment is a 311-acre parcel bordering Zion National Park, near the gateway town of Rockville. Representatives from the county told KUER that the parcel would be used for recreation, including mountain bike trails. Other parcels would be used to build and expand existing roads.
Some environmental groups pointed out that several parcels line up with the proposed pathway and land identified for the Lake Powell Pipeline, a controversial project years in the making that would divert water from the Colorado River to Washington County to support its rapid growth.  
The project has yet to clear several federal hurdles, and needs a new environmental impact statement — officials in the area say the project is no longer a priority. Plus, it faces opposition from other states in the Colorado River basin, with Colorado, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada and Wyoming threatening to sue Utah over concerns the pipeline could compromise ongoing agreements on the river. 
“The pipeline is not just a fantasy,” said Zach Frankel, executive director of the Utah Rivers Council. “I think this is for the Lake Powell Pipeline, they just won’t admit it.”
Maloy’s office denied the allegation, as did the Washington County Water Conservancy District, which pointed to a detailed list of intended uses for the proposed land disposal. 
Zinke forms bipartisan Public Lands Caucus

Still, the lack of a mandate in Maloy’s amendment has public land and environmental advocates worried. Maloy’s office and the governments who intend to purchase the land say it will be used for specific purposes, but not everyone buys it. 
“The water district could turn that land into a real estate development, and we, the public, have no ability to influence that decision because it is a non-democratic entity,” said Frankel, telling Utah News Dispatch “I have to presume that this is the first of many such bills.” 
“There’s no requirement. There’s no directive, full stop,” added Bloch with the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. “Just look at where these tracks are … These are very intentionally chosen to do things like facilitate further growth.”
Bloch cautioned politicians against proposing similar legislation in the future. Polling has routinely shown that voters in Utah, and across the West, oppose the sale of public lands, regardless of political party. Rep. Ryan Zinke, a Republican from Montana who recently formed the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus, said he believes the sale should be stripped from the reconciliation bill. 
“They’re thinking about these (parcels) as assets to be bought, sold. It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal lands,” said Bloch. “The future of public lands is a third rail for politics in the West, meaning that you mess with them at your own peril.”

There’s no reason why money for road repairs and flood protections should hinge upon states’ cooperation with federal immigration policies, contend 20 Democratic states attorneys general.
That’s why the AGs, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, are asking a federal judge to stop federal agencies from a “grant funding hostage scheme” that requires detaining undocumented immigrants who don’t commit crimes in order to receive key federal grants and aid.
Two new federal lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) aim to protect and preserve billions of federal dollars already awarded to states for emergency preparedness, disaster relief and infrastructure projects.
Directives issued in April by DHS and DOT secretaries informed states that their federal funding required compliance with federal immigration policies. The AGs — representing Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Vermont — allege this violated constitutional protections for separation of powers.
“By hanging a halt in this critical funding over States like a sword of Damocles, Defendants impose immense harm on States, forcing them to choose between readiness for disasters and emergencies, on the one hand, and their judgment about how best to investigate and prosecute crimes, on the other,” the lawsuit against DHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Coast Guard, and their leaders, states.
“Defendants’ grant funding hostage scheme violates two key principles that underlie the American system of checks and balances: agencies in the Executive Branch cannot act contrary to the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government cannot use the spending power to coerce States into adopting its preferred policies. Defendants have ignored both principles, claiming undelegated power to place their own conditions on dozens of grant programs that Congress created and bulldozing through the Constitution’s boundary between state and federal authority.”
The AGs say state and local public safety officials have more important work to do than cater to the whims of a new administration, which stand in contradiction to state-level directives like, for example, authorizing licenses for undocumented immigrants. Rhode Island lawmakers granted driving privileges for undocumented residents in 2022, with a July, 1 2023 effective date, joining 19 other states and D.C.
Federal protocols followed by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies could force state and local police to use state license laws as a way to find and detain undocumented immigrants.
“As a former U.S. Attorney and former federal prosecutor, I know how many ICE agents are in Rhode Island and it’s under 10,” Neronha said during a virtual press conference Tuesday. “What they need in order to carry out their agenda is for us to do the work for them, pulling us away from important law enforcement work in Rhode Island.”

 More uncertainty for Washington Bridge

No state has seen federal funding cut off since directives were issued by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Not yet.
States’ abilities to respond to natural disasters and security threats, and complete key infrastructure projects, including the much-anticipated rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge in Rhode Island, hinge upon a continued flow of congressionally authorized federal grants and aid.
The $221 million Biden-era infrastructure grant awarded to Rhode Island for the Washington Bridge project only became accessible in late March, after weeks of uncertainty in the wake of the administration change. Gov. Dan McKee’s office and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday regarding continued access to the funds in the wake of Duffy’s April 24 directive tying federal infrastructure grants to compliance with federal diversity and immigration policies.
The Duffy directive fails to provide any statutory or legal explanation for why transportation funding relates to immigration enforcement. The new requirements  jeopardize more than $628 million in federal funding in Rhode Island, and billions of dollars more across the country, the AGs argue in their lawsuit against Duffy and DOT.
“If Plaintiff States reject Defendants’ unlawful Immigration Enforcement Condition, they will collectively lose billions in federal funding that is essential to sustain critical public safety and transportation programs, including highway development, airport safety projects, protections against train collisions, and programs to prevent injuries and deaths from traffic accidents. The loss of this funding will cause state and local providers to scale back or even terminate many of these programs and projects,” the complaint states. “More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States.”










More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States.


– 20 state Democratic AGs in lawsuit against U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy


Similarly dire predictions accompany the loss of security and disaster funds, which includes $3 billion in FEMA money to states each year, according to the lawsuit against DHS. Rhode Island received more than $45 million in FEMA grants in 2024 alone, according to the lawsuit.

The new complaints reprise language of the 20 state AG lawsuits against the Trump administration that preceded them, calling the executive agencies’ actions “arbitrary and capricious” and in clear violation of constitutional separation of powers and spending clauses.
Neronha during the press conference pointed to the success that AGs have had in other lawsuits, temporarily preserving funding and policy protections for education, immigration, research funding, public health, and grants and aid to state governments, among others.
Not that he expects the frenzy of legal activity will abate anytime soon.
“As we stack wins against the Trump administration for violation of the Constitution and other federal laws, what we are seeing is a creeping authoritarianism in this country,” Neronha said. “The president is trying to take power for himself. He’s trying to sideline Congress, and now, he’s attempting to undermine the judiciary.”
Neronha likened the latest federal directives attempting to force states to redirect their own law enforcement to serve federal civil immigration policies to “holding a gun to states’ heads.”
Rhode Island, home to four of the 20 federal lawsuits against the Trump administration already, was again picked as the setting for the latest complaints due to the “strong team” within Neronha’s office, he said.
Neronha and other AGs bringing the two cases against the administration also stressed the sum of their collaborative parts.
“We’ve built the best and biggest law firm in the country, and we’re fighting for all Americans,” Neronha said.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
The lawsuit against DOT was assigned to U.S. District Chief Judge John Jr. McConnell Jr., while the case against DHS was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith, according to the public court docket.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Senate on Tuesday sent back to the House a bill to implement work requirements for the Medicaid program, although the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services has already requested a waiver from the federal government to implement similar requirements.
There are some differences between Senate File 615 and the waiver request announced by Gov. Kim Reynolds in April. The legislative proposal would require people who receive health coverage through Iowa Health and Wellness Plan (IHAWP), the Medicaid coverage available for low-income, able-bodied adults from ages 19 to 64, to work at least 80 hours each month to stay in the program.
The HHS proposal sets a higher work requirement of 100 hours per month, and includes other means to retain IHAWP coverage, such as being enrolled in education or job skills programs, or earning the equivalent in wages to working 100 hours a month at $7.25 per hour. Both versions of the proposal contain exceptions for certain groups, including people with disabilities, individuals who are in a substance abuse treatment program for up to six months, and those with children under age 6.
While the legislative proposal has a lower monthly work requirement, it also contains a provision that would end the IHAWP program entirely if work requirements are ever approved by the federal government and later revoked. Iowa HHS would be directed to discontinue the expanded Medicaid program if federal law or regulations are changed to exclude work requirements in the future — contingent on the federal government having previously approved Iowa’s implementation of these restrictions.
Ending IHAWP would be subject to federal approval. If ending the program is not allowed, the state department would be directed to implement an alternative plan.
Both the Senate and House have approved this measure, but the House had sent the legislation back to the Senate with an amendment clarifying the language calling for the discontinuation of IHAWP if the federal government revokes work requirement approval, in addition to adding a requirement for HHS to conduct and submit a report to lawmakers on the Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities (MEPD) program by Dec. 15, 2025 — before the 2026 legislative session. The Senate amended the House’s change to remove the language calling for a MEPD report.
Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, said the report was unnecessary as conversations on this topic will occur “on a voluntary basis” before the legislature reconvenes in 2026.
Democrats criticized the measure, which they said will remove, due to reporting requirements, low-income people who are working and are in need of health coverage. Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, compared the feedback lawmakers received at the subcommittee meetings discussing IHAWP work requirements to the subcommittee held on the “Work Without Worry” legislation that proposed removing Medicaid income and asset limits for Iowans with disabilities.
While advocates and Iowans who attended at the “Work Without Worry” bill subcommittee praised the measure for allowing them to return to the workforce without risking the loss of health coverage, people at the subcommittee meeting for the bill setting Medicaid work requirements overwhelmingly spoke against the proposal.
“Everyone who was a local Iowan showing up on behalf of folks with disabilities, children, pregnant mothers, just folks in the population who are low income and struggling — trying so hard to make ends meet — they said this bill will hurt Iowans,” Trone Garriott said. “It will push people off of their health care. In other states where it’s been implemented, legislation like this has just made it harder for people who do qualify to actually get the paperwork done and stay on.”
While supporters have said work requirements will help reduce the costs of Medicaid, Trone Garriott said other states that have implemented similar work requirements have not seen significant savings, and that these requirements will raise overall health care costs in the state because it will cause more people to be uninsured.
“We have a growing number of people who are uninsured when measures like this are enacted, and those folks end up seeking charity care at emergency rooms and hospitals,” she said. “Charity care is not free. A health care provider needs to spread out the cost, shift those costs on the other folks in order to keep paying the bills and keeping their doors open. It raises costs on everyone when folks are not insured.”
Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner also said the legislature is moving forward with this measure “without having any firm idea what the fiscal impact will be.” The Legislative Services Agency fiscal notes on the bill stated the nonpartisan agency did not receive responses to multiple requests for information from HHS about the financial impact of implementing work requirements.
Klimesh said HHS has included fiscal impact estimates in its waiver request over a demonstration period of five years that have found a cumulative savings of $50 million for the state, and held public hearings on the proposal, a part of the process of seeking approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Klimesh also pointed to movement by the U.S. Congressional Committee on Energy and Commerce to make federal changes to Medicaid which includes requirements for able-bodied people between ages 19 to 65 to work, attend educational programs or participate in community service for at least 80 hours a month to stay eligible for coverage.
“Essentially, if you look at the blueprints the federal government is utilizing, it almost lines up specifically with what the state’s requirements are,” Klimesh said.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capitol Dispatch) State representatives approved a budget from the Senate on Tuesday that would increase funding for agriculture and natural resources departments by $682,000 compared to the current fiscal year.
The budget for the upcoming 2025-26 fiscal year prioritizes funding to prevent the spread of foreign animal disease, supports state park maintenance and continues the Choose Iowa program, along with operations for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
Senate File 646 would appropriate $46.6 million from the general fund and appropriate an additional $99.4 million from other funds for fiscal year 2026. 
The bill would put $1.8 million into the Choose Iowa fund for use on promotion, dairy innovation and value-added grants for Choose Iowa participants, which is on par with 2025 expected figures for the program.

Choose Iowa is a network of producers selling Iowa-grown goods and has nearly 300 members across the state. 
The bill also ends the Choose Iowa pilot purchasing program and creates the Choose Iowa Food Purchasing Program, with an appropriation of $200,000 to help food banks purchase locally produced foods. 
The pilot program previously had two divisions, one that helped local food banks and another that helped Iowa schools purchase from local growers. 
Local farmers and food-security advocates hoped the program would have substantial funding this year following the cancellation of funding from a similar federal program. Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, proposed an amendment to expand the purchasing program to include schools, but the House did not adopt the amendment. 
Scholten said the amendment would have made “sure that (Iowa) kids are properly fed.” 
The appropriations bill would also eliminate the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Fund in favor of creating an Iowa Animal Disease Prevention fund, which fulfills requests from Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig and other stakeholders for increased funds to protect against the threat of foreign animal diseases. 
Those funds would go toward animal disease equipment, vaccine research and updates to state technology to track an outbreak. 
Rep. Norlin Mommsen, R-DeWitt, tied the need for funding to the ongoing impact of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which since 2022 has killed more than 169 million birds in the United States.
The bill also appropriates $200,000 to the Iowa Geological Survey to research and map the state’s aquifers. 
The bill allocates $12 million from the Environment First Fund, in lieu of a standing $20 million appropriation from the general fund, to extend the Resources Enhancement and Protection, or REAP, program through 2028. This program funds county conservation, city parks and open spaces, historic preservation, conservation education, soil and water enhancement, and other projects related to natural resources. 
Rep. Monica Kurth, D-Davenport, proposed an amendment, which failed, to fund the project at the full $20 million. “It’s a long time program that has never received the full amount of money for which it was authorized,” Kurth said. 
The bill also has a special general fund appropriation for state park maintenance, floodplain management and forestry health management. 
The budget bill faced some pushback from Democrats in both the House and Senate who said it did not adequately prioritize local food, water quality and conservation efforts.
The bill advanced from both chambers, and with no adopted amendments in the House it now goes to the governor for final approval.

Lawyers for Jonah Bevin, the adopted son of former Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, have filed a sharply worded reply to claims Matt Bevin filed under seal April 25 in which he responds to “certain assertions” made by his estranged son.
In a response Tuesday, Dawn J. Post, a lawyer and child advocate representing Jonah, disputes assertions that Matt and Glenna Bevin — who are now divorced — spent “significant resources” on care for the youth they adopted around age 5 from Ethiopia.
In reality, most money was spent on a series of out-of-state residential facilities for Jonah, starting at age 13, culminating in his abandonment at age 17 at  the Atlantis Leadership Academy, a brutally violent youth facility in Jamaica that was shut down by child welfare authorities in 2024, Post said in a 10-page affidavit.
“The Bevins paid for pain, not protection,” Post’s affidavit said. “Jonah’s harm stemmed from the decisions of those responsible for his well-being, not his own actions.”
While Matt Bevin portrays Jonah as a “troubled teen,” Post responds his behavior and emotional well-being were worsened by harsh and sometimes abusive facilities, most of all the Jamaican facility where youths allege brutal beatings and treatment that amounted to torture.
Matt Bevin claims to have filed his affidavit under seal “due to the sensitive nature of the content,” lawyer John H. Helmers, who also represents Jonah, said in a filing Tuesday that accompanies Post’s affidavit. Their filing is public.
The Bevins did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Former KY Gov. Matt Bevin’s adopted son reportedly removed from abusive facility in Jamaica

The filing comes in the midst of a court battle between Jonah and his adoptive parents over the son’s claims of abuse and neglect and allegations the couple abandoned him in Jamaica.
As part of the case, Jonah has obtained protective orders against Matt and Glenna Bevin, barring them from direct contact with him, in part because he alleged they tried to get him out of the country this year on a hastily arranged trip to Ethiopia. The Bevins claimed to have located Jonah’s birth mother they had previously told him was deceased, according to court records.
Jonah  has since said in a court filing he believes “they were trying to get me to disappear.”
‘A critical inconsistency’
Matt Bevin, in his affidavit, said during a period in October 2023 when he was living with the Bevins, Jonah was charged with assaulting and threatening to kill a family member. Post’s affidavit said Jonah has never denied the incident, an apparent altercation with his father, and entered a diversion program under court supervision in Jefferson County to resolve the charges.
But the event highlights a “critical inconsistency,” Post’s affidavit said. It says Jonah — while supposedly under court supervision, was removed in late 2023 at age 17 and sent out of the country to Jamaica with no notice to the court or family court judge who was then presiding over the Bevins’ divorce case, including oversight of their minor children.
“Why was this court never informed of his removal and custodial status at that time?” it asks.
Post’s affidavit also provides the first detailed account in the court record of Jonah’s alleged abandonment in Jamaica by the Bevins and their refusal to intervene on his behalf after he was removed from the Jamaica facility along with six other youths by child welfare officials.
Matt Bevin alleges he worked on Jonah’s behalf  but Post, in her affidavit said “Matt Bevin did the exact opposite and Glenna Bevin did not intervene on Jonah’s behalf.”
Instead, she said, through her involvement in the court case she learned Matt Bevin was seeking to keep Jonah in Jamaica.
‘I don’t have anybody’: Adoptive teen son of a KY governor talks about life on his own

Post said, she, as a child advocate, spent three weeks in Jamaica in 2024 working on behalf of the youths removed from the facility, including Jonah, and said the Bevins were only parents who did not “engage” with the U.S. embassy or Jamaican child welfare authorities to assist in his care and return to the United States. The case attracted international media attention after hotel heiress and celebrity Paris Hilton — an advocate for children in the so-called “troubled teen” industry — flew to Jamaica to aid the youths.
At a court hearing in Jamaica, the defense lawyer for the Atlantis Academy — whose employees are facing abuse charges in Jamaica — claimed he had been retained by the Bevins to speak on Jonah’s behalf and argued for the facility to be reopened and Jonah returned to it, Post’s affidavit said.
Post described Jonah as “noticeably withdrawn” and said he told her he was aware his family did not want him back.
As a result, Jonah was placed in custody of the Jamaican child welfare system while Post and various authorities in that country and the United States tried to work out a placement in the United States, settling on a provider in Florida.
Officials needed approval of Jonah’s parents, but were unable to reach them to obtain their assistance, the affidavit said. 
Matt Bevin ‘tricky’
Post, in her affidavit, said she then called Glenna Bevin herself. In a recorded call, Glenna Bevin told her she agreed with the plan but she and Matt Bevin disagreed. She said she would try to reach her then-husband but warned he could be “tricky” and that he “doesn’t always respond” to attempts to contact him.
Glenna Bevin also asked Post to share her contact information with officials because “Matt Bevin had allegedly left her out of Jonah’s care and protection.”

Jonah Bevin returned to the United States in May 2024, three months after he was removed from the Jamaican facility, after officials with the U.S. embassy obtained the Bevins’ consent, Post’s affidavit said.
“I worked for weeks with Jamaican and U.S. Embassy authorities to arrange and pay for Jonah’s return flight to the United States on which he was accompanied by a U.S. State Department representative,” Post’s affidavit said. 
His return came “despite the work of the Bevins to keep him in Jamaica” and “at no cost to the Bevins,” it said.
Post’s affidavit said Jonah remains traumatized by the events and, since legal proceedings began earlier this year, underwent a comprehensive evaluation at a Child Advocacy Center of his physical and emotional health. 
“The Bevins have never initiated an inquiry into the long-term impact of the trauma Jonah suffered while in their care, nor have they ever asked him about the continuing effects of the abuse and neglect,” Post’s affidavit said.
“There has been no meaningful effort to address the harm Jonah suffered both in Jamaica and in prior placements,” it said.
Awaiting a ruling
Jonah turned 18 last November after returning to the United States from Jamaica but has questioned in a court filing whether that birth date is accurate, citing a recently obtained adoption document that shows a different birth day, which would make him just 17.
Meanwhile, Jonah is still awaiting a ruling from Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela Johnson on his request to intervene in the case to protect his interests. He has said he is living on his own without support from the Bevins and spent his 18th birthday in a homeless shelter.
Jonah and the Courier Journal have both objected to the Bevins’ request that their proposed divorce settlement, which the judge must review, be kept confidential.
Following a hearing last month, Judge Johnson said she hopes to rule as soon as possible.

SPRINGFIELD — State officials are on track to shut down a program at the end of June that provides publicly funded health care coverage to more than 30,000 non-U.S. citizens in Illinois, including many who are in the country without legal authorization.

A legislative oversight committee took no action Tuesday on a set of administrative rules the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services adopted in March that will end the program, effective July 1 — the first day of the next fiscal year.

Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, cochair of the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, said the lack of action Tuesday means nothing has changed about the plans to bring the program to an end.

“It (the rule) is in place now. It’s phasing out. JCAR hasn’t taken any action on it,” Cunningham said in an interview after Tuesday’s meeting. “I don’t think there’s anything to read into it beyond that.”

The Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults program, or HBIA, was launched in 2021. It covers qualifying individuals aged 42-64. The program came about as a companion to a program that began the year before, Health Benefits for Immigrant Seniors, or HBIS, which covers about 8,900 individuals aged 65 and over.

Both programs were intended to provide health coverage to a segment of the population that was ineligible for coverage under Medicaid solely because of their immigration status. The programs cover those who are not lawfully present in the United States as well as legal permanent residents who have not been in the country long enough to receive Medicaid benefits.

However, the two programs have far exceeded their original cost estimates. According to an auditor general’s report released in February, the total cost of both programs from Fiscal Year 2021 through Fiscal Year 2024 was more than $1.6 billion.

And because the programs cover individuals who are not eligible for traditional Medicaid – the public health insurance program for low-income individuals that is jointly funded with state and federal funds – nearly all the cost of those programs came exclusively from state dollars.

With the state facing flattening revenues and a projected budget deficit in the coming fiscal year, Gov. JB Pritzker proposed ending the HBIA program effective July 1.

A notice on the program’s web page reads: “Due to State Fiscal Year 2026 budgetary constraints, the state had to make the difficult decision to use the limited funding available to continue coverage for eligible noncitizens aged 65+ only.”

In proposing to end the program, Pritzker noted  the working-age adults that it covers can get jobs with employer-sponsored health benefits.

The General Assembly’s revenue estimating group, the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability, recently increased its revenue estimate over its previous March projection by about $266 million. But COGFA’s latest forecast is still $471 million below the governor’s February projection for baseline revenues, and Pritzker has not backed down from his call for ending the HBIA program.

Andy Manar, his deputy governor for budget issues, was quoted in the Chicago Tribune as saying as recently as last week that Pritzker remains “firm” in his decision to cut the program, noting that cuts had to be made in many state programs to balance next year’s budget.

But as lawmakers continue working to pass a final budget before the end of May, Congress is considering other changes to the Medicaid program that could have an even more profound impact on the state budget.

The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare and Medicaid, began hearings Tuesday on a package of spending recommendations that the Congressional Budget Office estimates would reduce the federal deficit by more than $880 billion over the next 10 years.

Much of that, according to a summary of the recommendations, would come from the Medicaid program and the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health insurance reform package also known as “Obamacare.”

Those recommendations include, among other things, requiring Medicaid recipients to verify their income every six months instead of 12 months. It also calls for withholding federal funds under Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program for people  who do not provide proof of U.S. citizenship or satisfactory immigration status.

The package also calls for cutting by 10% the federal matching rate, known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP, for states that provide health care coverage under Medicaid or any other state-based program for undocumented immigrants.

“It could have a dramatic effect, if it actually happens,” Cunningham said of the total package of proposed cuts. “Obviously Medicaid is one of the largest tranches in our budget and we depend on a lot of reimbursement dollars from the federal government. If the federal government goes ahead with those cuts, it would cause hundreds of thousands of people in Illinois to lose their health insurance.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As House Republicans and Gov. Ron DeSantis continue to exchange barbs over taxes and the state’s budget breakdown, legislators charged with looking at property taxes challenged the governor to offer his ideas to them in person.
The House select committee set up to study potential property tax cut ideas for the 2026 ballot announced on Tuesday it had sent a letter to the governor inviting him to “participate in an upcoming meeting as we work to deliver meaningful lasting property tax relief for Floridians.”
DeSantis has already ridiculed the House Select Committee on Property Taxes as a “dog and pony show” designed to come up with reasons why the state should not push for deep cuts in property taxes. He has mocked the committee membership as being stacked with “far left Democrats” who have no interest in serious proposals.
But House Republicans have retorted that the governor has not come up with any detailed plans on his own on how to cut property taxes. DeSantis did suggest legislators consider sending a $1,000 rebate to homeowners later this year to help with their property taxes bills.
The Legislature never seriously considered the rebate idea and House Speaker Daniel Perez ripped into it shortly before the select committee met on Tuesday.
“These checks do not actually lower tax rates,” Perez said. “These checks do not solve the property tax problem. They are just state taxpayers apologizing for local government spending, which is the kind of irresponsible idea I associate with California policymakers.”
The letter from select committee co-chairs Toby Overdorf and Vicki Lopez asks DeSantis to come to the next meeting of the committee “to present your ideas directly” on “lasting and sustainable tax relief.”
DeSantis has been pushing for property tax changes for months and has criticized Perez and House Republicans for moving ahead with a plan to cut sales taxes instead.

Earlier this month Perez created the select committee and charged it with crafting constitutional amendments that could be passed by lawmakers at the start of next year’s session in January, then go to the ballot in November 2026.
DeSantis has held a spate of news conferences across the state in the past week attacking the House and Perez. In press appearances, joined by Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, the governor has asked attendees to raise their hands whether they support his proposal to eliminate property taxes or the House’s proposal to reduce sales tax.
Perez on Tuesday criticized DeSantis for these appearances, noting that he travels on a state plane supported by taxpayer dollars. He likened the governor’s antics to that of a middle school student on social media.
“The fact that the governor is choosing to continue to get on his private plane, paid for by taxpayers by the way, and go to every part of the state only to hit the House is something that he is choosing to do. It is not what I would do if I were the governor, but he’s entitled to make that decision. 
“I know today he took his private plane out to Ohio. If he were to spend  more time here in this Capitol having conversations with myself and other members of the House he’d understand my position, why we are in that position,” Perez said.
“And if he’s able to convince us otherwise and have us move in another direction, maybe his direction, he has every opportunity to do so. The difference between the governor and the House is the House is always willing to have a tough conversation. We’re always willing to answer the tough questions. We’re always willing to have the debate. The governor isn’t willing to have a conversation, period. Period. There’s no difference between him and any seventh grader in Miami-Dade County right now who tweets.”
Perez has criticized the governor for not proffering any plan to permanently reduce property taxes. By contrast, Perez has charged the select committee with developing a plan and directed it to explore a variety of potential reforms, including:

Requiring every city, county, and special district to hold a referendum on the question of eliminating property taxes on homestead properties.
Creating a new $500,000 homestead exemption, as well as a $1 million homestead exemption for properties owned by Floridians aged 65 and older, or who have had a homestead for 30 years, applicable to all non-school taxes.
Authorizing the Legislature to increase the homestead exemption to any value by general law rather than constitutional amendment.
Modifying the assessment increase limitations on property values: For homestead properties, changing the cap from the lower of 3% of the consumer price index to a flat 3% over any three-year period for all taxes. For non-homestead properties, changing the cap from 10% annually to 15% over any three-year period for all non-school taxes.
Protecting homeownership by eliminating the ability to foreclose on a homestead property due to a property tax lien.

DeSantis and the House have been clashing since before the 2025 session, starting with a special session disagreement over immigration policy and extending to the row over the chamber’s investigation into the Hope Florida Foundation and now tax relief.
The dispute has become so rancorous that Republican Party of Florida Chairman Evan Power last week suggested a summit so GOP leaders could “collaborate, unite, and deliver relief and lasting results for Florida families.” DeSantis dismissed that idea.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)As Montana moves towards warmer weather, scientists with the U.S. Department of Agriculture continue to monitor the status of the state’s snowpack and forecast how the waterways will flow this summer. But, much of the state appears to be better shape than the same time last year.
Most sites in Montana have passed their peak snow water equivalent accumulation for the season, with a majority of sites reaching near to below normal peak snowpack. 
That’s according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which released its May Water Supply Outlook Report last week. 
“The shift to spring brought to a close the bulk of the snowpack accumulation season and started the snowmelt and runoff season,” said Florence Millers, a NRCS hydrologist, in a press release about the report. 
Weather in April was slightly warmer than normal for much of the state, while precipitation varied. Across the southwest and central Montana, precipitation for the year is near normal, while in the Northwest, an early water deficit has not been overcome, and the region is between 75-90% of median precipitation. 
“Several April warm spells that brought periods of above normal temperatures and initiated snowmelt across many low-to mid-elevation SNOTEL sites,” Miller said. 
As of May 1, snowpack percentages in the southwest and central parts of the state range between 95-110% of median, while snowpack in the western portion of the state has decreased to between 75-90% of median. The Sun-Teton-Marias basis saw “well below normal” snowpack throughout the winter and is at just 61% of median snow water equivalent. 
Snow-water equivalent, rather than snow depth, is the measurement used to gauge the amount of liquid water contained within snowpack, which will be released when the snowpack melts. The snowmelt plays a key role in agriculture, hydropower production, water storage, aquatic ecosystem health and recreation such as boating and fishing, as well as flood and drought forecasting.
The May water supply report highlights that while some early season melt has already occurred at some monitoring sites across the state, “there is still a lot of water stored within the higher elevation snowpacks” and weather in the coming weeks will shape the water supply for the summer.  
In April, the Beartooth and Bighorn mountains saw roughly double their normal precipitation for the month, much of it as snow, bolstering water supply in the regions. The Flathead and Kootenai basins also saw much more precipitation than average, which could benefit Flathead Lake in the early summer months. 
The Tongue River Basin in the Bighorn Mountains has the highest snowpack compared to the 20-year median, according to NRCS data, at 111%. Meanwhile the Sun-Teton-Marias basin measured just 61% of median as of May 1.

  But is there enough water? 

Despite relatively good conditions throughout April, much of Montana is under drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
Nearly three-quarters of the state is under some level of drought conditions, which range from “abnormally dry” to “exceptional drought.” 
More than 43% of the state is under “moderate drought” conditions, while a portion of the Upper Clark Fork and Blackfoot basins are classified as “severe to extreme drought.”

The water supply forecast currently predicts much of state the will be near or below normal, ranging from 70-110% of median. At the low end of that prediction scale is the Powder River basin, currently forecast at between 60-70% of normal. 
The Flathead River Basin is at 86% of median snowpack, compared to 68% at this time last year. Streamflows on the main Flathead River are forecast around 80% of the 20-year average. 
The Upper Clark Fork Basin is sitting at 91% of median snowpack, a significant improvement from last year when it has just 56% of normal. 
The Madison River Basin has a snowpack at 86% of normal, higher than at this point last year and is forecast to have streamflows around 85% of normal. 
The Upper Missouri River Basin had a May 1 snowpack of 74% of median, significantly higher than the 42% seen in 2024.

 The big lake question 

Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River, has become a  contentious point for water policy debates following extreme drought in 2023 that saw the lake fill to less than two feet below normal. 
During the 2025 Legislative session, Montana lawmakers passed a resolution supporting recreational uses on Flathead Lake to be considered during management discussion by the myriad local, state, tribal and federal partners that coordinate the lake’s water level. 
Energy Keepers Inc., the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes company that operates the Se̓liš Ksanka Qĺispe̓ Dam on the south end of the lake, published regular updates using the latest streamflow predictions to inform the public of where it expects the lake levels to be. 
According to a May 13 update, Energy Keepers expects the lake to reach its full-pool elevation of 2,893 feet by early to mid-June. 
So far, the SKQ project has not had to coordinate flood risk management changes to its operating plan, as it has done the last two years when streamflow forecasts were much lower than normal. 
The latest update from Energy Keepers states that while expectations are for the lake to fill to normal levels, “both weather and streamflows are highly uncertain.”
“SKQ Project outflows and the Flathead Lake elevation are dependent on many variables including lake inflows, weather, the demand for electricity, and non-power constraints such as the downstream fishery and flood risk management needs.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_7532-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-13 19:08:19.460198

Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, talks with Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, during a break in debate over House Bill 78, the pension bill, on Monday, May 12, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Almost 20 years after eliminating Alaska’s public pension program, the House of Representatives has voted to open a new pension system for municipal and state workers.
With proponents saying the state’s existing, 401(k)-like retirement system is ineffective and a deterrent for hiring and retention, the House voted 21-19 late Monday to approve House Bill 78. If enacted, it would create a new pension plan and allow current employees to opt into the program.
The bill would cover Alaska’s state employees as well as all of the teachers employed by local school districts and thousands of municipal workers employed by cities and boroughs across Alaska.
The bill’s opponents cited potential costs and said they fear a repeat of the state’s prior pension system, which accrued a multibillion-dollar shortfall after a failed estimate by actuaries. 
Monday’s vote is a significant accomplishment for pension supporters: This is the first time since the old program ended in 2006 that the House has voted to restart a public pension for all state and municipal workers.
The state Senate voted in 2012 and 2024 to revive a pension program for all employees, and the House voted in 2022 to create a pension just for public safety workers, but none of those bills became law.
This time may be different. Prominent members of the state Senate have said they intend to advance a pension bill next year, which would put the issue in front of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who has previously opposed the idea.
House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, said the bill is a major priority, even if the governor vetoes it.
“The constituents who sent us here to Juneau need to see us trying, with all our might, to fix the threadbare fabric of our public services in a way that is fiscally sustainable,” he said by text message after Monday’s vote. “Every time the bill is presented, heard, and argued, the fiscal responsibility and justice of our cause shines like the noonday sun. Alaska will soon have a responsible pension plan; I don’t know what day or year, but it will have one again and we will be a competitive employer again.”
HB 78 would create a new pension investment fund separate from the existing one. Unlike in the current system, employees would be guaranteed a certain level of retirement pay, regardless of stock market performance. They also wouldn’t increase those benefits if they leave their public sector job, unlike the current system, in which benefits grow as the investments grow. 
Current employees would be allowed to switch from their 401(k)-style retirement system to the new system. 
Retirement would be possible at age 60, or with 30 years of service. Police officers and firefighters would be allowed to retire at age 55, with at least 20 years of work, or at age 50 if they’ve worked at least 25 years.
Employees would be asked to contribute 8% of their pay to the pension plan, but that would be adjustable, up to 12% of income, if needed to avoid a funding gap.
Health insurance benefits, a major contributor to the cost of the old pension system, are not included.
Pensions would be based on the highest five years of an employee’s salary, rather than the highest three years, as was the case under the old system.
Proponents have billed the pension revival as a way to fight employee turnover and alleviate a chronic worker shortage at state agencies.
Since 2006, when the pension program ended for new employees, research has found that new state and municipal workers in Alaska are now much less likely to remain in the state and frequently earn less money toward retirement under the defined contribution, or DC, plans than employees who receive pensions.
“In the world of teaching, if you’re a Tier 3 teacher, which is the DC plan, it’s called the death tier,” said Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka and a former teacher. “You’re going to teach until the day you die. That’s because studies have shown that a teacher in Tier 3 has a 30% chance of success in retirement. It’s not working for our Tier 3 teachers.”
Rep. Donna Mears, D-Anchorage, said her son was born in July 2006, the same month that the state stopped offering pensions. He’s now preparing to graduate high school, and in the intervening years, she’s had a career as an engineer.
“In that time, I’ve seen a decline in the longevity and expertise of regulators,” she said.
Kopp, speaking on the House floor, said that because the state’s retirement system has failed to meet employee demand, the state is now paying more than it should in pay and bonuses.
“This is the cost of doing nothing. It is huge. We are burning bonfires of money,” he said.
Proponents also argue that the state is spending much more than it needs to on training, because it won’t have to repeatedly retrain new employees.
“The fundamental question to me is are we going to create an environment where people can stay in Alaska or move to Alaska … and stay for a lifetime,” said Rep. Ky Holland, I-Anchorage.
Those who voted against the bill on Monday said they are concerned about the accuracy of cost projections and doubt that the bill will deliver on backers’ promises.
“You can say it’s a more modern version (of a pension). Perhaps it is, but it feels like it is still an unaffordable model,” said Rep. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla.
Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, noted that actuaries failed to accurately track prior costs.
“We are asking them to trust the actuarials. How did that work out last time?” he said.
Kopp responded by saying that this time, the pension system will rely on three independently operating actuarial estimates, not one potential point of failure.
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, said the bill offers a chance to stop the “everlasting hamster wheel” of employee training and will be a big morale booster for public employees.
“This is a vote of hope that we can do better,” he said.
Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, wasn’t convinced.
“There’s a lot in this bill that we don’t understand, and we don’t really have a grasp on how much it’s going to cost us, and we are literally — to quote another member — making a vote of hope. Oh, that doesn’t give me a lot of confidence. I hope that it does work out well, but if it does not work out well, what is plan B?”
House Bill 78 advances to the Senate, which is expected to take up the measure when the Legislature reconvenes in January 2026.

(Courtesy of David Seligman)Worker and consumer rights attorney David Seligman, executive director of the Denver-based progressive legal nonprofit Towards Justice, will join the 2026 race to be Colorado’s next attorney general. 
Seligman, a Democrat, told Newsline Colorado voters need to know that he is “new to politics, but I’m not new to this work.” He said he’s spent his entire career “fighting for regular people” in Colorado and across the country, and the role of attorney general is an extension of that work. 
“I’ve seen how there are two sets of laws in this country — one for the rich and powerful and one for everybody else, and right now those problems are more acute than ever,” Seligman told Newsline. “We’re seeing the Trump administration and his billionaire backers dismantle the parts of the federal government that are really essential to protecting workers and consumers and small businesses and the environment, and now more than ever we need state AGs that not only are going to fill in the void left by the federal government, but that are going to fight for a better world.”

Towards Justice represented a Colorado grocery store worker in a lawsuit against Kroger and Albertsons alleging the companies illegally colluded by entering into a “no poach” agreement amid a 2022 strike against King Soopers. Seligman’s organization also represented UCHealth patients ​who alleged a third-party collections vendor’s lawsuits against patients of the hospital violated state law.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is term-limited and announced he will run for Colorado governor in 2026. The Democrat joined a growing number of legal challenges to Trump administration policies. 
Seligman said Weiser has done “a terrific job of fighting back against the abuses of the Trump administration,” but he thinks “we need to double down even more” to protect the rights of Colorado consumers and workers. He said the office of attorney general “can be put back on the side of regular people” and “make people’s lives better” while also challenging actions from the Trump administration.  
Early supporters for Seligman’s campaign include some of the Colorado Legislature’s most progressive members. Supporters include Colorado state Sens. Julie Gonzales and Mike Weissman, House Assistant Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon, House Majority Whip Elizabeth Valesco, Denver City Council member Sarah Parady, and state Reps. Meg Froelich, Lorena Garcia, Javier Mabrey, Emily Sirota, Steven Woodrow and Yara Zokaie, according to the campaign. 
“Our campaign will be based on renewed hope that we can and will hold powerful, corrupt interests accountable and make them play by the same rules as the rest of us, so that regular people have a fighting chance to achieve the American dream we all seek,” Seligman said in a statement announcing his run. 
The attorney general heads the Colorado Department of Law and oversees enforcement of consumer protection and antitrust laws, defends state laws in legal challenges, and advocates for law enforcement and community safety.  
Other Democrats running for attorney general include Secretary of State Jena Griswold, Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and former speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Crisanta Duran. Conner Peddington is the only Republican candidate to file paperwork in the race so far.
Primary elections to decide party nominees for state offices will be held in June 2026.

""We're crowdsourcing a little bit among ourselves.”","Aerial shot of the NIOSH campus in Bruceton, Allegheny County. (Photo from the CDC)The Pittsburgh-area lab responsible for certifying virtually all U.S. government-approved respirators in the country was preparing to shutter for good in June. The Capital-Star reported last month that employees had been told their positions were being eliminated as part of sweeping cuts to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The lab is responsible for certifying and auditing just about every N95, as well as masks worn by doctors, firefighters, welders, coal miners, and other professionals.
But those plans changed Tuesday afternoon. Officials with the local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees union say many, if not all, employees remaining at the Bruceton facility, many of whom were on administrative leave, received an email telling them their jobs were safe — at least for the moment. 
“You previously received a notice regarding the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) upcoming reduction in force,” read an email sent to lab employees by Thomas Nagy, the agency’s acting chief human capital officer, and shared with the Capital-Star. “That notice is hereby revoked. You will not be affected by the upcoming RIF.”
The employee who shared the email did so under the condition of anonymity, for fear of retaliation.
But a union official told the Capital-Star between recent buyouts, layoffs and early retirements, it’s been difficult to say with certainty how many employees remain. And with so many on administrative leave, it’s been hard to confirm if anyone did not receive the notification Tuesday.
“We’re still trying to figure out what it all means and who it all covers,” said Suzanne Alison, a steward at the local American Federation of Government Employees chapter that represents Allegheny County’s NIOSH employees. “We’re crowdsourcing a little bit among ourselves.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to detailed questions about the decision to reverse the planned cuts, but said that, “The Trump Administration remains committed to supporting coal miners, who play a vital role in America’s energy sector. Under Secretary [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]’s leadership, NIOSH’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program will continue to meet the needs of our nation’s miners.”
Workers at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab learned their jobs were no longer being cut on the same day a U.S. District Court judge in West Virginia granted an injunction ordering employees of NIOSH’s mine safety and respiratory health divisions return to work following previous cuts. That was in response to a class action case led by West Virginia coal miner, Harry Wiley.
It’s unclear if there was any connection between the ruling and the reversal of cuts to the respirator certification lab. Alison said the ruling likely only affected employees at NIOSH’s Morgantown division, who also faced steep cuts earlier this year.
West Virginia Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito said Tuesday on the social media platform X that over 100 employees would be returning to work at the Morgantown facility.
However, employees at NIOSH’s Pittsburgh-area Mining Research Division, which studies best practices  for avoiding workplace injuries and deaths, do not appear to have received the same notices as those at the respirator certification lab, Alison said.
Kennedy is scheduled to testify Wednesday before both the U.S. House Appropriations committee and the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee to discuss his agency’s proposed budget, which includes drastic staff cuts.
There are two Pennsylvania representatives on the House Appropriations panel, Republican Guy Reschenthaler and Democrat Madeleine Dean.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Noticed apartment buildings cropping up next to bus and light rail stations? More could be on the way.
Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday signed House Bill 1491 into law, setting new state requirements for mixed-income housing development near transit and incentivizing this kind of construction.
So-called “transit-oriented development” allows for more dense housing, which Washington desperately needs, while also potentially reducing pollution as more people use buses and rail to commute instead of driving.
“This bill can help Washington meet its housing and environmental goals,” Ferguson said. “I actually live very close to a light rail station and so I have some familiarity with this and how important it is.”
The first cities eyed for development around transit are Vancouver and Spokane, the governor said. 
“By 2029, we expect to see new zoning around 100 rail stations and more than 200 bus stations in the Puget Sound area,” Ferguson added. 
Incentivizing transit-oriented development was one of the top priorities included in Lt. Gov. Denny Heck’s Housing Action Plan, developed during Ferguson’s transition to the governor’s office.
Not only that, the report said no other policy would result in more homes than this one.
Last year, a similar bill passed the House before stalling in the Senate.
This year’s measure requires Washington cities to allow housing development in what are called bus and rail “station areas.” 
This includes places within a half-mile of a light rail station, commuter rail stop in a large city or a western Washington trolley system, like Seattle’s Streetcar. It also covers areas within a quarter-mile of bus rapid transit stops. 
In these locations, the bill sets guidelines for how dense the housing must be. Developers would get to fit even more building square footage on their lots if they build affordable housing or so-called workforce housing intended for people earning low and moderate incomes.
The bill also requires 10% of units to be considered affordable and 20% set aside for workforce housing for the next 50 years. The legislation defines affordable as not costing more than 30% of the income for renters who make up 60% of the county’s median income or homeowners who make 80% of the median.
Developers who meet the requirements would get a 20-year multifamily property tax exemption. And they’d get half off local impact fees meant to help pay for transportation projects to accommodate the population growth.
Cities also can’t require off-street parking, except spots dedicated for people with disabilities or delivery drivers.
Under the legislation, the state Department of Commerce also needs to set up a new grant program to help cities build infrastructure to provide utilities and other services. 
The bill passed the Legislature along mostly party lines. Though supportive of the general concept, some Republicans objected to the affordability component, which they thought would drive developers away from building housing near transit.
The legislation takes effect in late July. But implementation of the new requirements wouldn’t come until 2029 for cities that updated their comprehensive plans last year. Cities that next revise their plans later than 2024 must follow the new rules within six months of updating. 
The piece of legislation is one of many Ferguson has signed in his first year to remove barriers to additional housing, including for condominiums. He also signed a bill last week to ease parking requirements that can pose a costly obstacle to development. It’s the top issue he heard on the campaign trail last year, he said.

U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued Tuesday’s preliminary injunction as part of ongoing litigation in a class action lawsuit filed by coal miners against the federal government over the closure of the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program, a department within NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division. 
Workers at the CWHSP, as well as numerous other NIOSH departments and divisions, have been on administrative leave since April due to “reorganizations” happening at the federal level. Permanent terminations for most employees were scheduled to occur in June and July as part of cost-saving measures instituted by the new federal Department of Government Efficiency.
Berger’s order on Tuesday directed the federal Department of Health and Human Services to do three things: rescind all RIFs issued to workers in the Respiratory Health Division at NIOSH, continue all work mandated by the federal Mine Safety and Health Act without “pause, stoppage or gap” if and when the federal government continues efforts to “reorganize” itself and have DHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. submit a written certification to the court in 20 days showing that the federal government is complying with its orders.
At a hearing for the case in Charleston last week, coal miners testified that, without staffing at the CWHSP, they are unable to exercise rights afforded to them through the federal Mine Act.
Utilizing those rights — which have existed for decades and are mandated through an act of Congress — requires action by NIOSH’s CWHSP. 
But since April 1, the department has been unstaffed. Some workers were told to return to work in early May. But last week they were once again put back on leave. On Tuesday, hours before Berger’s order was filed, members of West Virginia’s congressional delegation announced that at least 100 NIOSH workers were returning to work permanently. 
Without any workers, coal miners across the country have been unable to have black lung screening results certified by NIOSH. That certification is necessary for miners with black lung to qualify for a Part 90 transfer, which allows them to move to a different, less dusty part of a mine without retribution — including a cut in pay, hours or benefits — from their employers.
Arguments in the case and Berger’s ruling
Attorneys for the miners have argued that the rights afforded to coal miners to access free black lung screenings and secure transfers once diagnosed, among other services, cannot be stopped just because the federal government is going through a reorganization. Berger agreed, saying Kennedy and DHHS “lack the authority to unilaterally cancel the CWHSP” since it exists to serve a responsibility mandated by congress.
“[DHHS and Kennedy] do not indicate how many extra months of dust inhalation, in their considered judgment, is acceptable for a miner with black lung while the program Congress established to eliminate that risk is ‘paused,’” Berger wrote.
Attorneys for the federal government argued that the lawsuit should be thrown out because it deals with employees angry over being terminated, which does not justify a federal class action suit. Berger called those claims “patently absurd,” saying the plaintiffs in the case are not employees, but are beneficiaries of programs that were stopped through “illegal agency action” at DHHS.
The federal government also alleged that services ending at NIOSH and specifically the CWHSP were temporary and couldn’t be construed as being a final agency action. They maintained that, since those services were likely to return, there was no immediate harm present that necessitated a preliminary injunction.
In her order, however, Berger again disagreed and noted that the federal government repeatedly failed to show evidence outlining how CWHSP’s services would be resumed, when that would happen or in what manner. She wrote that testimony from NIOSH employees and the case’s lead plaintiff, Harry Wiley, presented “overwhelming evidence” that the work had been stopped — not just paused. 
“The [federal government’s] evidence consisted solely of press releases regarding a planned reorganization of HHS that contained no mention of the programs at issue. Thus, the only evidence before the Court is that the CWHSP and the RHD have been shut down,” Berger wrote.
That shut down, she said, presented clear harm as miners with black lung like Wiley were being continually exposed to dangerous coal dust despite congressional actions existing that are meant to shield them from such.
“As the testimony before the Court made clear, that dust exposure will cause [Wiley’s] disease to progress until it becomes debilitating. Does [Kennedy] genuinely believe that a miner diagnosed with black lung is not being injured when the program designed to confirm his condition and provide him with workplace protections to prevent its progression is rendered inaccessible?” Berger wrote. “This Court does not share such a belief.”
There is no cure and limited treatment options for black lung. The only adequate intervention for people who have the disease, experts say, is limiting exposure to dangerous coal dust that is known to exacerbate it.
Wiley lives in Kanawha County but works in a Raleigh County mine as a mine electrician.
A miner for 38 years, Wiley was diagnosed with black lung disease in November 2024 by a local clinic. He sent the results to NIOSH to start proceedings to be approved for a Part 90 transfer. In December, according to evidence submitted to the court, NIOSH sent a letter to Wiley saying a CT scan from October 2023 did not show findings of black lung. 
Wiley testified that he never received this letter. He called NIOSH multiple times to follow up on his transfer request and got no response. If he had known they were looking at an outdated scan, he told the court, he would have submitted additional evidence to verify his black lung diagnosis and secure his Part 90 letter. And if the CWHSP were still functional, he said, he would have accessed a free screening through the agency.
Instead, Wiley — and every other miner in the country who has been unable to contact or work with NIOSH over recent months for a Part 90 transfer — has been forced to continue working in dustier parts of the mine. 
Berger said it’s clear, given how black lung develops and the lack of treatments for it, that keeping the CWHSP functional is overwhelmingly and “strongly” in the public’s interest.
“[NIOSH epidemiologists] testified that they are seeing more miners with black lung, and more cases that progress quickly. They also testified that their work, and the work of the CWHSP as a whole, saves lives,” Berger said. “The necessary inverse of that testimony is that cancelling the CWHSP will cost lives. Remaining in a dusty job may reduce the years in which Mr. Wiley can walk and breathe unassisted, in addition to hastening his death. It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of irreparable harm.”

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)One of the New Mexico Legislature’s top budget advisers says he expects the federal government’s planned budget cuts to make it harder to qualify for the state’s health insurance program for low-income people.
Medicaid is under threat from the executive branch and Congress. On Sunday, House Republicans released a plan that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would cut $715 billion cut to Medicaid funding. As of publication on Tuesday, a U.S. House committee tasked with that work was starting what was expected to be a long and grueling session on the proposals.
Also on Tuesday, at the state Legislative Finance Committee’s first meeting since this year’s legislative session, Director Charles Sallee told lawmakers that in the worst-case scenario, the Republican proposal would translate to cuts of more than $1.1 billion for New Mexico’s Medicaid program.
Sallee said work requirements for some Medicaid patients are “guaranteed” to be included in the Congressional budget as an additional eligibility condition for nondisabled adults without dependents on Medicaid. That could dramatically increase the number of people who don’t qualify for health insurance under the program, he said.
“It remains to be seen just how tough Congress will make the work requirements,” Sallee said.
Whether people who lose their Medicaid coverage will be able to find a low-cost or free alternative health insurance policy through the state’s BeWell exchange, or lose coverage altogether remains an open question, he said.
Sallee also said provider taxes, which the state government levies on nurses and hospitals, are on the chopping block. That could upend programs designed to enhance service quality in those facilities, he said.
Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) asked whether Congress is considering the potential increase in social costs of people losing their health insurance, and Sallee said no.
“Part of the benefit of giving people access to health insurance is that they’ll go to their doctor for ear infections or things that you don’t need to go to the emergency room for,” Trujillo said. “That’s an indirect cost that’s going to increase, because it costs thousands of dollars more to go and get your ear looked at in an emergency room than it does to go to your health care provider.”

Vermont utility companies are seeing a rise in cyberattacks.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Is Vermont’s electrical grid safe from hackers?.","Power lines converge at switching stations for Green Mountain Power and VELCO in Williston. Seen on March 9, 2021. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“The exact numbers on that I don’t know because it is literally continuous.”That’s what Dan Nelson, chief technology officer for the Vermont Electric Power Company, said Tuesday when lawmakers asked how many cyber attacks the utility company faces each year. Speaking before members of the House Committee on Energy and Digital Infrastructure on Tuesday, representatives from Vermont’s other major utilities all told a similar story. “We’ve seen an uptick in activity in recent months targeted at the electrical sector,” said Mark Dincecco, chief technology officer at Green Mountain Power, the state’s largest utility company. “Nothing of consequence, but we do see activity ramping up a bit — more of a yellow alert, not a red alert.”Who are these intrepid individuals doggedly trying to hack our state’s grid, and what do they want? It’s hard to say. “It’s not always easy to tell precisely where they’re coming from,” said Dincecco, who noted the vast majority of the threats are simple ‘phishing’ attacks in which hackers use fake emails and messages to try to extract sensitive information from users.In any case, the firewalls are holding. Since 2019, each of the state’s 17 utilities has been required by law to adopt cybersecurity programs. In the intervening years, officials said Tuesday, utilities have matched the influx in cyberthreats with a slew of policies aimed at strengthening firewalls and locking down the grid.“I’ve been with the department a bit over three years, and in that time we’ve made a number of substantial upgrades in software, operations, user training, much of which I can’t talk about,” said Erica Ferland, director of information technology at Burlington Electric Department. “But (they’re) good.” For all the progress Vermont’s utilities have made in neutralizing the threat of Russian bots and North Korean hackers, there are some problems officials are still scratching their heads over.Here’s something that wasn’t on my threats-to-Vermont’s-electrical-grid bingo card: during hunting season, muzzleloaders apparently like to play target practice with our power lines.“There’s an attraction to shooting at fiber bundles going across fields or from tower to tower,” Dincecco said. “It’s just random trouble makers, basically, just shooting at things to see if they can hit them.”— Habib SabetIn the knowTwo Vermont health insurance companies are seeking higher premiums for plans bought on the state marketplace in 2026, requests that come amid rapidly rising health care costs statewide.Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont is seeking to raise the cost of its premiums by an average of 23.3% for individual plans and 13.7% for small group plans on the state health insurance exchange next year. MVP, the other insurer that sells on the exchange, is seeking average increases of 6.2% for individual plans and 7.5% for small group plans. Individual plans cover single Vermonters or families, while small group plans are bought by employers with 100 or fewer people. Each spring, health insurers ask the Green Mountain Care Board, a state health care regulator, to approve changes to the cost of plans bought on the Vermont insurance marketplace, Vermont Health Connect. Read more about the requested rate increases here.— Peter D’AuriaOn the HillIn Washington, D.C., House Republicans plan to gather Tuesday to vote on whether to shred the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark law that has issued hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy incentives since 2022, as part of President Donald Trump’s new budget proposal.Meanwhile, in Vermont on Tuesday morning, a state program funded by that very law announced more than $22 million of the state’s total grant of $62.5 million would go to help install solar power on low-income housing in the state.“Currently towns with the highest energy burden in Vermont have the least amount of installed solar,” Kerrick Johnson, commissioner for the Department of Public Service, which controls the state’s grant, said in a statement. “That’s why the primary objective of this program is to deliver benefits to disadvantaged Vermonters, regardless of their dwelling status.”Read more on the Inflation Reduction Act here.— Austyn GaffneyOn the moveThe House and Senate will go to a conference committee over S.51, a bill that, in its latest form, expands tax credits and tax exemptions for low-income families, workers and veterans, as well as retirees and people receiving military pensions.But the House, in developing the legislation, removed a Senate-approved provision creating a tax credit for unpaid caregivers. The House’s tax credit package would reduce state revenue by more than $13 million. The Senate’s bill would reduce revenue by about $6 million. Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, said Tuesday that her committee needs to finish the education bill before she can turn her attention to the tax credit package. She said she’s open to the House’s bill, but she’s long been skeptical of providing unique benefits to military retirees over other groups like police officers and firefighters. — Ethan WeinsteinVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Is Vermont’s electrical grid safe from hackers?.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/power-lines-1-20210309-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-13 19:08:19.460198

For almost a year, plaintiffs in the Kappa Kappa Gamma case have failed to take action. They now have 30 days to refile, or lawsuit's dismissal will be final. 
The post Federal court sets deadline in UW transgender sorority sister lawsuit appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal court has ordered six students who sued their University of Wyoming sorority for admitting a transgender woman to fish or cut bait because they have failed to take action on the pending case for nearly a year. 
In March 2023, the plaintiffs — Jaylyn Westenbroek, Hannah Holtmeier, Allison Coghan, Grace Choate, Madeline Ramar and Megan Kosar — accused Kappa Kappa Gamma at UW of breaking its bylaws, breaching housing contracts and misleading sisters when it admitted Artemis Langford by a vote of its members. 
But the government cannot interfere with how a private, voluntary organization determines its members, according to U.S. District Court Judge Alan B. Johnson, who dismissed the case in August 2023. 
The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals also dismissed the case in June 2024, but on the basis that the lower court’s decision was not a final judgment and therefore not appealable. 
More specifically, Johnson’s ruling was “without prejudice,” which gave the plaintiffs the option to refile an amended complaint. As such, the appeals court gave the plaintiffs two choices — amend their complaint or ask the lower court for a final judgment. 
“Despite these instructions, Plaintiffs have taken no action,” Johnson wrote in his order to impose a deadline. 
“More than nine months after the Tenth Circuit issued its decision, they have neither amended their complaint nor notified us of their decision to ‘stand on the original complaint,’ which would allow them to receive a final judgment that could be appealed,” Johnson wrote.

The plaintiffs have 30 days to file an amended complaint, or Johnson’s dismissal will convert to a final judgment and the plaintiffs will no longer have the option to refile. 
Such a deadline came at the request of Kappa Kappa Gamma, which filed the motion after the defendants told Johnson in January that they did not have a plan for how to proceed in the case. 
Since Johnson’s 2023 ruling, an Ohio court transferred a lawsuit to Wyoming’s U.S. District Court because of its similarity to the case. Patsy Levang and Cheryl Tuck-Smith, two Kappa Kappa Gamma alumni, filed the complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the organization after it expelled them. 
The two women openly opposed Kappa’s trans-inclusive policy and supported the plaintiffs in the Wyoming case, including writing an op-ed that was published in the National Review without the sorority’s prior approval. That violated Kappa’s media policy, according to court filings, and both women were kicked out of the organization by a vote of its fraternity council. 
Levang and Tuck-Smith argue the termination was retaliatory in their complaint. They also argue that Kappa “is bound to defend the single-sex nature” of the organization, and by including transgender women, it has “improperly attempted to broaden its membership criteria.”
But the additional litigation is all the more reason the case in Wyoming should not be delayed, the defendants argued in their request for a deadline. 
“The court should not permit plaintiffs to hold this case in limbo as individuals who supported their claims and share legal counsel seek to have a different court reach a different conclusion on the same derivative claim and legal issues this court has already addressed without being bound by the preclusion doctrines that would attach to a final order,” according to the motion.

Separately, attorneys for Langford have asked the court to dismiss her from the case. 
“While certain plaintiffs have made careers out of this case and may now be booked for speaking engagements on women’s issues, Ms. Langford has been vilified in the media coverage viewed tens of millions of times,” Rachel Berkness, an attorney for Langford, argued in a motion that included 67 exhibits of mostly online comments. 
“Ms. Langford has had to bear the backlash of plaintiffs’ allegations for nearly two years,” Berkness argued. 
The plaintiffs have until June 9 to file an amended complaint.

“I'm excited to be part of the voice that is working to uphold the law of the land and the Constitution,” said a new citizen and Middlebury College professor.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont welcomes 20 new American citizens.","Newly naturalized citizens receive their certificates after reciting the oath of allegiance. Tuesday, May 13. Photos by Greta Solsaa/VTDiggerCHITTENDEN — Twenty new citizens originally from 11 different countries took an oath of allegiance to the United States at a naturalization ceremony Tuesday held in the gymnasium of Barstow Memorial School in Chittenden. Among those naturalized in the ceremony was Steeve Valcourt, a musician originally from Haiti.Valcourt, 42, said he toured around the country including Vermont as a musician playing reggae and Haitian music with his band Lakou Mizik for years, but settled in Woodstock to raise his daughter. Valcourt said he chose to make Vermont his home two years ago because of the sense of “peace” the state provides. He said he feels “lighter” after being naturalized in the U.S. and is grateful for the opportunities and rights he has access to as a citizen. “The United States is made with immigrants,” he said, so it’s important for the U.S. to “open the doors for immigrants” so more people come to the country legally. In remarks at the ceremony, Chief U.S. District Judge Christina Reiss welcomed the new citizens and spoke to the importance of upholding the rule of law and actively engaging in the rights and responsibilities of citizens to protect democracy. “The right to vote is endangered each time you fail to vote. The freedom of speech is threatened if you do not express your opinions and stand silent,” said Reiss. “It is also threatened when you do not tolerate the views of others and allow their speech to be violated. The rights of all citizens must be protected if you expect your own to be protected.”Reiss also reflected on President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s address to Vermont at the State Dairy Festival in nearby Rutland 70 years prior in 1955, echoing his words for the ceremony attendees: “I know that Americans everywhere are the same, in their longing for peace, a peace that is characterized by justice, by consideration for others, by decency above all, by its insistence on respect for the individual human being.”Photos by Greta Solsaa/VTDiggerElizabeth Bernstein, a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and resident from Jericho, attended the ceremony to help new citizens register to vote and facilitate civic participation. Bernstein said the ceremony was an important reminder of the importance for citizens to uphold the rule of law. But, she said she is concerned with recent actions by the executive branch, which judges and lawyers spoke out about recently. Susan Harritt, another member of the Daughters of the American Revolution from Jericho, said she was heartened to hear Reiss’ remarks about the importance of immigrants to the country. “The arrival of new people — the variety, the diversity of new people — makes this country richer. We benefit from the infusion of new views,” Harritt said. Among the naturalized citizens was David Munro, who arrived from Canada for his family and his job at Middlebury College as an associate economics professor.READ MORE
Munro, 40 and a resident of Middlebury, said it was special to have the event set in an educational environment that gave children the opportunity to learn and be a part of a meaningful moment for many. Students from Barstow Memorial School shared poetry, music and helped facilitate the celebration of citizenship.“I’m excited to be part of the voice that is working to uphold the law of the land and the Constitution,” Munro said. Christine Rogers, 60, said she emigrated to the U.S. from Germany in 1986 after marrying an American soldier and having two children. Rogers has now made East Thetford her home and works as a housekeeper at a retirement home in Hanover, New Hampshire. “I was crying, it was happy tears. It’s been a long time coming,” Rogers said. “I can vote and go to town meetings and voice my opinions.”Valerie Frolova, a 29-year-old interior architectural designer based in Newfane, moved to the U.S. from Russia to study at Temple University. She said found that she resonated with the U.S. culture and people. She met her current husband while a student in Philadelphia and the couple eventually settled in Vermont, Frovola said. Frovola said she wanted to mark her “long journey” toward naturalization but finds it difficult to celebrate because of the fraught political landscape regarding immigration and rights to free speech. But, Frovola said she has faith in U.S. democracy and is excited to participate in the process to uphold rights and responsibilities of all as a citizen after making that promise alongside 19 others Tuesday. “I think the U.S. had different turbulent moments throughout history, but it always made it out OK on the other side,” Frolova said. “Now, as a participating citizen and voting citizen, I can be a part of that change as well.” Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont welcomes 20 new American citizens.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/naturalization-ceremony-3-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-13 19:08:19.460198

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Two North Dakota judges have ruled that lawsuits filed by landowners against carbon pipeline company Summit Carbon Solutions can proceed over objections about court procedures.
Several landowners are suing Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions, which is attempting to build a network of pipelines across five states. The pipelines would take carbon dioxide emissions captured at ethanol plants to sites in western North Dakota for permanent underground storage. 
Attorneys for Summit had filed motions to dismiss the lawsuits, arguing that not all parties involved were properly notified and that the cases were not filed in the proper court. 
Iowa Senate passes bill restricting eminent domain for carbon pipelines

South Central Judicial District Court Judge Pam Nesvig issued her ruling Friday rejecting Summit’s arguments in one case in which landowners are suing Summit and the North Dakota Public Service Commission.
South Central Judicial District Court Judge Jackson Lofgren filed a similar ruling Tuesday in another case in which landowners are suing Summit entities and the North Dakota Industrial Commission. 
The Public Service Commission in November granted Summit a permit for its pipeline route, about 333 miles through southeast and south-central North Dakota. 
The Industrial Commission in December granted permits for underground permanent storage of carbon dioxide in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties. 
South Central Judicial District Court Judge David Reich has yet to rule on a motion to dismiss in another case where Burleigh County is suing the North Dakota Public Service Commission and Summit Carbon Solutions. 
Among the issues raised in the PSC cases is that the agency did not give enough consideration to the safety of residents along the pipeline route. The lawsuit also challenges the PSC’s ruling that state zoning rules trump county zoning ordinances on pipelines.
The PSC ruled last year that a 2019 state law gives the state the upper hand on pipeline setbacks – such as how far away the pipeline must be from a residence – after Summit said Emmons and Burleigh had passed unreasonable set ordinances. 
In the Industrial Commission case, landowners contend the state Department of Mineral Resources withheld information about Summit’s models that would predict where the carbon dioxide would move when the gas is pumped underground. The Industrial Commission oversees the Department of Mineral Resources, which recommended approving the storage permits. About 92% of landowners have voluntarily agreed to participate in the storage facility.
CO2 storage law challenged in North Dakota Supreme Court hearing

In yet another case, the North Dakota Supreme Court heard arguments last month in a challenge to a state law related to underground storage of CO2. 
The Northwest Landowners Association and other landowners contend a state law that can force landowners to take part in an underground CO2 storage project through a process called amalgamation is unconstitutional. Summit Carbon Solutions is taking part in the defense of that law along with the state of North Dakota and the Industrial Commission. An attorney for Minnkota Power, who joined the Industrial Commission in arguing to the Supreme Court, said a small percentage of property owners should not be able to deny a majority the right to develop their property.
Summit’s pipelines are planned to connect 57 ethanol plants, including Tharaldson Ethanol at Casselton, to the underground carbon storage sites.
Summit so far has been denied a permit in South Dakota. It has obtained permits in Iowa and for part of its Minnesota route. Nebraska has no state permitting for carbon pipelines. 
Supporters of the Summit project say it would support the ethanol industry by lowering the carbon intensity score of the ethanol plants, opening up potential sales in low-carbon fuel markets. 
The project would take advantage of federal tax credits promoting carbon sequestration to combat greenhouse gas emissions.

(Photo courtesy Santa Fe Public Schools)Leaders from New Mexico’s “micro school districts” emphasized to lawmakers on Tuesday the need for local control, more state funding and opportunities for students and teachers in rural areas.
According to an LFC brief, micro school districts are ones with 200 or fewer students; New Mexico has 20 such districts spread throughout rural areas of the state serving a total of 2,360 students.
Mosquero Municipal Schools, one of the state’s micro school districts, hosted members of the Legislative Finance Committee Tuesday for the first LFC meeting of the interim this year. Mosquero is located in northeast New Mexico in Harding and San Miguel counties. 
Mosquero Municipal Schools Governing Board President Victor Vigil told lawmakers local control is key to districts’ success and a one-size-fits-all approach does not make sense when comparing districts that serve only a couple hundred students and more urban districts serving thousands. He emphasized that schools in rural areas serve not only as places of learning, but also as community gathering places and sources of information because libraries, museums, businesses and other facilities are not readily accessible.
“The school is the heartbeat of the town. It’s the heartbeat of a community, especially in a rural area,” Vigil said during the meeting.
Mosquero Superintendent Johnna Bruhn highlighted the need for additional state funds for micro districts. According to the LFC hearing brief, micro districts received $26,100 per student from the State Equalization Guarantee distribution this year, compared to the statewide average of $13,900. However, funding does not stretch as far in rural areas as in urban areas, she said.
“One of the things that would help is if micro districts were funded like we had 100 kids, even if we don’t,” Bruhn said. “That would allow us to make the…adjustments that we need to deliver all the educational requirements that this state has for our kids, to our kids. With less than that, we can’t do it.”
The LFC brief noted that micro districts rely chronically on emergency supplemental funds from the Public Education Department.
Bruhn also pointed out that if the PED’s rule requiring 180 instructional days in a school year were implemented in her district, it would require changing the calendar to a five-day school week with a later start time to allow students and staff to travel to school. She said that would increase travel time to about 15 hours per week rather than the current 12 hours.
“Instructional time would actually decrease to 27.5 hours per week. The four-day week is essential here,” she said.
Bruhn added that more incentives to entice highly qualified teachers to work in micro districts are needed, including housing because many staff members, including herself, live in surrounding towns. 
Rep. Derrick Lente (D-Sandia Pueblo), a member of the LFC, said many of the concerns Bruhn presented are similar to those of Native communities in New Mexico. Local control of how and what students are taught is influenced by culture and tradition — lawmakers noted during the discussion that Mosquero and the surrounding area is largely influenced by agricultural work.
“If what is important to this community is farming and ranching, the same thing is being said by those pueblos, tribes and nations when we talk about making sure that what we’re teaching our children in terms of a culture, in terms of a practice are rooted in a native language,” Lente said. “I think that we need to share these with the PED because these shouldn’t be a liability, but these should be an eye opener in terms of how we need to look at things differently for rural education.”

(Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed an executive order Tuesday that aims to give colleges and universities legal cover to directly pay college athletes. 
The order purports to prohibit the NCAA, an athletic conference or another organization with oversight of college athletics from taking action against Louisiana schools that directly compensate athletes, pay them for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL) or facilitate NIL deals for the athlete. 
The order, similar to one Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed last year, would not allow schools to use state money to pay athletes. 
Athletic directors at LSU and Southern University praised the governor’s order. 
“This will afford all higher education institutions in the state of Louisiana the ability to remain nimble and at the forefront of the ever-changing college athletics landscape,” LSU Athletic Director Scott Woodward said in the governor’s news release. 
While NCAA rules currently prohibit the paying of players, athletes are allowed to make money through NIL endorsement deals. 
Landry’s order would become moot if Congress approves legislation to regulate NIL deals or if a settlement is finalized in a lawsuit against the NCAA over compensation owed to former college athletes who weren’t paid for use of their name, image or likeness. The settlement is expected to set the stage for revenue sharing with college athletes — and possibly pave the way for direct payments to them. 
The Louisiana Legislature is considering new proposals on name, image and likeness, including two bills that would exempt athletes’ NIL money from state income tax. 
House Bill 166 by Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, would exempt the entirety of athletes’ NIL income from the state taxes. McMakin, an LSU alum whose father played baseball for the Tigers in the 1970s, said he proposed the legislation because LSU is competing for athletes against states like Texas that don’t have an income tax. 
House Bill 168 by Rep. Rashid Young, D-Homer, would exempt the first $12,500 of athletes’ NIL income from state taxes. That aligns the exemption with the standardized deduction offered to every other Louisiana resident. It’s not clear if this legislation is necessary for the athletes to receive the deduction, but Young said he wanted to make sure they get it. 
Young has also proposed a resolution to create a task force to study the need for increased transparency on name, image and likeness along with related issues.

Steven Horsford, Democrat of Nevada, called the legislation a “scam.”Horsford, who sits on the Ways and Means Committee, said during a separate press conference with the advocacy group Popular Democracy that extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts would “gut Medicaid.”Medicaid is the state-federal health care program for people with low incomes and certain people with disabilities, and has 71.3 million enrollees. “This would be the largest cut to health care in the history of our country,” Horsford said.Rep. Judy Chu, Democrat of California, said only the ultra wealthy, such as billionaires, would benefit from reconciliation through tax cuts.The cost of the tax proposal has not yet been released, but government deficit watchdogs estimated a wholesale extension would cost roughly $4 trillion over the next decade.SNAP costs shifted in part to statesThe House committees on Agriculture, Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means met Tuesday to debate and pass their bills.The Agriculture panel seeks to hit as much as $290 billion in cuts by passing part of the costs of SNAP to states through a sliding pay scale, based on error rates.States with the lowest error rates for SNAP benefits would only pay for 5%, while other states with higher rates could pay as much for 25% of food benefits. More than 42 million people rely on SNAP, which is currently completely funded by the federal government.The Energy and Commerce bill would cut federal spending by $880 billion, such as by instituting work requirements for Medicaid for some able-bodied adults ages between 19 and 65.House committees have already signed off on eight of the 11 bills that will make up the sweeping reconciliation legislation before the Budget Committee rolls the bills into one package. If all Republicans get on board, the House is on track to approve the entire package before the end of May.Warnings of rising premiums, hospital closingsSenate Democrats slammed potential cuts and changes to Medicaid.""Not only will millions of Americans lose coverage — for many others, their premiums will skyrocket,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said at a press conference Tuesday.""Hospitals — rural, urban and in between — will close,” the New York Democrat said. ""Many, many people will lose their jobs, and many more will lose their health coverage.

Ron Wyden also blasted the proposed cuts.“What the Republicans do in their health care provisions in the reconciliation package is walk back health security for millions and millions of Americans,” he said.""We're for a tax code that gives everybody in America the chance to get ahead, that’s something that we’re going to battle for in this process,” said Wyden, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance.Senate GOPSome Republicans have also raised concerns about cuts to Medicaid, such as Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who wrote in an opinion piece in the New York Times that any cuts to Medicaid would be “both morally wrong and politically suicidal.”But Senate Majority Leader, John Thune of South Dakota, said Tuesday that he feels “very good” about where House Republicans are on their bill and “where, ultimately, we are going to be on that bill as well.”""We are coordinating very closely with our House counterparts at the committee level, at the leadership level, and we know they have to get 218 votes,” he said.Thune said House Republicans will ""do what it takes to get it done in the House, and when it comes over here, we will be prepared for various contingencies, obviously, one of which could be taking up the House bill and then offering a Senate substitute, but we'll see what ultimately they're able to get done.”",,,,2025-05-13 18:08:58.905969
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-13 21:45:15+00:00,Mississippi Today,Nearly 70 percent of Mississippi rural hospitals don’t deliver babies; new report shows trend is growing nationwide,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/13/rural-hospitals-labor-and-delivery/,"The growing epidemic of closures hasn’t affected Mississippi as much as other states in recent years – but most of Mississippi’s rural hospitals already don’t deliver babies, according to a report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.","Rural hospitals across the country are shuttering their labor and delivery doors, leaving millions of women – including Mississippians – without maternity care. 
The growing epidemic of closures hasn’t affected Mississippi as much as other states in recent years – but most of Mississippi’s rural hospitals already don’t deliver babies, according to a report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, an organization that focuses on solving health care problems by reforming insurance payments. 
Only one rural hospital in Mississippi closed its labor and delivery unit between 2021 and 2025, the report found. However, the vast majority – 68% – of rural hospitals in the state do not have a labor and delivery unit. Most of the 50 rural Mississippi hospitals not delivering babies never did, or stopped long ago, while four have closed their delivery services within the last 15 years. 
Now, the problem that has plagued Mississippi is spreading across the U.S., where nearly two rural hospitals each month have stopped delivering babies since the end of 2020, and more are announcing closures for 2025. That’s more than 100 rural hospitals in just under five years.
Addressing rural maternity care is key to mitigating maternal mortality in America – which continues to have the highest rate among high-income nations, the report’s authors argued. 
“Over 80% of pregnancy-related deaths are preventable with appropriate prenatal, labor & delivery, and post-partum care,” the report read. “Although improvements in maternity care are needed in all parts of the country to reduce mortality rates, one of the greatest challenges is in rural areas, because most rural hospitals are no longer providing maternity care at all.”
Across the country, less than half – 42% – of rural hospitals currently offer labor and delivery services. 
The study also looked at travel times to labor and delivery units for women using the distance from hospitals without labor and delivery services to hospitals with those services. It found that in most urban areas, the travel time to a hospital with labor and delivery services is under 20 minutes. In rural areas, women face travel times of at least 30 minutes, but often 50 minutes or more. 
At 35 minutes, Mississippi’s median travel time is similar to the country as a whole. 
The rural hospitals that have stopped delivering babies in Mississippi since 2010, according to data from the Mississippi State Department of Health, are: the south campus of Anderson Regional Medical Center in Meridian; the community campus of Merit Health Natchez; Magee General; and Greenwood Leflore.
Despite Meridian being one of Mississippi’s larger cities, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) defines it as rural. 
Authors of the study offered several recommendations to stakeholders, most of which centered around reforming payments to hospitals. 
One of the biggest challenges for small hospitals providing maternity care is that physicians and staff must be standing by 24 hours a day, but are only paid when they deliver a baby – even though rural hospitals may experience many days when there are no deliveries.Another problem with payment methods, according to the report, is that insurance companies often pay more for C-sections, meaning hospitals and clinicians that support natural childbirth may lose money – even though there have been national efforts to reduce C-section rates, which are highest in Mississippi. 
The report stressed that the biggest problem is not with Medicaid or uninsured patients. The primary cause of overall losses on patient services at rural maternity care hospitals is private insurance companies paying rural hospitals less than what it costs to deliver services to patients. 
“Rural maternity care is in a state of crisis, and more women and babies in rural communities will die unnecessarily until the crisis is resolved,” the report stated. “Federal and state government officials and private employers must take immediate action to ensure that all health insurance plans are paying adequately to support high-quality maternity care in every community.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06094914/pregnant-stomach-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-13 18:08:58.905969

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) LSU Provost Roy Haggerty is leaving the university to accept the same position at Oregon State, where he previously taught and served as a dean. 
The provost’s position is the highest ranking role on campus for an academic, in many instances second in command to the president.   
LSU President William Tate thanked Haggerty for his service in a campuswide email announcing his departure. Haggerty’s departure was confirmed to the Illuminator last month by LSU Board of Supervisors member Rémy Starns. 
Haggerty is the third high-ranking administrator to leave LSU this year. 
Before coming to LSU in 2022, Haggerty worked at Oregon State for 26 years as a professor and as dean of its College of Science. 
“Oregon is our community, and it is OSU’s responsibility to do everything we can to make it better,” Haggerty said in an Oregon State news release. “I can’t wait to join President Murthy and everyone at OSU to advance all of Oregon.”
Troy Blanchard, dean of LSU’s College of Humanities and Social Sciences will serve as interim provost and executive vice president effective May 19. 
According to Tate’s email, Haggerty will “continue to support LSU in an advisory role to the President and the Interim Executive Vice President and Provost.”

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)A West Virginia school district is hiring an attorney to sort out who has the authority to set school vaccination polices — is it the governor, the Legislature or the state health department? 
It’s the tip of the iceberg for legal questions and likely court challenges as county school boards and the state board of education are grappling with how to handle Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order mandating that public schools permit religious and philosophical exemptions to the state’s strict school immunization rules. 
The state’s vaccine laws remain unchanged after the GOP-led House of Delegates voted down a broad vaccine exemption bill, and other attempts to revive the legislation failed, as well. Lawmakers who voted down the measure cited constituents’ pleas for upholding vaccine laws during a wave of measles cases.
“I think we’re collateral damage,” said Ohio County School Board President David Croft, adding that the school district will have outside counsel determine before the end of the month if the state’s immunization laws or the executive order should take precedence. 
“Our goal, and I hope the rest of the state follows, is to understand that the issue is not if a single board member is or is not in favor of vaccinations. But it is trying to [do] their duties as a county board of education member appropriately by following West Virginia laws,” he said. 
Morrisey says that, regardless that the state immunization laws remain unchanged, public schools must comply with his executive order, citing a 2023 religious freedom law as its legal justification. 
While some private schools say they won’t comply, parents have already begun requesting a religious exemption to vaccine rules from the state health department.
“It’s a complex legal analysis that has to be done here,” said Croft, who is an attorney.
He said the analysis will have to look at kids’ constitutional rights to a safe education versus religious freedom, along with a disagreement between the executive and legislative branches of government. 
“Our goal at the end of the day is to put our kids in the best position we can — and our teachers,” Croft added. 
The issue is likely to end up before a judge ahead of next school year.
Croft noted that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which could preside over a possible challenge, already ruled in a 2011 lawsuit involving a Mingo County student that the state’s vaccines laws were constitutional and did not overly burden a parent’s right to free exercise of religion. 
Divided opinions on lawfulness of executive order 
  Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio
The push to edit the state’s vaccine laws has been spearheaded by Sen. Laura Chapman, R-Ohio. She was the lead sponsor of a bill earlier this year that would have allowed religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements and revised the existing medical exemption process. 
Chapman, a mother and attorney, said she wholeheartedly supports Morrisey’s executive order regarding religious exemptions.
“Gov. Morrisey’s executive action is well-grounded in law based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act, which protects against government discrimination against a sincerely held religious belief,” she said. 
Prior to the executive order, West Virginia was among five states that didn’t allow exemptions to school vaccine requirements based on religious or philosophical beliefs. State laws only allowed medical exemptions. 
“We are one of the most religious states in the nation and we unfortunately are lumped in with liberal states like California and New York,” Chapman said. “Each of our surrounding states offer a religious exemption and the [Centers for Disease Control] numbers are sub-herd immunity levels. There is no reason to believe West Virginia will be any different. Ultimately, a family should not be required to give up their religious beliefs in order to go to our fantastic public and private schools.”
  Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio
Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio, was among the House’s no votes on changing the state’s vaccine laws. The bill was voted down 42-56 in March.
“We elect public officials to pass public policy, we don’t elect kings and queens,” Fluharty said. “This session, public officials listened to their constituents, medical professionals and experts by rightfully voting down this bad public policy. It’s a shame the governor and his handlers want to circumvent this process.”
  Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha
On Wednesday, the West Virginia school board will discuss religion exemptions from school vaccinations, according to their agenda. 
State Schools Superintendent Michele Blatt earlier this month issued guidance to school superintendents recommending that students not be allowed to attend schools next year without the required vaccinations. She rescinded the memo at the request of Morrisey and is now working with the governor’s office to issue clear guidance to schools about how to comply with the executive order, according to her statement. 
Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha, has called on the state school board to maintain its current immunization requirements. He wrote a letter to the board on Tuesday, saying that Morrisey’s executive order conflicts with existing statutory law and oversteps constitutional authority.
Hollis wrote that the current vaccine law “protects the health and safety of West Virginia’s children, families and communities.”

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal)COLUMBUS, Ohio — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped by the Ohio Statehouse Tuesday to lend his support to imposing congressional term limits.
The effort would require a constitutional amendment, and Ohio’s resolution calls for a convention of the states to draft it. The approach has never been tried before and presents several unknowns — brushed aside by the Florida governor and Ohio lawmakers.
Ohio’s proposal isn’t even the only convention for which DeSantis is beating the drum. He was in Idaho about six weeks ago calling for a balanced budget amendment.
 Ready for ‘tough conversations’

Desantis’ visit comes amid a growing feud with Republicans in the Florida Legislature. The governor and state legislative leaders both want to cut taxes, but the governor wants to focus on property tax cuts while House Speaker Daniel Perez is eyeing the state sales tax. Florida is one of nine states with no income tax.
Perez criticized DeSantis for hopping on a private plane “paid for taxpayers by the way” when he could be hammering out a budget deal with Florida lawmakers.
“If he were to spend more time here in this Capitol having conversations with myself and other members of the House he’d understand my position — why we are in that position,” Perez said. “And if he’s able to convince us otherwise and have us move in another direction, maybe his direction, he has every opportunity to do so.”
He added the Florida House is ready for “tough conversations” while the governor is not.
“There’s no difference between him and any seventh grader in Miami-Dade County right now who tweets,” Perez said.
The last time DeSantis stopped by Ohio he was campaigning for then-U.S. Senate candidate J.D. Vance while not-so-subtly laying track for his own 2024 presidential campaign. On Tuesday, he insisted his visit “has nothing to do with running for anything.”
 Ohio’s convention proposal

Freshman state Rep. Heidi Workman is sponsoring the Ohio House Joint Resolution calling for a constitutional convention.
“Voters are tired of Washington politicians spending decades in office disconnected from the people they’re elected to serve,” Workman said. “They want change, and they’re looking for that change right now.”
DeSantis served three terms in Congress before running for governor, and said that experience left a mark.
“The incentives to do really good policy are just skewed away from that,” he said. “People get up there and basically, they’re told, ‘You got to pay your dues.’”
Workman pointed to polling — notably, conducted by the pro-term limits organization U.S. Term Limits — indicating 78% of Ohioans want to set a ceiling on congressional service.
“This is not a partisan issue — it is a people issue,” Workman argued. “Across Ohio and across the country, the demand for congressional term limits is strong and bipartisan.”
Twelve states that have so far advanced a joint resolution calling for a convention. Every single one of them is controlled by Republicans.
 Pitfalls

The problem with hosting a constitutional convention is that there’s little to restrain what the convention’s members decide to do. Article V of the U.S. Constitution is explicit on how you call a convention, but silent on what happens once delegates start debating.
To fill that void, two Ohio Republicans floated potential felony charges and a gag order to keep debates on track, as they considered a different constitutional convention proposal last year.
DeSantis dismissed concerns about a “runway” convention, putting his faith in the ratification process that would follow.
“It is the same no matter if Congress or the state proposes [an amendment],” DeSantis said. “It requires three-quarters of the states of this country, 38 states, to ratify an amendment to the Constitution. I don’t think 38 states are going to ratify the work of a, quote, runaway convention.”
He added there’s nothing stopping Ohio from allowing the governor to recall delegates or place other requirements on their activity.
Still, with DeSantis himself backing convention efforts for term limits and a balanced budget, it’s not hard to imagine a convention exceeding its initial mandate. Asked about those different interests, DeSantis argued both ideas could clear the required 34-state threshold before backtracking and suggesting Congress would likely step in to draft its own amendment if states got close.
“I do anticipate, in both instances, that you would likely force Congress to act prior to getting the 34 states — I just think practically that will happen,” DeSantis said. “But I’m also not somebody that believes somehow the states aren’t capable of proposing an amendment.”

But critics, including Scott, have argued the state lacks the charging infrastructure — among other preparations — necessary for such swift change.“I continue to believe we should be incentivizing Vermonters to transition to cleaner energy options like electric vehicles,” Scott said in a press release announcing his order. “However, we have to be realistic about a pace that’s achievable.”Scott’s order directs the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources not to take action against car manufacturers that fail to meet California’s regulations. If manufacturers want to be eligible for the pause, they must not impose the electric vehicle sale ratios on their dealerships, according to the order.  READ MORE

The Protect MI Care Coalition – which includes the Michigan State Medical Society, Michigan Health & Hospital Association and the Michigan League for Public Policy – sent a letter to all 13 of Michigan’s members of Congress outlining their “deep opposition” to a spending plan as proposed by House Republicans. The proposal  would slash at least $880 billion over the next 10 years from the bill that covers energy and health care, including from Medicaid. 
“These cuts would devastate Michigan’s health care system, put the lives and livelihoods of millions at risk, and reverse years of progress in improving health outcomes across our state,” the letter said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The proposal unveiled on May 11 would strip health care coverage from up to 512,000 Michiganders through punitive work requirements, restrict support for nursing homes and hospitals, and drain billions in federal funding from our state, especially in rural and underserved communities that already face barriers to care. Medicaid is not a luxury. It is a lifeline,” the coalition said.
Both U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) and U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) sit on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which began debate on the budget plan Tuesday.
Dingell, in her opening statement, noted 2.6 million people get their health insurance through Medicaid in Michigan, representing approximately one in four Michiganders, two in five children, three in five nursing home residents, and three in eight working age adults with disabilities. 
“To all my colleagues who say you’re cutting waste and fraud, Medicaid is 22%, more cost-effective than any private insurance plan. We have to protect…children and seniors and nursing homes and people with disabilities, and please don’t say you’re not going to hurt them, because many things in this bill are a backdoor way of doing so,” Dingell said.

James, who did not offer an opening statement, has stated in the past that Republicans are working to protect Medicaid from insolvency to “ensure those who’ve rightfully paid into their benefits & our most vulnerable can access these essential programs.”
Just prior to the committee hearing Tuesday, estimates were released from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicating that as written, the GOP bill would result in 7.6 million people going uninsured, while 10.3 million people would lose coverage under Medicaid’s health safety net program, a collaboration between Medicaid and various federal grant programs that support healthcare providers.

Kevin Stitt’s veto of a bill that would provide Oklahomans more recourse in pursuing open records has drawn the ire of the state’s attorney general.
Stitt vetoed House Bill 2163 that would have formally created a Public Access Counselor Unit in Drummond’s office and a deadline-laden process to help those seeking public records. The measure would allow for a person to request a review from the access counselor, who will then determine if the denial violated state law and advise the public body.
The government body must then promptly and reasonably comply. 
“Oklahomans have several effective tools to ensure transparency and accountability in government,” Stitt’s veto message said. “Public records laws and the courts provide a neutral, fair process to review and resolve disputes over access to information. This bill bypasses that process and concentrates too much power in one office.”
Attorney General Gentner Drummond criticized the veto, saying Stitt didn’t want  him to have increased authority and the ability to hold the governor and his “failed political appointees” accountable for not following the law.
“As Attorney General, I serve the people of Oklahoma, not bureaucrats or politicians,” Drummond said. “My client is the state of Oklahoma, not powerful insiders or special-interest groups.”
He said the veto would not stop him from upholding the law and fulfilling his duty to Oklahomans.
In 2023, Drummond announced he had hired former Republican State Senator Anthony Sykes as his public access counselor to help  resolve disputes over open records.
Sykes has received 354 complaints and resolved 302, said Leslie Berger, a Drummond spokeswoman. His salary is $99,225, she said.
A request submitted in 2024 by Oklahoma Voice to Sykes for assistance in obtaining unredacted flight logs from the Oklahoma Department of Transportation has yet to receive a response.
A 2024 Oklahoma Voice investigation found that the names of people on trips Stitt and others took on a state plane were redacted and did not list a purpose for the trip, which experts said appeared contrary to state law.
Rep. John Pfeiffer, R-Orlando, the House author, said he is considering a veto override attempt.
He said he was frustrated by the veto, adding that he has spent years trying to get the measure passed.
“It seems that this is more of a political thing – an ongoing tiff between the attorney general and governor,” Pfeiffer said.
The two Republicans have been at odds over a number of issues. The measure passed the House by a vote of 80-9 and the Senate by a vote of 40-5.
A veto override would take three-fourths votes in both chambers because the bill has an emergency clause. 
Measures without an emergency clause take two-thirds votes in both chambers.

Cindy Holscher, left, and Sen. Doug Shane considered submissions from the public as part of Tuesday's Senate Committee on Government Efficiency meeting. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — The Kansas Senate Committee on Government Efficiency dug through hundreds of online submissions Tuesday and set an agenda for the coming months tackling issues from transparency to auditing.
The meeting agenda, released Monday, said committee members would discuss suggestions received through the COGE portal, where Kansans were encouraged to share ideas to make the government more efficient. 
Erickson said 3,254 submissions were made to date, with topics ranging from specific ideas about government efficiency to people who were venting frustrations. There also were a few recipes, she said. 
She has read all the submissions and with the help of committee staff had winnowed the number for consideration to 349 “COGE-like submissions,” Erickson said.
The committee agreed that submissions that might not fit the COGE mission could be passed along to state agencies or others who could address the issues. 
“How are we going to carve this bird today? That’s the $64,000 question. There are submissions that deal with local and federal,” Erickson said. “Our focus is not to deal with those one-offs that I would call more constituent services, someone who has a specific issue. But are there patterns?”
Setting aside those that didn’t fall into the COGE focus left the committee with 349 submissions to consider. Erickson stressed that all committee members have access to the 3,000-plus submissions received and could add topics at any time.
“Identify tangible ideas,” she said. “We want to look for things that are possibilities to take up during our next legislative session. You can start to see some themes, some natural groupings.”
To get an idea of the time involved and how to best work through the emails, the committee took about 30 minutes to look through 40 pages of submissions and then began discussions of what issues might be appropriate for COGE to consider. Eventually, they considered all 349 submissions.
The result? The committee will discuss the following broad topics in order of importance: 

Transparency and ease of access
Agency workflow and interagency cooperation
Impact of third-party vendors, professional organizations and other non-government entities
Auditing process/auditing environment
State budgeting and expenditure practices
Cost and access of medical care
Procurement

As the committee reached agreement on overall categories to explore, members also looked at what would put teeth into what they’re doing. 
“We’ve got to identify it, and we’ve got to rectify it,” Erickson said. She also said she’d like to consider how to incentivize state agencies to become more efficient.

Sen. Larry Alley, R-Winfield, said the committee needs to consider how to enforce its work. 
“If we don’t put some type of penalty in there — and usually the agencies or the other groups don’t respond unless It’s taking care of their money — if you penalize them in some way for not doing their job, then they will correct it,” he said. “But if you don’t, they’re not going to correct it.You need some teeth, and that teeth usually goes with what we only have up here and that’s the only thing we have, is a budget process of money.”
Erickson agreed that accountability will be a factor in the committee’s work. 
“What would that look like as we identify efficiencies or waste? What was the term someone used, identify and rectify? I like that,” she said. “What does that rectify part look like to me? That’s the accountability, the teeth that we’re talking about.”
Sen. Doug Shane, a Louisburg Republican, said accountability could look like training. 
“We tie in whatever the legislative expectations are, as far as monitoring for waste and bloat or what have you, and come up with some very clear legislative guidelines, statutory guidelines that if they aren’t followed, that maybe the quote, unquote punishment is we’re going to be trained on efficient and ethical spending of taxpayer funds,” he said.
The committee agreed it would start in June by digging into the top two priorities with three agencies: the Kansas Department for Children and Families; the Kansas judicial branch, including include local sheriffs and other law enforcement agencies; and the Kansas Department of Labor.
Sen. Mike Thompson,  a Johnson County Republican, said he wants the agencies to bring ideas on creating efficiencies. 
“I don’t want the agency to come and tell us why they can’t do something,” he said. “I want them to come with ideas, and I think that needs to be our big focus.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shane-and-Holscher-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-13 18:08:58.905969

While the state announced a grant for installing solar energy on affordable housing units, U.S. House Republicans worked to shred the funding that made the Vermont program possible.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Solar for All distributes more than $22 million in funding but remains under threat.","Michael Regan, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, center, spoke about a new $7 billion Solar for All grant competition to fund residential solar programs at a press conference at SunCommon in Waterbury on June 28, 2023. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIn Washington, D.C., House Republicans plan to gather Tuesday to vote on whether to shred the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark law that has issued hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy incentives since 2022, as part of President Donald Trump’s new budget proposal.Meanwhile, in Vermont on Tuesday morning, a state program funded by that very law announced more than $22 million of the state’s total grant of $62.5 million would go to help install solar power on low-income housing in the state.“Currently towns with the highest energy burden in Vermont have the least amount of installed solar,” Kerrick Johnson, commissioner for the Department of Public Service, which controls the state’s grant, said in a statement. “That’s why the primary objective of this program is to deliver benefits to disadvantaged Vermonters, regardless of their dwelling status.”The funding is part of the Solar for All program, a $7 billion national initiative to lower the cost of electricity by installing solar on buildings and developing solar arrays in communities. Across the country, the program could pass on solar benefits to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office that administered the grant to 49 states and six tribes, among others.Vermont’s congressional delegation championed the initiative, including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who introduced Solar for All into the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).But funding for the solar program has been under threat before by the Trump administration, and it could be under threat again as the Republican-dominated Congress moves to axe programs from the IRA to achieve the multi-trillion-dollar budget President Trump is calling “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.”On Sunday, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce committee proposed to meet the budget goals by repealing grants from a $27 billion IRA program called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which aims to lower carbon emissions. One of the three programs in that fund is the Solar for All program.READ MORE
“Donald Trump campaigned on lowering electric bills for working Americans. As president, he’s doing exactly the opposite,” Sanders said in an email Tuesday. “The disastrous reconciliation bill being pushed by Trump and Congressional Republicans would not only make electric bills more expensive for Vermonters, it would make the climate crisis worse.”Sanders said the good news was that the budget bill couldn’t legally rescind Vermont’s $62.5 million grant that was allocated to the Vermont Department of Public Service.“The bad news is that Trump does not respect the Constitution or rule of law,” Sanders said. “I will continue to do everything I can to make sure Solar for All funding is deployed to lower electric bills, slash carbon emissions, and create thousands of good jobs.”The road to how the federal government got to this massive repeal process began in January, when Trump took office and issued a flurry of executive orders. Those included Unleashing American Energy, which called for a 90-day freeze on IRA funds. A letter sent a week later by the EPA notified Solar for All recipients that the hundred of millions of dollars they’d received so far was paused until further notice. Programs across the country, including New Mexico, Tennessee and Wisconsin, were suddenly unable to access their grant funding and proceed with solar projects that require significant upfront investment.The solar array at Crossest Brook Middle School in Duxbury on Aug. 25, 2021. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“While the federal funding landscape is dynamic, we have a binding agreement with EPA and the funding is obligated,” said Randy Brittingham, grant program manager at the state energy office for the Vermont Department of Public Service, in an email. After a pause in communication and access to funds this winter, Brittingham said the state is back in regular contact with the EPA. “We’ve successfully drawn funding for this program since that February pause,” he said.But Lee Zeldin, the new EPA administrator, has gone further since February, claiming in March that President Joe Biden’s administration had doled out billions of dollars that were vulnerable to “waste, fraud, and abuse.” Zeldin tried to claw back $20 billion from the two other programs in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and while caught up in court battles, those funds largely remain frozen. While Zeldin’s ire wasn’t aimed at Solar for All, his attack launched an audit into the program by the EPA Office of Inspector General. The audit is ongoing, according to Kim Wheeler, director of strategic communications for that office.“Solar for All was selected because it is a $7 billion program with a financing structure that is new and different for the EPA, with $25 million already spent,” Wheeler said in an email on Tuesday. She did not respond by the time of publication to a question about whether the EPA considers only $25 million of the program obligated.While Wheeler said her office doesn’t have the authority to make or revoke funding decisions, if her office found an issue with an award during an investigation, it could make recommendations to the EPA.“If we identified an issue during an audit (such as the project you are asking about), we could recommend that the Agency evaluate whether to suspend payment or terminate the award,” Wheeler said of the Solar for All program.Until the investigation is concluded, Solar for All funding will continue to trickle down to Vermonters. More than a third of the $62.5 million grant was awarded this week to the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, a quasi-public entity that acts like a bank for affordable housing, to make solar more accessible for low-income households.These funds – called Multi Family Affordable Housing – will be awarded  to new developers for affordable housing projects like multi-family apartment buildings, largely benefitting renters. Separate programs that fall under the state’s Solar for All program push benefits toward single-family homeowners and community solar projects. “We know that renters have been very underserved by solar resources in the past, so it’s exciting for us as a housing funder to help developers successfully electrify their buildings and rely less on fossil fuels,” said Mia Watson, special programs manager for the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, who is supporting the Solar for All award.Tenants who have an electric bill could see at least 20% in bill savings and tenants without an electric bill would receive an equivalent benefit, Brittingham said. He added that all residents would benefit from the climate impacts of growing Vermont’s solar generation.Residents and developers can attend public outreach sessions hosted by the finance agency in the coming months. The finance agency in partnership with the state will submit a work plan for EPA approval by December. They expect to award funds to developers early next year.“We’re still cautious about what may happen at the federal level, but so far the indications we have are good that this program is going to happen,” Watson said. “We’ve had strong support from the state and our congressional delegation, especially Sen. Sanders, but I think everyone involved is a little concerned that things could change unexpectedly.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Solar for All distributes more than $22 million in funding but remains under threat.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/solar-for-all-1-20230628.jpg,,,2025-05-13 18:08:58.905969

Dan McKee’s proposed raises for 11 cabinet members on Tuesday, May 13, 2025. (Screenshot/Capitol TV)One way to unite state lawmakers across the political divide: Give them a common cause.
In this case, defeating Gov. Dan McKee’s pitch to raise salaries for 11 of his department heads.
The Rhode Island House of Representatives voted unanimously Tuesday in a 68-0 vote to reject McKee’s proposed cabinet raises, marking the first time on record that the legislature has exercised its statutory authority to veto executive salary hikes. 
State law specifies that annual raises pitched by the governor automatically take effect within 30 days, unless the legislature acts to stop them through a joint, concurrent resolution which must pass through both chambers.
McKee wrote to the Rhode Island General Assembly notifying them of his proposed raises on April 18, giving the legislature till May 18 to make a move. The Rhode Island Senate has not scheduled a vote as of Tuesday, with leaders still discussing the proposal, Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson said. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, who sponsored the resolution to stop the salary increases, made it clear when McKee unveiled the combined $82,000 worth of salary increases in March that he had reservations about doling out raises in cash-strapped times. The state is facing a projected $190 million deficit for fiscal 2026, alongside threats of potentially devastating cuts to federal funding.
House Majority Leader Christopher Blazejewski also said prudence was needed in explaining the bill on the floor Tuesday.
“This is not a reflection of any one particular director but has more to do with the financial circumstances at this time,” Blazejewski, a Providence Democrat, said.
The 68-o vote came swiftly. The only lawmaker who commented prior to the vote was Rep. Charlene Lima, a Cranston Democrat.
“I don’t think people should be getting raises at this time,” Lima said.
McKee, however, has defended the salary bumps as necessary to keep pay competitive with other states and the private sector.
Nine cabinet members would receive 5% raises effective May 18 if the Senate fails to vote on the resolution before then. They are the head of the Departments of Administration; Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals; Business Regulation; Children, Youth and Families; Corrections; Environmental Management; Human Services; Labor and Training, and Revenue. 
The Department of Transportation director would get a 2% raise while the Rhode Island State Police superintendent, who also serves as director of the Department of Public Safety, is in line for a 0.5% raise.
Absent from the vote Tuesday were representatives Mia Ackerman, a Cumberland Democrat; Stephen Casey, a Woonsocket Democrat; Marie Hopkins, a Warwick Republican; Brian Kennedy, a Hopkinton Democrat; and William O’Brien, a North Providence Democrat.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Several Oklahoma civil rights groups on Tuesday filed an amended lawsuit seeking to block the enforcement of a controversial anti-immigration law after they said state officials have been allowed to enforce it.
The latest legal wrangling comes after the U.S. Department of Justice in March dropped its objections to the implementation of House Bill 4156, which created the crime of “impermissible occupation” for undocumented immigrants in the state.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, the National Immigration Law Center, Padres Unidos de Tulsa and the League of United Latin American Citizens Oklahoma City chapter, Barbara Boe and Christopher Coe filed the amended lawsuit on behalf of undocumented immigrants living in the state. 
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond and Commissioner of Public Safety Tim Tipton are among those named as defendants.
“We are fighting once more against this harmful law, which the court already enjoined last year as unconstitutional” said Noor Zafar, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, in a statement. “Every day that HB 4156 is in effect, it puts immigrants in Oklahoma at risk of arrest, detention, and banishment from the state and undermines the federal immigration system that Congress set up. We are using every legal tool available to stop this law from tearing apart communities across Oklahoma.” 
First-time violators of the law, signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt in April 2024, face up to a year in jail and a fine up to $500, or both, and the person must leave the state within 72 hours. A second offense is punishable by two years in prison, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.
Several of these groups and the U.S. Department of Justice, which was led by former President Joe Biden’s administration, had separately sued last year to stop it from taking effect. The suits, filed in the Western District of Oklahoma, were combined. 
A federal judge then put the law on hold ahead of its July 1, 2024, implementation. Opponents argued that federal authorities are responsible for enforcing immigration.
In March, the Department of Justice, led by President Donald Trump, announced that it no longer objected to the law and dismissed the case. 
The groups argued Tuesday that the state officials have “unprecedented power to arrest, detain, and expel noncitizens,” by creating a “novel system” with immigration crimes completely outside the federal system. 
“For far too long, Oklahoma law enforcement was stymied because the federal government had declined to do anything about deporting illegal immigrants found working at illegal marijuana grows,” said Carrie Burkhart, a spokesperson for Drummond, in a statement. “Enforcing HB4156 ensures the safety and security of Oklahomans, and our office will vigorously defend it.”
A bill proposed this session, House Bill 1362, would have repealed this law, but did not advance from a Senate committee. It would have allowed an individual to be arrested and charged with a new felony punishable by five years in prison if they are apprehended for a violation of Oklahoma’s criminal law and are determined to be an undocumented immigrant. But they could agree to be returned to their country of origin by federal immigration enforcement rather than be imprisoned if they have no other felony charges or previous convictions for a violent offense.

The land purchase — said to be one of the largest carried out by the state in recent years — was completed by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for $4.1 million, according to a press release. 
The agency said it plans to add the property to its list of of more than 100 wildlife management areas that are open to the public. No name had been chosen for the site as of Tuesday.
“This acquisition is a landmark achievement for environmental conservation in Connecticut,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in a statement. “The new wildlife management area will not only protect vital ecosystems and water resources but also provide a serene space for the public to connect with nature through activities like wildlife watching and fishing.” 
A spokesman for the agency said Tuesday that officials also plan to permit some hunting, pending a formal assessment of the property. 
The property includes the 41-acre Lake Albert and three smaller lakes, as well as areas of forest and wetlands that are home to a “rich array of plant and animal species,” according to DEEP. 
A listing on Zillow from January advertises the property for its “absolute peace, quiet and security with no public access.” The original listing price was $5.9 million.
The seller, Watertown developer Mark Greenberg, said he purchased the property in 1989 without any firm ideas of what he wanted to do with it. Later, he said he got local approval to build a sub-development of over 100 homes, only to find the cost of building the necessary roads and other infrastructure too prohibitive.
“Looking back, I wish I had not purchased it, it was not a good purchase for me,” he said.
After putting the property up for sale, Greenberg said the state reached out eight or nine months ago with a strong interest in purchasing the land, which he called a “wonderful” spot for its natural amenities. Ultimately, he said DEEP agreed to purchase the land for its appraisal price. 
James Fowler, the DEEP spokesman, said Tuesday that the property had not previously been designated as open space and that its preservation “represents meaningful progress” toward achieving the state’s goal of setting aside 21% of its land — about 673,210 acres — as open space.
By law, that goal was supposed to have been reached by 2023. As of that year, however, DEEP reported it was only three-quarters of the way along.
According to CT Insider, the sale amounted to the single largest conveyance of land in Connecticut over the last three years — beating out an estate in Cornwall that was purchased last year.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tri-Lakes-2.jpg.jpeg,,,2025-05-13 18:08:58.905969

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)There’s no reason why money for road repairs and flood protections should hinge upon states’ cooperation with federal immigration policies, contend 20 Democratic states attorneys general.
That’s why the AGs, including New Jersey’s Matt Platkin, are asking a federal judge to stop federal agencies from a “grant funding hostage scheme” that requires detaining undocumented immigrants who don’t commit crimes in order to receive key federal grants and aid.
Two new federal lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) aim to protect and preserve billions of federal dollars already awarded to states for emergency preparedness, disaster relief and infrastructure projects.
Directives issued in April by DHS and DOT secretaries informed states that their federal funding required compliance with federal immigration policies. The AGs — representing Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Vermont — allege this violated constitutional protections for separation of powers.
“By hanging a halt in this critical funding over States like a sword of Damocles, Defendants impose immense harm on States, forcing them to choose between readiness for disasters and emergencies, on the one hand, and their judgment about how best to investigate and prosecute crimes, on the other,” the lawsuit against DHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Coast Guard, and their leaders, states.
“Defendants’ grant funding hostage scheme violates two key principles that underlie the American system of checks and balances: agencies in the Executive Branch cannot act contrary to the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government cannot use the spending power to coerce States into adopting its preferred policies. Defendants have ignored both principles, claiming undelegated power to place their own conditions on dozens of grant programs that Congress created and bulldozing through the Constitution’s boundary between state and federal authority.”
The AGs say state and local public safety officials have more important work to do than cater to the whims of a new administration, which stand in contradiction to state-level directives like, for example, authorizing licenses for undocumented immigrants. Rhode Island lawmakers granted driving privileges for undocumented residents in 2022, with a July, 1 2023 effective date, joining 19 other states and D.C.
Federal protocols followed by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies could force state and local police to use state license laws as a way to find and detain undocumented immigrants.
“As a former U.S. Attorney and former federal prosecutor, I know how many ICE agents are in Rhode Island and it’s under 10,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said during a virtual press conference Tuesday. “What they need in order to carry out their agenda is for us to do the work for them, pulling us away from important law enforcement work in Rhode Island.”

More uncertainty for Washington Bridge
No state has seen federal funding cut off since directives were issued by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Not yet.
States’ abilities to respond to natural disasters and security threats, and complete key infrastructure projects, including the much-anticipated rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge in Rhode Island, hinge upon a continued flow of congressionally authorized federal grants and aid.
The $221 million Biden-era infrastructure grant awarded to Rhode Island for the Washington Bridge project only became accessible in late March, after weeks of uncertainty in the wake of the administration change. Gov. Dan McKee’s office and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday regarding continued access to the funds in the wake of Duffy’s April 24 directive tying federal infrastructure grants to compliance with federal diversity and immigration policies.
The Duffy directive fails to provide any statutory or legal explanation for why transportation funding relates to immigration enforcement. The new requirements  jeopardize more than $628 million in federal funding in Rhode Island, and billions of dollars more across the country, the AGs argue in their lawsuit against Duffy and DOT.
“If Plaintiff States reject Defendants’ unlawful Immigration Enforcement Condition, they will collectively lose billions in federal funding that is essential to sustain critical public safety and transportation programs, including highway development, airport safety projects, protections against train collisions, and programs to prevent injuries and deaths from traffic accidents. The loss of this funding will cause state and local providers to scale back or even terminate many of these programs and projects,” the complaint states. “More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States.”










More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States.


– Twenty state Democratic AGs in lawsuit against U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy


Similarly dire predictions accompany the loss of security and disaster funds, which includes $3 billion in FEMA money to states each year, according to the lawsuit against DHS. Rhode Island received more than $45 million in FEMA grants in 2024 alone, according to the lawsuit.
The new complaints reprise language of the 20 state AG lawsuits against the Trump administration that preceded them, calling the executive agencies’ actions “arbitrary and capricious” and in clear violation of constitutional separation of powers and spending clauses.
Neronha during the press conference pointed to the success that AGs have had in other lawsuits, temporarily preserving funding and policy protections for education, immigration, research funding, public health, and grants and aid to state governments, among others.
Not that he expects the frenzy of legal activity will abate anytime soon.
“As we stack wins against the Trump administration for violation of the Constitution and other federal laws, what we are seeing is a creeping authoritarianism in this country,” Neronha said. “The president is trying to take power for himself. He’s trying to sideline Congress, and now, he’s attempting to undermine the judiciary.”
Neronha likened the latest federal directives attempting to force states to redirect their own law enforcement to serve federal civil immigration policies to “holding a gun to states’ heads.”
Rhode Island, home to four of the 20 federal lawsuits against the Trump administration already, was again picked as the setting for the latest complaints due to the “strong team” within Neronha’s office, he said.
Neronha and other AGs bringing the two cases against the administration also stressed the sum of their collaborative parts.
“We’ve built the best and biggest law firm in the country, and we’re fighting for all Americans,” Neronha said.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
The lawsuit against DOT was assigned to U.S. District Chief Judge John Jr. McConnell Jr., while the case against DHS was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith, according to the public court docket.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An emergency one-time appropriation of $27.4 million is needed for the Oklahoma mental health department to make it through the current fiscal year and pay its employees, according to an official request made public Tuesday. 
The amount the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services needs to stay afloat is slightly more than four times what agency leaders had initially told lawmakers they’d need to address financial shortfalls. After the agency reported it wouldn’t be able to make payroll beginning May 21, the request grew to $23 million from the initial $6.2 million.
The state’s chief financial officer and a specially appointed financial expert arrived at the $27.4 million figure after reviewing the budget, and that figure will be the agency’s official request.
Sen. Chuck Hall, R-Perry, Senate appropriations chair, said this request should cover the expenditures listed in the report, which includes nearly $3.4 million in payroll, $16 million in promised outcome-based payments for providers, and a handful of other line items. 
The agency is projected to have over $116.6 million in cash and revenue for the rest of the fiscal year, but will expend about $144 million, according to the request shared with Oklahoma Voice. Some of these expenditures are “directed spending” mandated by the Legislature and require money to be sent to certain programs and funds, like one for children in crisis. 
Rep. John Kane, R-Bartlesville, vice chair of the House budget committee, said he has “no doubt” the Legislature will provide this emergency budget ask because “nobody wants to not pay our people.” House leaders have previously said the priority is paying state employees.
Aaron Morris, CFO for the state of Oklahoma, on Monday told lawmakers the request would not include funds for some payments to providers, who are seeking reimbursement by the state agency for services provided to uninsured populations. Despite reports from some providers of needing over $84 million in reimbursements this budget year, the request does not have a line item for these payments. 
“I think it’s an emergency. We’re gonna have to fund it for sure and get them on track,” Kane said. “And hopefully next year, when we start talking about a budget, we really are comfortable with where we are, and I think we can do it, no doubt.” 
He said the agency has not yet made an updated request for the upcoming budget year, which begins July 1. 
“And I don’t know where we’ll be on this year’s budget. I think we’re going to be a little bit of a shot in the dark,” Kane said. “And then I suspect that the governor will be monitoring that pretty closely, since it is an executive function at that point, and then see how they go through the year. That might be something we’re talking about in February, right when we get back.” 
The Legislature has until the last Friday in May to approve a budget. 
The appropriation will have to come through a joint committee on appropriations and budget, which Kane said is normally a five day process.

,DC,2025-05-13 21:00:40+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Amid protests and Democratic pushback, U.S. House GOP launches work on Medicaid cuts",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/amid-protests-and-democratic-pushback-us-house-gop-launches-work-medicaid-cuts,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House committee tasked with overhauling energy policy and Medicaid to achieve $880 billion in spending cuts on Tuesday began what was expected to be a long, grueling session with debate on dozens of amendments.Republicans on the panel argued during opening statements the proposed changes are necessary to realign several programs with President Donald Trump’s campaign promises and some long-standing GOP policy goals, primarily an extension of the 2017 tax cuts.Democrats contend the legislation, one of 11 measures that will make up the GOP’s “big, beautiful bill,” would kick millions of people out of Medicaid, the state-federal program for lower income Americans, some people with disabilities and a considerable number of nursing home patients.Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., said the GOP bill is aimed at reducing waste, fraud and abuse within Medicaid “by beginning to rein in the loopholes, by ensuring states have the flexibility to remove ineligible recipients from their roles and removing beneficiaries who enrolled in multiple states.”“We make no apologies for prioritizing Americans in need over illegal immigrants and those who are capable but choose not to work,” Guthrie said. “Our priority remains the same: strengthen and sustain Medicaid for those whom the program was intended to serve — expectant mothers, children, people with disabilities and the elderly.”Democratic New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, ranking member on the panel, rejected comments that the GOP bill was “moderate” and said it clearly was not aimed at addressing waste, fraud and abuse.“Medicaid is a life-saving program that 80 million Americans count on every day,” Pallone said. “It provides health care to 1 in 3 Americans and nearly half of all children in the United States. It covers close to half of all births. And it's the largest source of funding for long-term care for seniors and people living with disabilities. With this bill, Republicans are essentially telling millions of Americans, 'Gotcha, no more health care for you.'”Pallone added that Republican lawmakers were “intentionally taking health care away from millions of Americans, so they can give giant tax breaks to the ultra-rich, who frankly don't need them.”Just before Pallone spoke, several protesters in the room, including at least three people in wheelchairs, began chanting “No cuts to Medicaid” and were led out by U.S. Capitol Police, who charged 25 people with illegally demonstrating in the Rayburn House Office Building.Photos of constituentsDemocrats gave numerous opening statements at the start of the markup, each holding up a large photograph of one of their constituents on Medicaid and sharing stories of how the program helped them get or keep access to health care after complex diagnoses, like congestive heart failure, leukemia and cerebral palsy.Democratic lawmakers expressed concern those people would lose access to the health care program if the GOP bill becomes law.“You don’t just gut the largest insurer of low income Americans without real harm,” said Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly. “Call it what it is — abandonment, disinvestment and pure disregard for human life.”Florida Republican Rep. Kat Cammack rebuked some of the Democrats’ comments, which she said sought to fearmonger and lie to people about what was in the GOP bill.“The posters that our colleagues on the left have held up are touching. The stories, they're very emotional. And I agree that we want to protect those most vulnerable,” Cammack said. “As a pregnant woman, I want to make sure that pregnant women, expectant mothers have access to resources around the country.”Cammack added that “not a single person in those posters is going to be impacted by this legislation.”Floor action as soon as next weekRepublicans have already approved eight of the reconciliation bills in committee and are scheduled to wrap up work on the remaining three measures this week. The Ways and Means Committee began debating the tax bill shortly after Energy and Commerce began its markup, and the Agriculture panel was scheduled to begin its debate Tuesday evening.Later this week, the House Budget Committee plans to bundle all 11 bills together and send the full package to the floor. The entire House is set to vote on the legislation before Memorial Day.GOP leaders cannot afford much disagreement over the entire package, given their paper-thin majority in the House. If all of the current members are present at the vote, just three Republicans can oppose the package and still have it pass.The same margin exists in the Senate, which is expected to make substantial changes to the package should the House approve the measure and send it across the Capitol.$880 billion cutThe Energy and Commerce Committee’s bill up for debate Tuesday met the panel’s goal of cutting at least $880 billion in federal spending during the next decade, according to a letter from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Congress’ official scorekeepers, however, hadn’t released their full analysis of the panel’s bill before the start of the debate and amendment process, known in Congress as a markup.Once those details are made public, lawmakers and the voters who elected them will have a much more detailed look at how each of the proposed changes will affect federal revenue, spending and the number of people who could lose access to Medicaid.Democrats released a CBO analysis last week showing the impact of various proposals, though Energy and Commerce GOP staff cautioned Monday during a background briefing that what they proposed in the actual bill didn’t completely align with those scenarios.The bill would make considerable changes to Medicaid if the House and Senate approve the legislation as written, which seems highly unlikely, given objections from several GOP senators, including Missouri’s Josh Hawley.The House legislation would require able-bodied people between the ages of 19 and 65 to work, participate in community service, or attend an education program for at least 80 hours a month. There would be exceptions for pregnant people, Medicaid enrollees with dependent children and people with complex medical issues, among other exclusions.That provision would take effect on Jan. 1, 2029, according to an explainer on the bill from nonpartisan health research organization KFF.States would be required to check eligibility for all Medicaid patients every six months, lowering the threshold from one year for people eligible for the program under the expansion in the 2010 Affordable Care Act. That would need to begin by Oct. 1, 2027.Republicans are seeking to get the 12 states that allow immigrants without legal status into their Medicaid programs to change course by lowering the percent the federal government pays for those states’ expansion population enrollees from 90% to 80%. That would take effect Oct. 1, 2027.The legislation seeks to block Medicaid funding for a narrow subset of health care providers who offer abortion services, which appeared to target Planned Parenthood.The prohibition would apply to “providers that are nonprofit organizations, that are essential community providers that are primarily engaged in family planning services or reproductive services, provide for abortions other than for Hyde Amendment exceptions, and which received $1,000,000 or more (to either the provider or the provider’s affiliates) in payments from Medicaid payments in 2024,” according to a summary of the GOP bill. It would take effect as soon as the bill becomes law and last for a decade.The Hyde Amendment allows federal funding for abortions that are the result of rape, or incest, or that endanger the life of the pregnant patient.Planned Parenthood, SBA Pro-Life reactPlanned Parenthood Action Fund President and CEO Alexis McGill wrote in a statement that defunding the organization and overhauling Medicaid would mean that ""cancers will go undetected; it will be harder than ever to get birth control; the nation’s (sexually transmitted infection) crisis will worsen; Planned Parenthood health centers will close, making it significantly harder to get abortion care; and people across the country will suffer — all so the supremely wealthy can become even richer.”SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser applauded the potential change to federal funding.“It’s time to stop forcing taxpayers to fund the Big Abortion industry. Thanks to Speaker (Mike) Johnson and Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, this year’s budget reconciliation bill contains the commonsense language to make that happen,” Dannenfelser wrote. “Taxpayers should never be mandated to prop up an industry that profits from ending lives and harming women and girls.”More than 80 organizations, including the National Women’s Law Center and the Center for Reproductive Rights, wrote in a letter to congressional leaders that cutting off Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood “would be catastrophic, shutting down health centers and stripping millions of patients across the country of access to essential and affordable health care.”“In many communities, Planned Parenthood health centers are the only affordable provider with expertise in sexual and reproductive health,” the organizations wrote. “For those communities, the gap left by Planned Parenthood health centers would mean that many patients would have nowhere to turn for care.”President of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Stella Dantas wrote in a statement the GOP’s changes to Medicaid might create challenges for pregnant patients seeking to access care and that some states may roll back their expansion of postpartum coverage from a full year.“Pregnant patients who keep their coverage under Medicaid will still face challenges accessing care as labor and delivery unit closures escalate as a result of Medicaid cuts, leaving patients to travel longer distances to give birth,” Dantas wrote. “Ob-gyns are also concerned that the cuts will threaten the 12 months of postpartum coverage that we have fought so hard to achieve, and which will leave so many without access to medical care during the year after delivery when two-thirds of maternal deaths occur.“Backsliding on our recent progress in increasing access to postpartum coverage puts lives at risk.”American Public Health Association Executive Director Georges Benjamin wrote in a statement that House Republicans’ planned overhaul of Medicaid “does nothing to improve public health.”“Instead, it would undermine much of the progress we have made to expand access to affordable, quality health insurance and implement other evidence-based measures to protect the public’s health,” Benjamin wrote. “We urge the House to reject this bill and instead work in a bipartisan manner on legislation to improve public health and expand access to health care for all Americans.”",,,,2025-05-13 17:07:47.297892
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-13 20:59:46+00:00,CT Mirror,No CT homeschool regulation changes in omnibus education bill,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/13/ct-education-bill-homeschool/,A bill that passed the House was notable for what it did not address: A report that found CT has ‘no meaningful regulation of homeschooling.’,"The General Assembly merged disparate education issues into one omnibus bill Tuesday that, among other things, once again extends a deadline for addressing racial imbalances in schools, temporarily tweaks the age to begin kindergarten, sets standards for school crisis drills and encourages students to study civics.
The amended bill that passed the House on a 128-20 vote also is noteworthy for it did not address: A recent report by the Office of the Child Advocate concluding that Connecticut is one of a dozen states with “no meaningful regulation of homeschooling.”
An informational hearing about the report had raised alarms from the families of homeschooled children, who thronged to the state Capitol to oppose more stringent standards and oversight earlier this month. But Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Education Committee, said no bill would be attempted this year.
The hearing was called to identify “where there are gaps in the system,” she said.
“Now we’re going to do the public and methodical work to explore all those places where kids are slipping through and see what we can do next session to ensure all the children in Connecticut are safe,” Leeper said.
The report and discussion occurred after a widely publicized case in which no one tracked a 12-year-old Waterbury boy after his father and stepmother pulled from school 20 years ago and, according to police, neglected him as a captive in their home.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said case exposed shortcomings in the Waterbury schools and Department of Children and Families, not with the state’s permissive laws covering home schooling.
House Bill 7009 was amended in the House to include provisions of at least seven other bills that had been favorably reported out of the Education Committee. It marked the second time in as many years the committee wrapped much of its work into a single amended bill negotiated with the Republican minority.
The technique provides a surer path to passage as the General Assembly begins its three-week push its constitutional adjournment deadline of midnight June 4.

The bill avoids addressing whether Connecticut’s school racial imbalance law should be revised and instead delays implementation, as the General Assembly did in a similar omnibus bill last year and has periodically ordered since the law’s adoption in 1969.
The law was intended to address segregation in public schools by requiring school systems to report racial demographics of each school to the state Board of Education and note when a school’s number of minority students is substantially more or less than the system-wide average.
One weakness of the law is that it measures imbalances within school systems, ignoring segregation on a regional basis. Leeper said one consequence is that school systems can be pressured to redistrict schools that are integrated but not precisely balanced.
Fairfield, Greenwich, Groton, Hamden and West Hartford have faced imbalances, she said.
“This law has resulted in the breaking up of our most integrated schools, which I don’t think was the intent of the law, and has caused those five communities over many years a lot of challenges in trying how to best address that,” Leeper said.
Last year, the legislature delayed any push by the state to address imbalances by one year to July 1, 2025. The bill passed Tuesday extends the deadline until 2029.
The measure also delayed another deadline: the age at which children must begin kindergarten. Beginning in 2027, children must begin kindergarten if they are 5 by September.
The bill also directs the Department of Education to establish criteria by which local schools may affix a “Connecticut State Seal of Civics Education and Engagement” on a diploma awarded to students with “a high level of proficiency in civics education.”
It also sets standards for school crisis drills and directs local systems to adopt policies intended to break students of their reliance on smart phones and other digital devices.
Whether those devices will be banned is left to local school systems.

Several employees who were laid off decried what they called a ""disrespectful"" and ""humiliating"" process. The mayor said it was the most difficult week of her tenure.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Burlington layoffs generate backlash as mayor presents balanced budget to City Council.","Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak gives an update on the city’s health and safety issues during a press conference in Burlington on Thursday, Feb. 13. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerJoanne Putzier, an employee with the Burlington Parks, Recreation & Waterfront Department, was months away from a planned retirement to cap her 43-year career with the city.But Thursday, she and 17 other city employees were laid off, part of a cost-saving measure by the city to close an $8 million gap in next year’s budget.The affected employees were offered 60 days’ pay and health insurance through the end of July, city officials said. But Putzier and others attending Monday night’s City Council meeting decried the process as “degrading.”“After 43 years, on Thursday, I was met with, ‘Hand in your stuff, you’re done,'” she said.Melissa Cate, a fellow parks employee with more than 30 years of service who was also laid off, said at Monday’s council meeting that the process felt “disrespectful, insulting and humiliating for those of us who have so loyally served this city and who love our jobs.”Progressive Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, one year into her three-year term, has been tasked with managing a painful financial situation. This budget season marks the second straight year the first-term mayor is responding to a multimillion-dollar budget gap.The city last year closed a $14.2 million budget gap in part by increasing existing taxes and fees and using nearly $4 million in one-time funds. That was not an option this year.“I do say this with great honesty and humility that this has been the hardest week of being the mayor of the city of Burlington,” Mulvaney-Stanak told city councilors Monday night. “A lot of things have kind of come to the head about how our structural budget challenges, as a city, for many years now, have led us to this point of making very difficult decisions.”During a Monday morning press conference, Mulvaney-Stanak said the city had added nearly 100 positions to the general fund over a 10-year period, including 37 positions created with one-time funding sources through federal or state grants or pandemic relief funding.The city’s financial situation required officials to reduce programs, services and staffing, she said. Continuing to rely on municipal property tax rate increases to fund these would be unsustainable.“It is not good for taxpayers, it is not good for the employees holding that position, and it overpromises what we’re able to afford as a city,” Mulvaney-Stanak said at Monday morning’s press conference.The mayor’s budget proposal, presented to the City Council on Monday night, would close next fiscal year’s $8 million gap in part through job cuts, department mergers and other cost-saving measures, without significantly raising taxes, officials said.Of the 25 positions eliminated, seven were currently vacant. There were 12 American Federation of State, County and Municipal union positions and 13 non-union positions eliminated in total.The city’s parks department was the most impacted, with eight employees and two division directors laid off.“Our recreation division was decimated,” Cate, the now-former division director of recreational facilities for the parks department, said at the meeting.The city cut positions in several other departments, such as the Community & Economic Development Office and in the Business & Workforce Development department. Five vacant, non-officer positions, as well as the public information officer position, were cut from the Burlington Police Department.The city is slashing spending by merging the Community & Economic Development Office and Business & Workforce Development. On Monday morning, the mayor said one department head position had been eliminated as part of that merger, but she did not disclose which department head.Kara Alnasrawi, the Business & Workforce Development director, was present at the Monday morning press conference, while Brian Pine, the CEDO director, was absent.

Burlington cuts 25 full-time positions as city faces a difficult financial future 

by Corey McDonald 
May 9, 2025, 12:04 pmMay 9, 2025, 3:44 pm 



RightsizingAltogether, the jobs, mergers and other cuts amounted to $3.9 million in savings, officials said. Absent the cuts, a property owner of a $500,000 home would have paid $325 more per year in property taxes.Instead, the $108.3 million budget comes with “modest” tax increases for the city’s public safety, parks and highway taxes, according to Katherine Schad, the city’s chief administrative officer. As a result, the same owner of a $500,000 property would pay $35 more in municipal property tax per year.City property taxes increased by 6% in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, and by 11% last year — translating to a $190, $220 and $401 increase on a hypothetical $500,000 home.“We’ve worked hard to try and stabilize that, understanding that affordability is critical to the residents of Burlington,” Schad said.The city did make some investments in next year’s budget. A new “senior advisor” position was created to “help the city create an innovative strategy around housing production of all types.”Funding for 10 more police officers was included, as well as an investment into the Howard Center’s Street Outreach Team.But Mulvaney-Stanak’s budget proposal was not without criticism. Some, including Ward 7 City Councilor Evan Litwin, questioned whether the city was cutting enough.“As difficult as it is to say, we need to actually work harder to reduce this budget, and I’m not sure we are necessarily rightsizing the government at this moment,” Litwin said.Litwin, along with Council President Ben Traverse and Councilor Mark Barlow, expressed their disappointment in the timeliness of the proposal, saying councilors had been left in the dark.“I find it frustrating these decisions were made before the City Council has reviewed and given any feedback,” Barlow said. “It’s hard for the City Council to be a good partner in this work if information is not made available as it’s ready, and if we are not asked for our input before decisions are made.”The city will be on a tight timeline to sift through the budget proposal. The mayor will have until June 15 to present a final budget, and the council will have to pass a budget before the fiscal year begins in July.Other councilors questioned how the mayor and her staff gave notice to the 18 affected employees. Ward 6 City Councilor Becca Brown McKnight said she was taken aback by comments made by the former parks department employees.“To hear them talk about what they went through, it felt like I was listening to somebody who worked at Walmart or something, where people are not valued and where 40-year employees are walked out the door,” McKnight said. “That is just straight up not right. That was really troubling, and it brings up a lot of questions.”Mulvaney-Stanak defended the process by noting it was uncharted territory for the city. Thursday marked the first time in recent memory that the city was forced to conduct mass layoffs.The city, she said, had little policy guidance to navigate a formal reduction-in-force process, making it “extremely difficult to have to navigate this very stressful, impactful moment in the city’s history without a roadmap about how to do this as an organization.”Colby Delaire, president of the local American Federation of State, County and Municipal union, said at the meeting he was appreciative that the mayor and her staff limited the number of job cuts being proposed.Still, he said, “even one cut is too many for us.”“Really, the only thing for us is looking for some sort of commitment that in the future we will not do this again,” he said. “We need to be adamant that we do not do this again.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Burlington layoffs generate backlash as mayor presents balanced budget to City Council.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/health-safety-presser-1-20250213-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-13 17:07:47.297892
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-13 20:55:34+00:00,CT Mirror,CT Senate takes up legislation to expand oversight of municipal summer camps,Jessika Harkay,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/13/ct-municipal-summer-camp-bill/,"The omnibus bill, which in part requires state regulation of municipal summer camps, follows a child sexual assault case at a CT summer camp.","The Connecticut Senate took up S.B. 6 Tuesday, an omnibus bill that lays out extra support and protections for children across the state. Lawmakers expected the bill to pass, after debate stretched late into the afternoon. 
The legislation proposes new regulations for annual reporting on disconnected youth and encourages early childhood education programs to use federal programs to provide more nutritious food to children. But proponents specifically highlighted the bill’s provisions intended to increase oversight of Connecticut town-run summer camps as its most important component.
“Today is about making our children safer,” Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said at a news conference Tuesday morning. “We do live in one of the safest states in the country, but there’s always more that we can do, and when we see problems, we work to fix those problems.”
Currently, Connecticut law allows municipal camps for children to operate with no state regulation or oversight, in contrast to programs run by private companies and nonprofits, which must be licensed by the state. Municipal programs instead fall under the umbrella of local governments, which set their own standards — like whether counselors receive background checks or whether water quality is tested.
“The fact that [the Office of Early Childhood] oversees child care and camps and yet does not oversee municipal camps is a very big hole,” said Committee on Children’s Co-chair Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton.
Senate Bill 6 would subject municipal camps to more state oversight and require them to be licensed by the Office of Early Childhood.
The proposal comes in the wake of a sex assault case in Bethany where a longtime counselor in the summer camps and after-school programs, who was also a substitute teacher in Bethany, was charged with two counts of first-degree sexual assault, four counts of illegal sexual contact, five counts of fourth-degree sexual assault and one count of risk of injury to a minor.
Despite an allegation of sexual assault in December 2022, Anthony Mastrangelo remained on staff within the Bethany Parks and Recreational Department for several months.
“We cannot let something like this ever happen again,” Amy Lestinsky, a mother of one of the young girls who was sexually assaulted, said at Tuesday’s press conference. 
“If our towns’ Parks and Recs program had been licensed, and proper rules and guidelines had been in place and were followed, it is likely he would have been immediately removed, been removed from the program and his removal would have alerted me of a problem,” Lestinsky said. “I would have put an end to him babysitting my daughter and she would have been spared.”
Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Bethany, added that the small town of around 5,500 people was “unfortunately a victim.”
“What we are attempting to do here is basically bring them to parity, just like we do for our nonprofits and our private camps, to make sure that our children are supported and make sure we have proper oversight,” Cabrera said.
The bill has met with opposition from Republican lawmakers who say the proposed legislation would not have prevented what happened in Bethany.
“[Mastrangelo] was a substitute teacher that had a background check [through the school system],” Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, said Tuesday at a news conference held by Republican leaders. “You can’t legislate somebody who’s going to act in that way.”
Senate Republicans also raised concerns at their news conference and on the Senate floor Tuesday that the legislation would “cripple” municipal summer camps across the state. Republican leaders said towns and cities would have to cover additional costs to implement the legislation, which could mean local towns spending thousands of dollars for things like upgrading bathroom facilities to meet existing licensure standards and paying for background checks.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said the new rules would make programs less accessible to low-income families.
“[Democrats] are using it as an excuse to get more control,” Harding said. “Don’t put more regulations on municipal camps and take away that opportunity for countless kids across that state that attend these camps that do a great job. They’re safe, they’re well-run and they provide a great opportunity for students.”
The legislation would also cost at least $1.8 million in the upcoming fiscal year for the Office of Early Childhood to create a licensure department, according to an analysis by the state’s Office of Fiscal Analysis.
Somers and Harding were joined at the GOP news conference Tuesday afternoon by Valerie Stolfi Collins, the executive director of the Connecticut Recreation and Parks Association, and Mark Simmons, who serves as the Parks and Recreation and Youth Services Bureau in Preston, who also opposed the bill.
“Senate Bill 6 has site requirements, as well as facility requirements and restrictions on age for hiring staff. These requirements do not make it possible for us to operate our camps, and will simply force us to consolidate or close our camps,” Simmons said Tuesday. “We should be pointing our efforts toward making camps and childcare more accessible, and these stipulations and the requirements are simply counteractive to that.”
Republicans proposed several amendments on the floor Tuesday, seeking to eliminate the licensure requirements, provide state funding to municipalities to cover costs and other changes.
Maher urged lawmakers to vote against the amendments early Tuesday afternoon. While many camps claim the licensing requirements are onerous and could force them to close, Maher said, “The truth is that many, many municipal camps are already doing what is required in terms of licensing, because they want to provide good quality camps with oversight.”
She said that the pushback comes from concerns about cost increases, but she believes those worries are overblown. “If there is an increase, it would be a slight increase in cost.”

In addition to requests for double-digit premium increases, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont is also cutting back on coverage of popular weight-loss drugs on some plans. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Health insurers ask to increase health plan premiums, amid rising health care costs.","Don George, president and CEO of BlueCross BlueShield Vermont, on May 31, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerTwo Vermont health insurance companies are seeking higher premiums for plans bought on the state marketplace in 2026, requests that come amid rapidly rising health care costs statewide.Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont is seeking to raise the cost of its premiums by an average of 23.3% for individual plans and 13.7% for small group plans on the state health insurance exchange next year. MVP, the other insurer that sells on the exchange, is seeking average increases of 6.2% for individual plans and 7.5% for small group plans. Individual plans cover single Vermonters or families, while small group plans are bought by employers with 100 or fewer people. Each spring, health insurers ask the Green Mountain Care Board, a state health care regulator, to approve changes to the cost of plans bought on the Vermont insurance marketplace, Vermont Health Connect. In recent years, costs for those plans have skyrocketed due to rising costs for health care and pharmaceuticals. Blue Cross Blue Shield’s prices have grown particularly quickly, as the Vermont insurer faces an unprecedented financial crisis. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, Blue Cross has seen its cash reserves drained as members seek more care for more complex health conditions. A significant chunk of the proposed 2026 hikes — about 7 percentage points of the increases for both types of plans, according to the insurer — will go into the bank to shore up those reserves. That’s one major reason for the difference between the price hikes at Blue Cross and MVP. Another reason, according to Sara Teachout, a spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, is that the insurer’s pool of customers is less healthy than MVP’s, because many customers who need more care gravitate toward its plans.“I think that there is a perception that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont and the Blue system has very comprehensive health care coverage,” she said.  “I think it’s true — but I think it also is a perception.”Jordan Estey, a spokesperson for MVP, said in an email that she could not comment on the filings from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont.“At MVP, our rate request is grounded in a thorough financial evaluation of the Vermont market through systematic and standard actuarial practices,” Estey said. “Our request reflects the rising cost of care, escalating pharmaceutical expenses, and increased utilization of health care services.”Currently, Blue Cross Blue Shield insures about 24,000 Vermonters on individual plans and 15,000 on small group plans. MVP insures about 12,000 people on individual plans and 18,000 people on small group plans. READ MORE
In an effort to reduce costs, Blue Cross Blue Shield is also cutting back on coverage of popular weight-loss drugs known as GLP-1s, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, said Teachout, the Blue Cross spokesperson. The insurer will no longer cover the drugs for the purpose of weight loss for people on small group or individual plans. The pharmaceuticals will still be covered for diabetes.Teachout said without that change, the requested premium hikes would be even higher — an increase of 1.3 percentage points for individual plans and 2.3 percentage points for small group plans. “Blue Cross VT made these changes after careful consideration of the GLP-1 weight loss drug’s efficacy, adherence, access, and cost,” Teachout wrote in an email. It wasn’t clear whether MVP is changing its coverage of the drugs. Estey, the MVP spokesperson, wrote in an email that the insurer “continuously reviews its coverage policies and pharmaceutical benefits, including GLP-1s, to ensure they meet customer needs and align with best practices.”One key factor complicating the picture is uncertainty surrounding federal subsidies that help people pay for health insurance. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the federal government expanded eligibility for tax credits to help people afford insurance premiums. Those expanded tax credits are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. But if Congress takes action to extend them as they currently exist, Vermont’s health insurers are projecting significantly lower premium increases: a 15.61% increase for Blue Cross Blue Shield’s individual plans and, for MVP, a decrease of 0.48% for individual plans. That’s because the expiring credits are likely to drive people to drop their insurance, or purchase lower-cost plans with less generous benefits, according to Teachout. But what, if any, action the federal government may take remains up in the air. Mike Fisher, Vermont’s chief health care advocate, said health insurance is already unaffordable for many Vermonters, even before next year’s rate hikes. Large increases — and the potential for decreased federal help — “will be incredibly difficult, or devastating, for many Vermonters and Vermont small businesses,” Fisher said.“We need to find ways to spend less on our health care here in Vermont,” he said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Health insurers ask to increase health plan premiums, amid rising health care costs.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bernie-health-costs-7-20240531-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-13 17:07:47.297892

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Florida House and Senate have made no progress toward a budget deal during the past three weeks, House Speaker Daniel Perez acknowledged Tuesday, saying budget negotiations have to “start all over again.”
The House voted Tuesday to further extend the already-extended session, from June 6 to June 30. Although, since the Senate did not meet, the House-desired extension is not solid. 
Perez, during a half-hour floor session Tuesday, emphasized the contrast between the House and Senate and governor’s office in budget negotiations. 
“The governor isn’t willing to have a conversation, period, period,” Perez said. “There’s no difference between him and any seventh grader in Miami Dade County right now who tweets.”
Perez said he hasn’t spoken to Gov. Ron DeSantis in “quite some time.”
Budget, tax deal off the table

The two chambers said on May 2 that they had agreed to a budget framework, which included a cut to sales taxes. That framework was no more after DeSantis said last week a sales tax cut would be “dead on arrival” and Albritton issued a memo to senators soliciting advice to develop a new tax package. 
“I have very strong feelings about the Senate president’s actions,” Perez told his chamber. “As presiding officers, as elected officials, our word is our bond. Breaking our word, breaking a deal, is breaking faith, not only with one another, but also with our institutions. However, I will not allow these actions to deter us from fulfilling our constitutional obligations.”
Dropping the agreement was a surprise to Perez. 
“For me, in my community of Miami, and my culture as a Cuban, your word is your bond, and that means everything to us,” Perez told reporters Tuesday. “I’m one of the old-school guys. I can broker a deal off a handshake.”
Perez said he does not think a final budget is any closer than it was three weeks ago and told to members the budget is “truly worth fighting for.”
Budget negotiations, Perez said, are “moving at a snail’s pace,” are “fluid,” and he had nothing “concrete” to share. 
Perez has criticized the governor for releasing videos on social media criticizing the House instead of engaging in direct conversations.
“At some point, adults have to prevail. I am willing to have that conversation in person at any moment. He is not. … Why are you not willing to have a tough conversation? What is it, that, are you scared? Is he scared of having a tough conversation? I have no other conclusion to reach but that,” Perez told reporters. 
Perez criticized DeSantis’ use of the state’s airplane to fly around Florida, especially in the past few weeks, to insult the House. DeSantis spent Tuesday at the Ohio Capitol advocating for congressional term limits. 
“I know today he took his private plane out to Ohio,” Perez said. “If he would spend more time here in this Capitol having conversations with myself and other members of the House, he would understand our position, why we’re in that position,”
Priorities
The House resolution to extend until June 30 includes the same list of bills in the original extension that may be taken up. Among them are budget-related bills, including SB 110, the $200 million Rural Renaissance, a priority for Albritton. All other bills died May 2. 
Throughout the session, House committees questioned “the numerous failures of our state agencies,” as Perez put it, reiterating that the state has a “spending problem.”
Perez said, “Cutting recurring spending is the number one goal of the House. The House is not moving.”
DeSantis wants to eliminate property taxes, and leaders of each chambers have shown interest in that idea. Voters would have to decide to do that in 2026 at the earliest. In the meantime, DeSantis has proposed a $1,000 property tax rebate for Florida homeowners. 
The only option Perez has ruled out, he said, “is simply mailing $1,000 checks from the state treasury,” saying that would not solve the property tax problem. 
“They are just state taxpayers apologizing for local government spending, which is the kind of irresponsible idea I associate with California policy makers,” Perez said. 
Albritton has said senators have told him a 0.25% sales tax reduction is not “meaningful” and that a $2.5 billion recurring tax cut could constrain options for “major property tax reform.”
A Senate spokesperson told the Phoenix that Albritton remains “hopeful” that the budget can be completed by June 6 and “the president was opposed to the expense of bringing senators up to Tallahassee this week to vote on a procedural motion.”
“We have to remember that this is a part-time Legislature. Most of my members, including myself, have other jobs, like full-time jobs, and we need to be able to have the predictability of a schedule so that we can get back to fulfilling those duties,” Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell told reporters Tuesday. 
Neither Perez nor Driskell was concerned about a shutdown should talks stretch past July 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year. 
“I think it’s likely that nothing could get done,” and “the worst case scenario” is “a skeletal-type budget that funds critical resources and probably nothing else,” Driskell said.

According to the complaints, both Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have threatened to cut off funding to states that refuse to comply with President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda.
While no federal funding is currently being withheld, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said during a press conference on Tuesday that the threat was “imminent.”
“President Donald Trump can’t use these funds as a bargaining chip as his way of ensuring states abide by his preferred policies,” Bonta added.
Email messages seeking comment were sent Tuesday to the departments of Transportation and Homeland Security.
Both lawsuits say that the Trump administration is violating the U.S. Constitution by trying to dictate federal spending when Congress has that power — not the executive branch.
On April 24, states received letters from the Department of Transportation stating that they must cooperate on immigration efforts and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs or risk losing funds.
New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin criticized the timing of Duffy’s letter when Newark’s airport struggles with radar outages and other issues.
“I wish the administration would stop playing politics with people’s lives,” Platkin said. “I wish Secretary Duffy would do his damn job, which is to make sure planes land on time, not to direct immigration enforcement.”
Meanwhile, on Feb. 24, states received letters from the Department of Homeland Security declaring that states that “refuse to cooperate with, refuse to share information with, or even actively obstruct federal immigration enforcement reject these ideals and the history we share in common as Americans.”
“If any government entity chooses to thumb its nose at the Department of Homeland Security’s national security and public safety mission, it should not receive a single dollar of the Department’s money unless Congress has specifically required it,” Noem wrote in her letter.
Attorneys general behind the lawsuits include the following states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai’i, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont.
The cases are being spearheaded by California but were filed in federal court in Rhode Island, a detail that the attorneys general defended by saying they filed an “any court that is going to be fair and objective and consider our factual presentation and legal analysis.”
The lawsuits are the latest legal actions that Democratic-led states have taken against Trump since he took office earlier this year. Bonta noted that California has filed more than 20 lawsuits against the administration, while Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said his state has launched more than a dozen.
While the lawsuits have challenged policies on tariffs, federal employee firings to health care research, Trump’s focus on immigration enforcement and the mass deportation of immigrants in the United States illegally have received the most attention.
This has included the promise to mass-deport people to the start of a registry required for all those who are in the country illegally.

There’s no reason why money for road repairs and flood protections should hinge upon states’ cooperation with federal immigration policies, contend 20 Democratic states attorneys general.
That’s why the AGs are asking a federal judge to stop federal agencies from a “grant funding hostage scheme” that requires detaining undocumented immigrants who don’t commit crimes in order to receive key federal grants and aid.
Two new federal lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) aim to protect and preserve billions of federal dollars already awarded to states for emergency preparedness, disaster relief and infrastructure projects.
Directives issued in April by DHS and DOT secretaries informed states that their federal funding required compliance with federal immigration policies. The AGs — representing Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont — allege this violated constitutional protections for separation of powers.
“By hanging a halt in this critical funding over States like a sword of Damocles, Defendants impose immense harm on States, forcing them to choose between readiness for disasters and emergencies, on the one hand, and their judgment about how best to investigate and prosecute crimes, on the other,” the lawsuit against DHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Coast Guard, and their leaders, states.
“Defendants’ grant funding hostage scheme violates two key principles that underlie the American system of checks and balances: agencies in the Executive Branch cannot act contrary to the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government cannot use the spending power to coerce States into adopting its preferred policies. Defendants have ignored both principles, claiming undelegated power to place their own conditions on dozens of grant programs that Congress created and bulldozing through the Constitution’s boundary between state and federal authority.”
The AGs say state and local public safety officials have more important work to do than cater to the whims of a new administration, which stand in contradiction to state-level directives like, for example, authorizing licenses for undocumented immigrants. Rhode Island lawmakers granted driving privileges for undocumented residents in 2022, with a July, 1 2023 effective date, joining 19 other states and D.C.
States are telling sheriffs whether they can — or can’t — work with ICE

Federal protocols followed by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies could force state and local police to use state license laws as a way to find and detain undocumented immigrants.
“As a former U.S. Attorney and former federal prosecutor, I know how many ICE agents are in Rhode Island and it’s under 10,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, said during a virtual news conference Tuesday. “What they need in order to carry out their agenda is for us to do the work for them, pulling us away from important law enforcement work in Rhode Island.”
No state has seen federal funding cut off since directives were issued by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Not yet.
States’ abilities to respond to natural disasters and security threats, and complete key infrastructure projects, including the much-anticipated rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge in Rhode Island, hinge upon a continued flow of congressionally authorized federal grants and aid.
The $221 million Biden-era infrastructure grant awarded to Rhode Island for the Washington Bridge project only became accessible in late March, after weeks of uncertainty in the wake of the administration change. Gov. Dan McKee’s office and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday regarding continued access to the funds in the wake of Duffy’s April 24 directive tying federal infrastructure grants to compliance with federal diversity and immigration policies.
The Duffy directive fails to provide any statutory or legal explanation for why transportation funding relates to immigration enforcement. The new requirements  jeopardize more than $628 million in federal funding in Rhode Island, and billions of dollars more across the country, the AGs argue in their lawsuit against Duffy and DOT.
“If Plaintiff States reject Defendants’ unlawful Immigration Enforcement Condition, they will collectively lose billions in federal funding that is essential to sustain critical public safety and transportation programs, including highway development, airport safety projects, protections against train collisions, and programs to prevent injuries and deaths from traffic accidents. The loss of this funding will cause state and local providers to scale back or even terminate many of these programs and projects,” the complaint states. “More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States.”
Deep cuts to bus and rail services loom across big cities, small towns



Similarly dire predictions accompany the loss of security and disaster funds, which includes $3 billion in FEMA money to states each year, according to the lawsuit against DHS. Rhode Island received more than $45 million in FEMA grants in 2024 alone, according to the lawsuit.


The new complaints reprise language of the 20 state AG lawsuits against the Trump administration that preceded them, calling the executive agencies’ actions “arbitrary and capricious” and in clear violation of constitutional separation of powers and spending clauses.
Neronha during the press conference pointed to the success that AGs have had in other lawsuits, temporarily preserving funding and policy protections for education, immigration, research funding, public health, and grants and aid to state governments, among others.
Not that he expects the frenzy of legal activity will abate anytime soon.
“As we stack wins against the Trump administration for violation of the Constitution and other federal laws, what we are seeing is a creeping authoritarianism in this country,” Neronha said. “The president is trying to take power for himself. He’s trying to sideline Congress, and now, he’s attempting to undermine the judiciary.”
Neronha likened the latest federal directives attempting to force states to redirect their own law enforcement to serve federal civil immigration policies to “holding a gun to states’ heads.”
Rhode Island, home to four of the 20 federal lawsuits against the Trump administration already, was again picked as the setting for the latest complaints due to the “strong team” within Neronha’s office, he said.
Neronha and other AGs bringing the two cases against the administration also stressed the sum of their collaborative parts.
“We’ve built the best and biggest law firm in the country, and we’re fighting for all Americans,” Neronha said.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
The lawsuit against DOT was assigned to U.S. District Chief Judge John Jr. McConnell Jr., while the case against DHS was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith, according to the public court docket.

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the NMexus Center, a global business accelerator, will assist companies with the costs of relocating to the U.S., including job training, human resources and legal issues.
“Don’t think of it as a soft landing; think of it as more of a launch pad for investing and expanding businesses,” Lujan Grisham said during a news conference at the SelectUSA Investment Summit in National Harbor, Maryland, organized by the International Trade Administration, a government agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce.
NMexus Center Executive Director Amar Vakil said at the news conference the accelerator will help businesses obtain work visas, identify customers and market their products.
Seven companies have agreed to initially relocate to the accelerator, starting with a total of about 40 jobs in Albuquerque, Lujan Grisham said. The companies are from India and Oman and include Zonap Engineering India; Alligator Automations; DCirrus, Inc.; Supreme Technology; American Grain Corporation; Oliver Merino LLC; and Ardic, according to a news release published by the governor’s office.
Lujan Grisham said the goal is to create approximately 1,500 new jobs related to water, cybersecurity, energy and agriculture. In the news release, her office estimated the accelerator will have a total economic impact of $400 million. There will be a ribbon cutting ceremony in June, she said.
NMexus will be located in Albuquerque’s Mesa del Sol area, within the U.S. House of Representatives district represented by Democrat Rep. Melanie Stansbury, who said it will bring jobs back to the state.
“New Mexicans are strong, resilient, determined, creative and we are ready to bring international partners to employ our people and bring good-paying jobs back to the United States and back to my home state that I grew up and was born and raised in, and to my district,” Stansbury said at the news conference.
The governor also announced partnerships with other foreign companies that are considered NMexus “strategic partners”: IIT Kanpur, the Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Oman Business Network and the Traders Advocacy Group of Ghana.
City of Albuquerque Economic Development Director Max Gruner said at the news conference NMexus will act as an “infrastructure of welcome” for foreign companies to come to and stay in New Mexico.
“In New Mexico, in Albuquerque, we are writing the economy of the possible,” Gruner said. “We are not guided by a nostalgia of a golden age long ago, we are navigating by a horizon of possibility, by a vision of a future where opportunity is abundant and resilient.”
Center Executive Director Vakil said companies’ path to the American success story “runs through New Mexico.”
“New Mexico believes in taking risks, investing in partnerships and investing in global ambition,” Vakil said. “These ambitions can be fast-tracked into a success story in the state of New Mexico.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-13 20:32:37+00:00,CT Mirror,Jahana Hayes proposes bill to expand food program for youths,James Watson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/13/jahana-hayes-summer-ebt-bill/,The expansion of the 'Stop Child Hunger Summer Act' would come amid concerns about federal funding for food-assistance programs.,"U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-Conn., is sponsoring a bill to extend food benefits for low income children amid federal funding concerns for state-run food assistance programs.
The “Stop Child Hunger Act” is an expansion of the existing “Stop Child Hunger Summer Act,” passed in December 2022, that enabled summer Electronic Bank Transfers (EBTs) to families of kids from low-income households who were unable to access free school meals during the summer.
The bill would expand the program to winter and spring breaks and include school closures and periods of operating remotely. 
After running for the first time in 2024, funding for the summer EBT program was delayed this year after restructuring within the federal government’s Food and Nutrition Service program, which distributes funding for summer EBT to the states.
“This brought in $37.6 million in federal funds to the state economy,” said Christine Stuart, spokesperson for the Department of Social Services, which oversees the program in Connecticut. She added that they “heard from a number of families who were grateful for the additional assistance at a time of increased food insecurity.”
Known as SUN Bucks, the program provides families that are eligible with a $120 transfer per child. These funds are loaded on a card that is valid for 122 days. More than 313,000 children benefitted from the program last year in Connecticut.
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said the issue should be addressed at the federal level. 
“Families in Connecticut rely on free or reduced lunch during the school year, and that doesn’t go away just because school’s out of session,” he said.
“Trump and Republicans want to cut SNAP so they can give tax cuts to their billionaire friends,” he added.
Last year was the first time in 50 years that Congress had expanded plans for child hunger prevention. It had, in Hayes’ view, been successful.
Families whose children are already on reduced price free school meals, HUSKY A (the state’s Medicaid program) or the state Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) automatically qualify for this benefit. About 97% of the families that received benefits already qualify under one of the programs. The rest enroll in the program through the summer EBT Portal.
The groups that help ensure families are enrolled in free school meals or the SNAP program, including Connecticut Foodshare, a statewide food bank, are also experiencing federal funding cuts. Connecticut Foodshare lost $2.7 million in federal funding in March of this year, as a result of the change in emphasis from the USDA.
“SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger,” said Jason Jakubowski, president of Connecticut Foodshare. “If the U.S. Congress decides to make major cuts, it means we are going to see more people in our lines at a time in which we have even less food to give them.”
The bill asks federal government to cover costs for the first 5 years, with a provision to instruct the USDA Secretary to provide $50 million for state grants to facilitate the program’s operation, at a time when the federal government is looking to cut down on spending for food assistance.
Hayes is sponsoring the bill alongside Congressman Mike Levin, D-Calif., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
“We need do everything we can to fight child hunger. I look forward to pushing it forward through the legislative process,” said Levin.
“I’ve been fighting for more than a decade to ensure that kids who rely on free and reduced-price meals during the school year don’t lose access to nutritious meals when school is out,” said Murray. She added that the Summer EBT program “helped feed nearly 600,000 kids in Washington state.”
The bill will now enter the committee referral stage to be considered before moving forward for debate in both houses of congress.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_3773-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-13 17:07:47.297892

That’s why the AGs are asking a federal judge to stop federal agencies from a “grant funding hostage scheme” that requires detaining undocumented immigrants who don’t commit crimes in order to receive key federal grants and aid.
Two new federal lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) aim to protect and preserve billions of federal dollars already awarded to states for emergency preparedness, disaster relief and infrastructure projects.
Directives issued in April by DHS and DOT secretaries informed states that their federal funding required compliance with federal immigration policies. The AGs — representing Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Vermont — allege this violated constitutional protections for separation of powers.
“By hanging a halt in this critical funding over States like a sword of Damocles, Defendants impose immense harm on States, forcing them to choose between readiness for disasters and emergencies, on the one hand, and their judgment about how best to investigate and prosecute crimes, on the other,” the lawsuit against DHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Coast Guard, and their leaders, states.
“Defendants’ grant funding hostage scheme violates two key principles that underlie the American system of checks and balances: agencies in the Executive Branch cannot act contrary to the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government cannot use the spending power to coerce States into adopting its preferred policies. Defendants have ignored both principles, claiming undelegated power to place their own conditions on dozens of grant programs that Congress created and bulldozing through the Constitution’s boundary between state and federal authority.”
The AGs say state and local public safety officials have more important work to do than cater to the whims of a new administration, which stand in contradiction to state-level directives like, for example, authorizing licenses for undocumented immigrants. Rhode Island lawmakers granted driving privileges for undocumented residents in 2022, with a July, 1 2023 effective date, joining 19 other states and D.C.
Federal protocols followed by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies could force state and local police to use state license laws as a way to find and detain undocumented immigrants.
“As a former U.S. Attorney and former federal prosecutor, I know how many ICE agents are in Rhode Island and it’s under 10,” Neronha said during a virtual press conference Tuesday. “What they need in order to carry out their agenda is for us to do the work for them, pulling us away from important law enforcement work in Rhode Island.”

More uncertainty for Washington Bridge
No state has seen federal funding cut off since directives were issued by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Not yet.
States’ abilities to respond to natural disasters and security threats, and complete key infrastructure projects, including the much-anticipated rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge in Rhode Island, hinge upon a continued flow of congressionally authorized federal grants and aid.
The $221 million Biden-era infrastructure grant awarded to Rhode Island for the Washington Bridge project only became accessible in late March, after weeks of uncertainty in the wake of the administration change. Gov. Dan McKee’s office and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday regarding continued access to the funds in the wake of Duffy’s April 24 directive tying federal infrastructure grants to compliance with federal diversity and immigration policies.
The Duffy directive fails to provide any statutory or legal explanation for why transportation funding relates to immigration enforcement. The new requirements  jeopardize more than $628 million in federal funding in Rhode Island, and billions of dollars more across the country, the AGs argue in their lawsuit against Duffy and DOT.
“If Plaintiff States reject Defendants’ unlawful Immigration Enforcement Condition, they will collectively lose billions in federal funding that is essential to sustain critical public safety and transportation programs, including highway development, airport safety projects, protections against train collisions, and programs to prevent injuries and deaths from traffic accidents. The loss of this funding will cause state and local providers to scale back or even terminate many of these programs and projects,” the complaint states. “More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States.”

– Twenty state Democratic AGs in lawsuit against U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy 


Similarly dire predictions accompany the loss of security and disaster funds, which includes $3 billion in FEMA money to states each year, according to the lawsuit against DHS. Rhode Island received more than $45 million in FEMA grants in 2024 alone, according to the lawsuit.
The new complaints reprise language of the 20 state AG lawsuits against the Trump administration that preceded them, calling the executive agencies’ actions “arbitrary and capricious” and in clear violation of constitutional separation of powers and spending clauses.
Neronha during the press conference pointed to the success that AGs have had in other lawsuits, temporarily preserving funding and policy protections for education, immigration, research funding, public health, and grants and aid to state governments, among others.
Not that he expects the frenzy of legal activity will abate anytime soon.
“As we stack wins against the Trump administration for violation of the Constitution and other federal laws, what we are seeing is a creeping authoritarianism in this country,” Neronha said. “The president is trying to take power for himself. He’s trying to sideline Congress, and now, he’s attempting to undermine the judiciary.”
Neronha likened the latest federal directives attempting to force states to redirect their own law enforcement to serve federal civil immigration policies to “holding a gun to states’ heads.”
Rhode Island, home to four of the 20 federal lawsuits against the Trump administration already, was again picked as the setting for the latest complaints due to the “strong team” within Neronha’s office, he said.
Neronha and other AGs bringing the two cases against the administration also stressed the sum of their collaborative parts.
“We’ve built the best and biggest law firm in the country, and we’re fighting for all Americans,” Neronha said.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
The lawsuit against DOT was assigned to U.S. District Chief Judge John Jr. McConnell Jr., while the case against DHS was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith, according to the public court docket.

The nonprofit Humane World for Animals, formerly known as the Humane Society of the United States, recently published its 2025 installment of its annual Horrible Hundred report cataloging the most egregious regulatory violations as cited by state and federal inspectors of puppy mills.
For the 13th year in a row, Missouri had the highest number of dealers in the report, with 26 different operators listed. Missouri was followed by Ohio, with 16 operators; Iowa, with 12, and New York and Pennsylvania, with 11 each.

More than half of the breeders in this year’s report are USDA licensed, which means they can legally sell large numbers of puppies to pet stores and to online consumers they haven’t met in person. Thirty-eight of the breeders in the report are repeat offenders who have been included in one or more of the 12 most recent reports.
The Iowa breeders and the violations listed in the 2025 report are:

Steve Kruse of Stonehenge Kennel in West Point: In 2024, after two license suspensions and after appearing in seven prior Horrible Hundred reports, this massive kennel was cited for additional violations. Inspectors noted that the inside of four food bowls were smeared with “dried feces or a thick buildup of dark brown organic material.”
Over the years, more than 140 sick or ailing dogs have been found at the kennel. Kruse received a 21-day suspension from the USDA in March 2023, and in 2021 at least 199 dogs were euthanized at the facility.
Brian Lichirie in West Point: Lichirie is licensed to resell dogs bred by himself or by others to pet stores and other outlets. Sales records suggest he is closely linked to Steve Kruse of Stonehenge Kennel and another Iowa breeder, Wuanita Swedlund.  A lawsuit filed by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in 2024 alleges the USDA has allowed dealers such as Kruse to “launder” dogs through other dealers, such as Lichirie.
A USDA inspection report dated May 30, 2024, indicates that the agency performed a special inspection to recheck four dogs at the kennel, although the reasons for that are unknown. A February 2025 USDA inspection indicates Lichirie had more than 300 animals at that time.
Wuanita Swedlund of Farmington: In December 2024, USDA inspectors found a number of concerns at Swedlund’s breeding operation, including a heavily matted dog, several dogs with no water, and an enclosure that was “heavily contaminated with fecal material.”
Swedlund’s business was referenced in the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals’ lawsuit against the USDA after six of Swedlund’s puppies died in the cold and she was neither fined nor penalized. Past violations at Swedlund’s kennel include references to a dog that was able to enter an adjoining enclosure and partially eat a puppy that later had to be euthanized.
Sherry and Steve Akers of Westwind Wheatens in Red Oak: This AKC-inspected breeder failed two consecutive state inspections in 2024. Inspectors reported two limping dogs, and issued violations for 17 heavily matted dogs, a “very strong and nearly overwhelming” odor of animal waste, and unvaccinated animals.
Robin Demmer of Demmer Doodles in Bernard: During a July 2024 inspection, state inspectors cited this business for four violations. Issues included unsanitary conditions and dogs in need of vaccines. The business also appeared to have acquired at least two litters of puppies from Wisconsin with no proof of vaccination.
Julie Krause of The Buttercream Ranch in Algona: In October 2024, inspectors cited this establishment for selling 17 underage puppies and going more than a year with no visit by a veterinarian. Inspectors also reported some dogs had no medical records. Two visits by state inspectors in 2023 were cataloged as “attempted,” indicating no one was present to let inspectors review the business.
Heath ‘Rex’ Meyers of Century Farm Puppies in Grundy Center: Meyers received an official warning from the USDA in March 2025 after incurring a variety of violations in 2023 and 2024. Some of Meyers’ recent USDA violations included a January 2025 violation for rodent feces around dog food.
In 2024, the USDA reported two dogs were in need of veterinary care, including one which had a 5-inch long wound on her side and a 2-inch wound on her neck. The other dog was in such poor dental health that blood was visible in her mouth and she was “reacting painfully,” inspectors said. In addition, some dogs had no water, and inspectors reported unsanitary conditions. Also in 2024, a female bichon was found with two of her toes trapped in the flooring of her kennel. After being freed, the dog was limping.
Beverly and Douglas Prier of Rocky Valley Shelties and Douglas’ Shepherds & Doods in Dyersville: During an inspection in June 2024, state inspectors found multiple violations, including kennel parts that were unsanitary or had sharp areas that could hurt the dogs. Inspectors also reported a lack of records to prove that veterinary care had been provided and that dogs were being adequately tracked when bought and sold.
Terisa Steiber of Rockytopp Kennels in Lansing: USDA inspectors who visited Rockytopp Kennels in August 2024 found five violations. No veterinarian had visited the kennel in roughly 17 months, at least 72 dogs did not have up-to-date examinations, at least 25 dogs were overdue for rabies vaccinations, and conditions were unsanitary, with dirty walls and feeding receptacles. When inspectors tried to visit again in December 2024, they were denied access to the business.
Rhonda Van Der Zwaag of Van Der Zwaag German Shepherds in Hull: In July 2024, Van der Zwaag failed a state inspection due to lack of proof that a veterinarian had visited the facility since September 2022. In 2022, state inspectors found that multiple puppies at this business had died of parvovirus and other causes, highlighting the need for regular veterinary oversight at the property.
Ruthi Wheatley of Wheatley Kennels in Adair: A state inspector who visited Wheatley Kennels in January 2025 noted that “the owner refused inspection [because] non-compliant issues from October 2024 have [not] been fixed,” adding, “I talked with the owner and gave them a two-week plan to move the dogs to a new facility on the property since they are unable to bring the current facility into compliance.”
Despite not being shown around the kennel, the inspector noted that “While parking my car in the drive and going to the residence I observed one dog run approximately 20 feet by 20 feet … that was 90 to 95 percent covered in feces and urine. I told the owner what I saw in the run and she stated that [it] has not been cleaned [due] to the weather and other ongoing projects at the farm. We discussed the lack of ability to bring the facility into compliance and the options for housing areas on the property. The owners have another facility licensed as a commercial kennel on the property they are moving the commercial breeding dogs into and suspending the boarding activity to make room for the breeding animals.”
Terry Yoder of BR’s Dobermans in Riverside: In March 2025, it was reported that 17 dead dogs were found on the property of BR’s Dobermans. Forty-nine dogs were seized, many of them in poor health, after an individual reported acquiring two sickly dogs from the kennel. The kennel had been inspected two months earlier and was deemed then to be in compliance with all regulations.
Between summer 2024 and winter 2025, state inspectors were denied access to BR’s Dobermans on three occasions and were unable to perform any inspections at the site. Earlier in 2024, inspectors reported excessive trash and clutter, mouse feces “present on all surfaces throughout the facility,” enclosures that were “coated in dirt, hair, feces and grime,” bad odors and more.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and 19 other Democratic attorneys general filed a pair of lawsuits Tuesday against Trump administration policies designed to block federal funding to states that don’t carry out U.S. immigration enforcement.

According to the lawsuits, recently enacted policies at the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and Transportation illegally tie grant funding for items such as natural disaster recovery and road construction to whether the state participates in federal immigration enforcement. The attorneys general say the goal of the policies is to illegally force states to carry out federal immigration responsibilities.

“This FEMA and transportation funding has nothing to do with immigration,” Raoul said during a news conference. “However, it has everything to do with the safety of our residents after natural disasters and as they travel our roads, railways and in the sky.”

Under the 2017 TRUST Act signed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, Illinois law enforcement is prohibited from arresting and, in most cases, detaining a person based solely on their immigration status or assisting immigration officials. State law does not protect people in Illinois from deportation, and federal officers can still make arrests and deport people in Illinois.

The federal policy is illegal, according to the attorneys general, because Congress controls spending and executive branch agencies cannot withhold appropriations allocated by Congress. Furthermore, they argue the states cannot be coerced into enforcing federal immigration laws.

President Donald Trump has signed executive orders designed to cut off federal funding to “sanctuary” states like Illinois. The U.S. Department of Justice also sued Illinois in February over the TRUST Act.

“The administration seeks to jeopardize readiness for disasters and safe roads to try to force Illinois law enforcement officers to shift their focus away from addressing serious crime in our communities in order to instead do the federal government’s job of civil immigration enforcement,” Raoul said.

Billions of dollars of federal funding could be at risk for Illinois, Raoul said. This includes $122 million Illinois received last year for disaster recovery, $2 billion for highways, $60 million for counterterrorism, and $24 million to protect nonprofits from attacks by extremists.

“At a time when the disaster relief and transportation needs of this country are significant, we deserve to know our federal agencies are focused on the welfare of all of us,” Raoul said.

The lawsuits come a week after DHS Secretary Kristi Noem visited Illinois to criticize the state’s “sanctuary” policies.

“This governor has bragged about Illinois being a firewall against President Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda, and it is very clear that he is violating the constitution of the United States because it is a federal law that the federal government set and enforce immigration policies,” Noem said.

Raoul also argued the federal government has never before allocated funding based on whether a state agrees with the president’s political agenda.

No states have lost funding so far as a result of these policies, but it’s “imminent,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said. He did not say why the lawsuits were filed in Rhode Island federal court, which is where Democratic attorneys general have filed many other lawsuits against the Trump administration.

Raoul has seen some success in the more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration his office is involved in. A federal judge in New York last week issued a preliminary injunction blocking a U.S. Department of Education effort to cut off some federal funding to states, giving Illinois access to $77 million.

Illinois has also joined other lawsuits to prevent the Department of Education from being dismantled, ensure the state continues to have access to various types of federal funding, and prevent the federal government from limiting birthright citizenship among others.

The cases appear to be straining his offices’ resources, however, as Raoul is asking state lawmakers to increase funding for his office by $15 million this year to hire more attorneys.

Back-to-back hearings explore whether the state or county is responsible for regulating gravel extraction and what, if any, notification neighbors should get.
The post Judge hears pair of Casper gravel mine lawsuits appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—The right of landowners to “use and enjoy” their properties, due process and the government’s role in a long-simmering fight over leasing state lands for gravel mining at the base of Casper Mountain all surfaced Monday during back-to-back court hearings for a pair of separate but related cases.
“The ability to use and enjoy their property includes drinking the water and breathing the air,” attorney Marci Bramlet told District Court Judge Josh Eames.
Bramlet represents the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance, a coalition of neighbors opposed to Prism Logistics’ gravel mining leases on nearby state land. The alliance is a plaintiff along with landowners Carolyn Griffith, Michael Fernald, Todd and Elizabeth Romsa, Walter Merschat, Jamie Bilek and Pat Sullivan.
Attorney Jim Peters for the Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners countered Monday that the neighbors’ concerns about the gravel mining operation’s detrimental impacts to their property interests are only speculative of potential future harms. 
But the plaintiffs also allege that the leases were granted in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the Wyoming Constitution’s Declaration of Rights, which guarantee due process of law, and should be considered void.
In this case, neighbors have said the state gave no notice, which they argue is part of due process. In February 2024, a nearby resident was surprised to see a backhoe digging on a section of state land in the Coates Road area, just west of Casper.
The state board unanimously approved the leases on a consent agenda without discussion, commissioners have admitted in public meetings.
Casper-based Prism Logistics sought eight gravel mine exploration leases for state-owned land in the area in 2023. The state board granted six in June of that year and the remaining two in October.

After learning the state land board had granted the leases on thousands of acres of state “school trust” lands that generate income for public education, many concerned Natrona County residents began packing public meetings to voice their opposition. From February through September of last year, opponents to the proposed gravel mine attended every Natrona County commission meeting and reiterated their opposition at each meeting.
Natrona County residents also raised complaints at the state level, and even gave Gov. Mark Gordon a tour of the area. A plaintiff in the case and founding member of the alliance, Griffith started a petition, which garnered more than 18,000 signatures in roughly seven months.

At the time, residents raised concerns about the impacts a mining operation would have on the area’s water and air quality. Opponents to the gravel mine also spoke to the detrimental impacts it could have on the area’s natural beauty and recreational value.
These concerns have become the basis for the alliance’s contention that leasing the area for gravel mining harms their ability to “use and enjoy” the land and infringes on their protected property rights.
However, despite the adverse effects the neighbors allege that Prism Logistics’ gravel mine could cause, Bramlet clarified that their legal issues do not lie with Prism but with the state land commissioners, Gov. Mark Gordon, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Superintendent Megan Degenfelder, Treasurer Curt Meier and State Auditor Kristi Racines.
“It is the state we allege has wronged the plaintiffs,” she said.
Peters, on behalf of the state land commissioners, argued that the plaintiffs hadn’t shown the law that specifies how much notice must be given.
What’s the state’s role?
At the same time the state finds itself in one legal battle, it is also trying to extricate itself from another legal fight between Prism Logistics and the Natrona County Board of County Commissioners.
Prism contends that the county board overstepped its authority by amending its zoning rules in September 2024.
During a Sept. 17 meeting, county commissioners unanimously voted to amend the county’s zoning regulations to remove the ability to apply for or obtain a conditional-use permit for extractive industries in Mountain Residential-1 zoning districts. The land Prism Logistics had previously leased from the state was all zoned as MR-1.
The company alleges that the action was taken with the specific intent of preventing Prism from mining. By doing this, Prism argues, the county is preventing it from exercising its rights under the state leases. 
Prism Logistics holds that the state, through the Board of Land Commissioners, has exclusive authority over state lands, and county zoning regulations should not override this authority or interfere with the state leases.

However, Natrona County asserts that local zoning and land use regulations do apply in this case.
“The Wyoming Supreme Court has long held, in a variety of contexts, that gravel, sand, rock, and similar materials are not ‘minerals,’ … and has thus determined that County zoning and land use regulations properly extend to the extraction of such resources,” attorney William P. Schwartz, representing the county, wrote in the counterclaim.
“The Wyoming legislature has delegated Natrona County the authority to exercise its police power, including promulgating zoning and land use regulations, on all lands within the unincorporated areas of Natrona County, without excluding state lands from that delegated authority,” the counterclaim goes on to state.
In asserting that the county commission overstepped the state’s authority, Prism listed the Board of Land Commissioners as an involuntary plaintiff — a role the state aims to see dismissed.
Judge Eames heard the second case immediately after the first suit between the citizens’ group and the state. In Monday’s court proceedings, Prism Logistics attorney Amanda Green argued that the state board should have an interest in the outcome of the case, as companies could be dissuaded from seeking leases in the future if they know county governments have the ability to hinder plans. In turn, she continued, this would impact the state board’s mandate to lease school trust properties that generate income for public education.

However, state attorney Kate Gamble contended that while the state has an interest in leasing state lands, it is then up to the lessee to get any further permitting it needs.
At the same time that Prism listed the state board as an involuntary plaintiff, the company also named the board as a defendant in the case. The state is arguing that it should be neither a plaintiff nor a defendant in this case.
According to court documents, Prism argues that the state board should be included as a defendant “[t]o ensure complete relief in this action and to avoid prejudice to the rights of the state of Wyoming.”
However, the state board posits that the complaint against it lacks any specific allegations, and only references the state board’s authority among other allegations made against the county commission.
“This court should dismiss Prism’s claim against the State Board because there is no justiciable controversy between Prism and the State Board,” the state claims in its motion for dismissal.
In both cases, Eames made no ruling, but took the cases under advisement and will issue written rulings at a later date.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa lawmakers are passing budget bills and a few remaining pieces of policy Tuesday as the Legislature aims to end session within the next few days.
The 2025 legislative session was unofficially set to end May 1, the date when legislators stopped receiving most session per-diem payments. Though this deadline is meant to encourage lawmakers to wrap up their work, they typically do not adjourn before approving the budget for the upcoming year. The new fiscal year begins July 1.
Republican majorities in the House and Senate had specific disagreements about budget items that caused a delay in passing spending bills for the upcoming year earlier in May, but reached an agreement May 8. 
Another roadblock appeared in the form of a dispute over carbon sequestration pipelines. A dozen GOP senators said they would not vote in favor of budget bills if chamber leaders did not bring up House File 639, to limit the use of eminent domain in carbon pipeline projects. Following days of delays and a lengthy, contentious debate Monday night, the Iowa Senate finally sent the bill to the governor’s desk.
On Tuesday, both chambers met to pass agreed-upon spending measures, alongside some outstanding policy proposals. Here’s what to know:
 Senators move on appropriations bills

The Senate sent two appropriations bills to the House Tuesday afternoon, approving the legislation along party lines.
Judicial branch: Senate File 648 appropriates $221.83 million in funding for the state’s court system. The bill included a $1.27 million increase for judicial officer salaries, Sen. Julian Garrett, R-Indianola said, representing a 2.5% pay raise. Iowa Supreme Court Chief Justice Susan Christensen had said in her January Condition of the Judiciary address that despite the 5% increase to judicial pay granted in 2024, pay for justices and judges in the state remains behind national averages.
Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, said the 2.5% bump in judicial pay is not enough to turn the tide of the judicial shortages in the state system.
“We are struggling to find judges throughout the state,” Blake said. “… One recent opening for a judge only had two applicants. There’s literally people just raising their hand and saying, ‘I’ll do it,’ with no diversity, because of the problem that we’re having related to funding our judges.”
He also said the measure does not provide needed funding for court reporters, another field suffering a worker shortage in the courts system. While Blake said there were underfunded areas in the budget, he also said having an overall revenue deficit in the state “makes it hard for me to come up here and talk about all the needs (not) being met.”
Garrett said he understands the want to increase judicial pay by a larger rate.
“What I’ll tell you is we did the best we could with what we had,” Garrett said. “We would like to have done a little better. We did give the judges 2.5% increase. We gave a 5% increase last year. So you know, we’re doing what we can with what we had to work with.”
Economic development: The state economic development budget, Senate File 645, provides a decrease of $450,000 in general fund appropriations, but a net increase of $25,000 with money coming from other funds. It includes a $150,000 reduction for the World Food Prize and $150,000 reduction to the state tourism office compared to the current fiscal year, which bill manager Sen. Mark Lofgren, R-Muscatine, said was unfortunate but “we had to do just to balance the budget out.”
The bill extends funding for the continuation of the Housing Renewal Pilot Program for three years, a program providing grants for the acquisition, rehabilitation and redevelopment of buildings, including blighted structures, throughout the state that was set to end this year. 
It also includes $1.25 million for the grocer reinvestment and local food processing fund, contingent on the enactment of the program proposed in House File 1032. The legislation, passed unanimously by the House but not yet taken up by the Senate, would provide allow new or existing grocery stores to apply for funding to expand capacity, upgrade or purchase equipment and cover professional costs.
Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said the stated goals of the bill – to encourage economic growth and development in the state – are not being met by Republicans’ budget proposal. However, he also echoed other Democrats’ comments on appropriations bills this session, saying the funding needed for the state was not attainable because of the budget deficit.
“One of the real issues that I have again about this bill isn’t so much about what it doesn’t do across this state, but really the situation we’re in, to be able to do what we need to do,” Dotzler said. He made an analogy to the budget being like a “boat full of sailors went out on the evening, on a binge, and woke up in the morning with this huge deficit spending tattoo, and they didn’t know how to get rid of it.”
 “We need to work on getting rid of the deficit spending we have,” Dotzler said. “What we’re doing isn’t working for economic developments.”
House sends anti-DEI bill to governor’s desk
The Iowa House passed legislation barring state entities and community colleges from funding diversity, equity and inclusion offices or positions Tuesday, concurring with the Senate to remove private universities from the bill and send it to Gov. Kim Reynolds’s desk.
House File 856 would prohibit state agencies, authorities, cities, counties and community colleges from spending public or private dollars on opening or maintaining DEI offices, or on hiring or keeping DEI officers, with exceptions. The legislation originally passed out of the House in March, but it bounced back to the chamber from the Senate with an amendment. 
Democrats who spoke during debate on the bill said its amendment from the Senate, which strikes all mention of private universities and changes language in the definition of “diversity, equity and inclusion,” said it doesn’t make a bad bill good, but it does make it slightly better. 
Rep. Rob Johnson, D-Des Moines, said DEI is not just some buzzword, but the “heartbeat of innovation in this country.” He emphasized in his comments that lawmakers voting on this bill will have to own up to the fact that they are working against the ideas and ideals of diversity, equity and inclusion, rather than some strategy to influence people. 
“This isn’t about handouts. This is about access,” Johnson said. “This is about opening the door and making sure that nobody is holding it shut from the inside, especially with our institutions of higher learning.”
The legislation passed with a vote of 59-32. 
 Senate passes budgets for education, agriculture and natural resources

After the debate on pipeline-related legislation late Monday, senators also passed two budget bills before concluding for the night.
Education: The educations appropriations bill, Senate File 647, allocating more than $1.033 billion, contained $451.4 million in funding for the Department of Education, including a $8.5 million increase and $578.5 million for the state Board of Regents with a $5.5 million increase. The increase for the state education department is largely containing a $7.5 million bump in funding for the state’s community colleges — part of the agreement reached with House Republicans, who had originally asked for $8 million.
Senate Democrats criticized the measure for not providing adequate funding for both Iowa K-12 schools and higher education. Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said Iowans who want to pursue higher education through state universities, community colleges or workforce training will be met with higher costs because of Republican underfunding.
“This is the worst budget for higher education that we’ve seen for well over a decade,” Petersen said. “You’ve created a hole in the budget with your corporate tax cuts and private school vouchers, and this is the first of many where Iowans are going to be disappointed to see that you’re underfunding services that they rely on and making it come out of their pocketbook.”
Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, the bill’s floor manager, said it was “ridiculous” to link the funding for the state’s Education Savings Account program providing public funds for private school tuition and associated costs to funding for the state Regents universities when ESA expenditures are less than $400 million while the state is spending nearly $600 million to “subsidize privileged people’s education in the Regents colleges.”
“We are funding education,” Green said. “And I said in this committee, when I was on the campaign trail, people were asking for us to cut government. And here we are — we’re still growing government, but we’re doing it in a restrained and responsible way, 1.5%. So we are prioritizing our priorities here, being smart with our money.”
Ag and natural resources: Senate File 646, the agriculture and natural resources budget, appropriates $46.6 million from the general fund — an increase of $682,000 from fiscal year 2025 — and $99.4 million from other state funds.
Sen. Tom Shipley, R-Nodaway, highlighted $1.3 million in new funding for foreign animal disease prevention and the continuation of $200,000 for the Choose Iowa Food Purchasing program, the same as in FY 2025. The program provides food banks financial assistance to purchase locally sourced food.
Sen. Art Staed, D-Cedar Rapids, thanked Shipley for increased funding for Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, but said the budget still lacks funding for efforts like water quality resource improvement and protections.
“The amended budget moves beyond the status quo of the first bill,” Staed said. “… However, this budget still falls short of what is needed to protect our natural resources with robust and conservation efforts.”
Both bills passed 34-14, along party lines.
 What is left?

The Senate and House Appropriations Committees must still pass the standing appropriations bill, the vehicle for funding for State Supplemental Aid that gives per-pupil funding for Iowa’s public K-12 schools as well as other remaining state spending obligations. The budget agreement has set a $4.837 billion allocation for that budget — with a majority going to SSA — though it may be amended to include other policy or spending measures. This bill includes the $14 million appropriation to fund increased pay for paraeducators and educational support staff.
In the compromise reached between Senate and House Republicans, this funding will come from the Sports Wagering Fund, a one-time pool of money that currently contains $40 million.

(Getty Images)A long-running dispute between insurance commissioners in Iowa and Pennsylvania has escalated, with Iowa regulators arguing that hundreds of elderly Iowans are now being put at risk due to a company’s willful violation of a court order.
In 2022, Iowa Insurance Commissioner Douglas Ommen sought an injunction against the financially struggling Senior Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania, or SHIP, arguing the company intended to “coerce vulnerable Iowans” into paying confiscatory rate increases of 400% or more, even while imposing “draconian” cuts to policyholders’ benefits.
At the time, Ommen said SHIP, which had sold long-term care insurance policies to more than 880 Iowans, was financially insolvent with a $1.3 billion funding shortfall.

The injunction, which was later granted, barred SHIP from offering any rates, riders or policy documents to any Iowa policyholders that had not been previously authorized and approved by the Iowa insurance commissioner.
In January 2025, SHIP informed the Iowa insurance commissioner the company had filed a request with the commonwealth court of Pennsylvania to begin implementing a court-approved “rehabilitation plan” for the company, allowing SHIP to contact Iowa policyholders and to offer, or in some cases force, changes to their policies.
The Iowa commissioner then informed SHIP that even if the Pennsylvania court granted the request and the company followed through, it would be in clear violation of the injunction issued in Iowa. Under that scenario, the commissioner warned, he would authorize the Iowa attorney general to seek sanctions against SHIP.
According to newly filed court papers in the case, SHIP “did not back down” and now intends to “unilaterally modify all Iowa SHIP policies” between May 31 and Oct. 28.
Iowa commissioner cites North Dakota case
According to the Iowa commissioner, there are now 501 SHIP policyholders in Iowa who in April were the target of a mass mailing informing them of potential modifications to their policies.
One of those Iowans is Clarence Busch, who has maintained his policy for over 30 years, and currently relies on it to pay for his assisted living care. Busch reported to the Iowa commissioner that the letter from SHIP was difficult to understand, and that he is now “concerned that I will lose the benefits I am receiving.”
Another Iowa policyholder, 74-year-old retired attorney Janet Huston, says in court filings that she has paid premiums on her long-term care policy continually since purchasing it at age 47.  “Purchasing the SHIP long-term care policy was part of my plan to care for myself in retirement,” Huston says in an affidavit filed with the court. “Now, 27 years later, I am concerned that the benefits for which I have paid premiums since the inception of the policy in 1997 or 1998 will not be available to me when I need them.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Iowa commissioner alleges it never authorized SHIP to contact any Iowa policyholders and that the Iowa court has never modified its injunction barring such contact.
SHIP has been litigating a nearly identical case in North Dakota, where a trial court recently awarded summary judgment in favor of the North Dakota Commissioner of Insurance and permanently barred SHIP from modifying the policies of North Dakota consumers without the commissioner’s approval.
After that decision was rendered, SHIP wrote to the judge in the case and claimed the North Dakota insurance commissioner didn’t “recognize the realities facing SHIP” and was unfairly seeking a “result that is simply not possible.” The company said it intended to “discontinue” its participation in the North Dakota court proceedings, adding that it did so “without any lack of respect for this honorable court,” but in recognition of the “hard realities” it faced.
In pursuing a contempt-of-court finding against SHIP, the Iowa commissioner is arguing that SHIP’s conduct is “beyond the pale” and that the company’s response to the North Dakota court’s decision “shows their state of mind.”
SHIP, the Iowa commissioner says, has “no intention of respecting the laws or court orders of any jurisdiction outside of Pennsylvania. Their contact with Iowa policyholders was not a fluke, or an accident, or a one-off violation; it was a deliberate plan months in the making, with the full knowledge that it would violate the temporary injunction.”
The Iowa commissioner not only seeks a finding of contempt, it is also requesting a civil penalty of $500 for each of 503 acts on contempt. The company has yet to file a response to that request.

(Photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs was sworn in Tuesday after a six-month wait, bringing to an end a months-long saga that saw tens of thousands of ballots challenged and ultimately counted.
Riggs took the oath of office, administered by her fellow Democrat on the court Justice Anita Earls, before the packed old House chamber of the North Carolina State Capitol. She received a minute-long standing ovation after swearing the oath and gave remarks on the importance of defending the right to vote and choosing justices who will uphold the rule of law.
“I learned from the people who fought, bled, and died for the right to have a democracy where we all get to be heard,” Riggs said. “The reason I was able to stand resolute, not discouraged and not intimidated, is because I knew that I stood arm-in-arm with you protecting that precious and fundamental right to vote.”
The ceremony came just six days after Republican state Court of Appeals judge Jefferson Griffin conceded the election, concluding a months-long effort to overturn the results of the race in an attempt to turn a 5-2 Republican majority on the state’s highest court to a 6-1 margin. That challenge was halted by a federal district judge appointed by President Donald Trump on May 5, but not before Republican judges on the North Carolina Court of Appeals and Supreme Court ruled in Griffin’s favor.
While she did not refer to Griffin by name, Riggs blasted his long and winding election challenge that sought to dispose of tens of thousands of ballots in an effort to overturn her victory.
“You won this election more than six months ago, but it was fewer than seven days ago that this race finally ended,” Riggs told the crowd of her supporters. “That’s more than 180 days after Election Day, nearly $2 million spent, more than 68,000 voters’ lawful votes put at risk, taxpayers’ time and resources wasted, immeasurable damage done to our democracy.”
She condemned all “efforts to undermine our rights and our democracy” and pledged to protect the rights of all North Carolinians, regardless of whether they voted for her.
“Disappointed politicians should not use courts to try and get a different election outcome,” she added. “It is crucial for you to use your precious right to vote to elect candidates and especially judges who will put the Constitution, the rule of law, and their solemn oath above their own personal political ambitions and ideologies.”
Ahead of the swearing in, Earls paid tribute to Riggs’ parents and husband for giving her much-needed support throughout all the tribulations of the election, prompting applause for both her mother and her husband who were in attendance at Tuesday’s ceremony. And she praised the newly sworn-in justice for her intelligence as well as her “passion and heart,” something Earls said was evident even when they first met during the redistricting process in 2009.
“She is a brilliant jurist, she finds the issues I miss — we don’t always agree, but that’s because we have the courage of our convictions, we understand deliberation, we can toss ideas off each other,” Earls said. “I am so grateful to each one of you for bringing her back, because I just couldn’t survive the next two years without her.” Earls’ term is up in 2026, and she is expected to seek reelection.
Among those in attendance at the swearing-in ceremony were Isaac Jenkins and Janice Sanders-Moye of Concerned Citizens for Community Action, a nonprofit that worked to ensure votes for Riggs were counted across the state. Sanders-Moye said she was “so glad” people stood up on Riggs’s behalf and called it a “great honor” to attend the ceremony.
“We worked 14 different counties to help get her elected, and that’s why we were so dissatisfied when they held up the election when they would do the recount because we knew that the vote was accurate. But we held out to the end,” Jenkins said.
Clad in a Riggs campaign sweatshirt she picked up during the election, Leisa Greathouse, a retired curator with the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, said it was a privilege to be an “eyewitness to history” at Tuesday’s ceremony.
“That’s one reason [I came]. Second reason, trying to secure the democracy that I see being chiseled away at, little by little, our Constitution,” Greathouse said. “This beacon of light is a great hope for the whole country, not just for North Carolina.”

,DC,2025-05-13 20:12:12+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House Republican plan would force states to pay for a portion of SNAP benefits,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-republican-plan-would-force-states-pay-portion-snap-benefits,,"The U.S. House Agriculture Committee’s portion of Republicans’ massive taxes and spending bill would partially shift to states the costs of the country’s largest food assistance program, which some experts and Democrats predicted will lead to major cuts in the program — and possibly even an end to it in some states.The measure will be taken up by the panel Tuesday night and is expected to be voted on late Tuesday or early Wednesday, after which it will be folded into a larger reconciliation package with 10 other bills passed out of committees and sent to the floor. The entire House is set to vote on the legislation before Memorial Day.The federal government currently pays for all Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. A provision in the Agriculture Committee’s piece of Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” to enact President Donald Trump’s agenda would transfer between 5% and 25% of that cost to states, depending on each state’s payment error rate, starting in 2028.The program provided about $100 billion in food assistance to nearly 42 million Americans last year, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Eligibility currently depends on tests related to income, assets, work requirements and more.But the change in cost structure could lead states to opt out entirely, said Ty Jones Cox, vice president for food assistance at the left-leaning economic think tank Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, leading some needy families unable to pay for groceries.“The language is unclear, but it could end SNAP entirely in some parts of the country if states decide the new state funding requirements are impossible for them to meet,” Cox said in a statement late Monday after the bill’s release. “The bill’s massive cuts disguised as ‘cost shifts’ pass the buck to states – but ultimately would leave families holding an empty grocery bag when states aren’t willing or able to backfill for lost federal funds.” Republicans plan to use the reconciliation package to permanently extend the 2017 tax law, increase spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, overhaul American energy production, restructure higher education aid and cut spending.“Our budget reconciliation text restores SNAP to its original intent—promoting work, not welfare—while saving taxpayer dollars and investing in American agriculture,” House Committee on Agriculture Republicans said on X on Monday night.Funding tied to error rateUnder the bill, states’ responsibility would rise with the broadly defined error rate of payments, which includes fraud as well as paperwork mistakes by a beneficiary or caseworker.States with an error rate of 6% or less would be responsible for paying 5% of benefits, and those with an error rate higher than 10% would shoulder one-quarter of the cost of benefits.Two other intermediate categories would exist for states with error rates between 6% and 10%.Based on current data, more than half of states would fall into the highest category of error rates. The national average is 11.7% and more than two dozen states and territories have rates higher than 10%.The states are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia. The District of Columbia also has an error rate over 10%, as do Guam and the Virgin Islands.Alaska’s nation-leading 60% error rate would be nearly impossible to bring under 10% by the time the provision goes into effect, Jones Cox said in a Tuesday interview.Only seven states — Idaho, Iowa, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin and Wyoming — would qualify for the lowest state cost-share.$290 billion in cuts overallThe measure would incentivize states to control the $13 billion per year in erroneous payments, a House Agriculture Committee summary of the legislation said. The bill as a whole would cut $290 billion in federal spending over a 10-year budget window, according to the summary.While congressional Republicans can claim they are not cutting benefits with the bill, the program would shrink with a lower federal cost-share, Jones Cox said.“They can say it’s not a cut, because they’re going to say it’s just shifting those costs to the states,” she said. “But it is a cut because states, if they cannot fill the gap… that brings down the program, period.”The changes would force state budget officers to choose from among a host of unattractive options: cutting SNAP, offsetting costs with corresponding cuts to other programs or raising revenues through taxes or other measures.States “have a few options,” Jones Cox said. “None look good.”Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move the package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship. Reconciliation measures must address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit in a way not deemed “merely incidental” by the Senate parliamentarian. That means the GOP proposals must carry some sort of price tag and cannot focus simply on changing federal policy.Democrats slam billOn a press call Tuesday, Democratic officials and an anti-hunger nonprofit blasted the proposal.Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, expressed skepticism that U.S. DOGE Service head Elon Musk could find a more efficient use of the $2 per meal SNAP provides during the call with other Democratic senators, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and the nonprofit, Hunger Free Vermont.“This is not a waste, fraud and abuse deal,” Welch said. “This is really about taking away basic nutritional security that is so absolutely essential to the well-being of our families and our kids in Vermont and in every single state across the nation.”Kotek, who started her political career as a policy advocate for the Oregon Food Bank, said she saw firsthand the effect of food insecurity. More than 700,000 Oregonians receive benefits from SNAP, and every dollar spent on SNAP generates another $1.50 to $1.80 in economic activity at grocery stores, farmers’ markets and other local businesses, Kotek said.“When you cut SNAP, you’re not cutting bureaucracy,” she said. “You’re cutting a child’s dinner. You’re cutting their breakfast. You’re cutting their family’s dignity.”One in four New Mexicans rely on SNAP, said Sen. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M. The farmers and ranchers he represents also plan their farming season based on what grocery stores and food banks will need, and farmers already planted seeds with the idea that those vegetables will be used for school lunches and other food programs.“The way to look at this is it’s not fiscally responsible,” Luján said. “It’s taken away from the hungry across America to make billionaires and millionaires even wealthier, and it’s going to even explode the deficit.”Oregon Capital Chronicle Editor Julia Shumway contributed to this report.",,,,2025-05-13 17:07:47.297892

Jon Oberg, who once headed the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, said a governor-proposed, legislatively embraced transfer of $15 million out of the state lottery-funded Trust to deal with the state budget shortfall is illegal, and if approved, would likely spur another lawsuit from him.

He was referring to a 2020 lawsuit that led to the dropping of a proposal by the Trust to defund $1.8 million in conservation projects and instead award that money to install ethanol blender pumps at Nebraska gas stations.
The lawsuit, filed by Oberg and W. Don Nelson, a former chief of staff under then Gov. Bob Kerrey, led to the dropping of the blender pump swap and an awarding of legal fees to Oberg and Nelson.
Oberg told the Examiner that Nebraska voters, when they established the state lottery, intended proceeds earmarked to the Environmental Trust to be used for environmental and conservation projects, not to fill gaps in the state budget.
Under proposed state budget bills, which are expected to come up for a final vote on Thursday, $15 million of the Trust’s funds would be transferred over the next two years to three state funds aimed at water sustainability and conservation.
Gov. Jim Pillen, who proposed the transfers, did not immediately respond at mid-day Tuesday to a request for comment about the threatened lawsuit by Oberg.
Transfers at issue
But the transfers come as state leaders scramble to close a shortfall in the state budget once estimated at $430 million. Proposals include transferring funds out of the state cash reserve, cutting programs and tapping excess funds held by state agencies.
Because the Trust gets about $20 million in state lottery proceeds each year to hand out in competitive grants, the proposed transfers from the Trust would grab most of that money next year, $13 million, followed by a $2 million transfer in 2027.
“This might be the last stand of the Nebraska Environmental Trust,” Oberg said.

One transfer proposed by Pillen was not recommended by the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee. It would have diverted $5 million in Trust funds to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.
The Pillen proposals were labeled as a “raid” on Trust funds when they were first introduced this year.
The Trust, when established in 1992, was intended to fund projects that “conserve, enhance and restore the natural environments of Nebraska.” Its grants, which are awarded on a competitive scoring basis, typically fund projects to restore silted-in lakes, establish and protect wildlife habitat and finance recycling projects.
Its work is often guarded by a mix of hunters, farmers, environmentalists and conservationists.
Oberg said that this year’s fund transfer is “worse” than the one that led to the lawsuit in 2020 in part because it is so much larger.
“This time around, it looks as though it’s going to be a permanent kind of thing,” he added. “This will open up the spigots so (Trust funds) can go to all kinds of different purposes.”
State seeking legal lane
This year’s proposed fund transfers from the Trust include some caveats that the money cannot be used for administrative purposes, but for purposes that align with the purpose of the Trust. But Oberg said that it would still be a transfer of funds away from the Trust, which is supposed to decide how best to utilize the funds.
In April, he wrote a blog post entitled “Asking for Another Lawsuit” because, he said, “I was afraid that people didn’t remember that we’d gone to court.” (His blog is entitled “Three Capitals” because he has worked and lived in Lincoln, Washington, D.C. and Berlin. His past jobs include posts with the U.S. Senate Budget Committee and the U.S. Department of Education.)

He confirmed this week that a new lawsuit was likely, adding that courts typically do not look kindly on a repeat violation of a state law.
Oberg, who used to work in the fiscal office of the Legislature and later led the state agency that includes the state budget division, said his interest in stopping such transfers from the Trust is about “fiscal integrity.”
He added that there are other, better ways to resolve a state budget problem than trying to raid Trust funds.
Past budget gaps, Oberg said, have been closed by borrowing, and then repaying, funds from state agency cash reserves or by raising taxes temporarily.
In addition to halting the funds transfer from the Environmental Trust, he said that a lawsuit would allow for an examination of Trust records to determine if the Trust Board purposely disqualified dozens of grant applications to build up excess reserves. The Trust Board came under fire in 2021 and 2022 for disqualifying a higher number of grant applications than in the past, including some grants that had routinely won approval.
In 2022, 40 out of 87 grants were deemed ineligible. The disqualifications led to an increase in excess cash held by the Trust, but also discouraged many past grant recipients from applying again, leading to a sharp decrease in applications.

(Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Local sheriffs are on the front lines in deciding whether to participate in the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. But states increasingly are making the choice for them.
More and more, sheriffs’ hands are tied no matter whether they do — or don’t — want to help with deportations, though they often get the blame when conservatives draw up lists of sanctuary cities.
“‘Naughty lists,’ as we call them, are not super helpful here,” said Patrick Royal, a spokesperson for the National Sheriffs’ Association. “We all know there are places like Colorado where you can’t [help with deportations], and places like North Carolina where you have to.”
Cooperation between sheriffs and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lies at the heart of the Trump administration’s immigration detention policy. The administration plans to punish noncooperative jurisdictions with funding cuts — though many legal experts agree that cooperation is voluntary unless state or local laws say otherwise.
Trump orders list of ‘sanctuary cities’ to target for funding freeze

Sheriffs, who typically run local jails, must decide what to do when faced with immigration detainers — requests from ICE to hold onto incarcerated people up to two extra days so ICE officers can show up and arrest them. ICE issues those detainers when the agency reviews fingerprints sent electronically for background checks as part of the jail booking process.
Otherwise, arrested suspects who post bond or are otherwise released by a judge might go free despite their immigration status, prompting ICE in some cases to pursue them in the community.
In North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden ran on a platform of limiting cooperation with ICE  when he was elected in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, in 2018. But today, McFadden must comply with detainers because of a state law passed last year.
In a now-retracted Facebook post, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in late April accused Mecklenburg and several other North Carolina counties of “shielding criminal illegal immigrants” as sanctuary jurisdictions. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said in the post he was writing federal legislation to prosecute sanctuary jurisdictions.
“You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both,” McFadden said. He added that he’d like more choice about whether to comply with detainers. A federal funding cutoff would endanger important jail programs such as rape counseling, he said.
“Everybody’s focused on immigration like that’s the biggest fire, and nobody wants to address the other things. The losers will be the prisoners who need all these services we provide,” McFadden said.










You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both.

Conservative sheriffs in Democratic-controlled states also can be frustrated by state policy on detainers. Sheriff Lew Evangelidis of Worcester County, Massachusetts, said he’s been criticized for releasing prisoners wanted by ICE but sometimes has no choice: A 2017 state Supreme Court ruling prohibits holding prisoners based on detainers.
“If they [ICE] want this person and consider them a threat to public safety, then I want that person out of my community. I want to keep my community safe,” said Evangelidis. He supported a Republican-sponsored effort in the state legislature to allow 12-hour holds for ICE if a judge determines the prisoner is a threat to public safety, but the amendment was voted down in April.
States act on detainers
Many experts agree that ICE detainers can be legally ignored if states allow sheriffs to do that.
“That detainer request is just that, a request, it’s not a requirement,” said Cassandra Charles, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is opposing Louisiana’s lawsuit to reverse a court-ordered ban on cooperation between Orleans Parish and ICE.
The general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, Eddie Caldwell, agreed that the detainers are voluntary under federal law.
The association supports a state bill now under consideration that would require not only the 48-hour detention but also a notice sent 48 hours before release to let ICE know the clock is running. The proposal has passed the House.
The notification matters, Caldwell said, because there can be criminal proceedings that take weeks or months, so ICE in many cases doesn’t realize the 48-hour window has started.
Wells community divided over ICE agreement with local police

Tillis’ office said the senator’s disagreement with McFadden, a Democrat, and other sheriffs is about that notification.
“It’s not necessarily that [sheriffs] are breaking the law, but rather making it as difficult as possible for ICE to take prisoners into custody by refusing to do some basic things. Notification is important,” said Daniel Keylin, a senior adviser to Tillis.
States including California, Colorado and Massachusetts ban compliance with the ICE detainers, on the general principle that it’s not enough reason to hold people in jails when they’re otherwise free to go because of bail or an end to their criminal cases. Those three states have made recent moves to defend or fine-tune their rules.
California’s attorney general also has issued guidance to local jurisdictions based on a 2017 state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities. That law withstood a court challenge under the first Trump administration.
Colorado has a law against holding prisoners more than six hours longer than required, and a new bill sent to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week would specify that even those six hours can’t be for the purpose of an immigration detainer.
Iowa, Tennessee and Texas are among the states requiring cooperation with detainers.
And Florida has gone further, requiring sheriffs to actively help ICE write detainers though official agreements in which local agencies sign up to help enforce immigration laws.
Cooperation boosts arrests
Such cooperation makes a big difference, experts say — jails are the easiest place to pick up immigrants for deportation, and when local sheriffs and police help out, there are more arrests.
“A larger share of ICE arrests and deportations are happening in places where local law enforcement is cooperative with ICE,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director for the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program, speaking at a recent webinar.
“A declining share of arrests and deportations are happening from places like California, where there are really strict limitations on local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE,” she added.
ICE is making about 600 immigration arrests daily, twice the rate as during the last year of the Biden administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking at the same event.
Reports on deportations are incomplete, Chishti said, but he estimated the current administration is on track to deport half a million people this year and is trying to get that number higher.
“The Trump administration has not been able to change the laws that are on the books, because only Congress can do that,” Chishti said. “It’s going to take congressional action for the Trump administration to achieve its aim of higher [arrest and deportation] numbers.”
Immigration detention increase reveals expanded federal operations in Maine

President Donald Trump has added more pressure, last month requesting a list from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of sanctuary cities, which he says would face funding cuts. The administration also has sued some states, including Colorado, Illinois and New York, over their policies.
Asked for comment on the legality of funding cutoffs for sanctuary policies, Bondi’s office referred to a February memo in which she promised to “end funding to state and local jurisdictions that unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.” The memo cites a federal law saying local officials “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” communication about immigration status.
Local jurisdictions in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington joined a February lawsuit led by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California against a Trump administration executive order calling for defunding cities with sanctuary policies, calling the order “illegal and authoritarian.”
In April, a U.S. district court in California issued a preliminary injunction in that case preventing any funding cutoff over sanctuary policies to the cities and counties in the lawsuit. And on Friday, the federal judge, William Orrick, ruled that the injunction applies to any list of sanctuary jurisdictions the administration may target for funding cuts.
Trump’s new executive order seeking the list cannot be used as “an end run” around Orrick’s injunction, the judge wrote, while he decides the legality of detainer policies and other issues.
“The litigation may not proceed with the coercive threat to end all federal funding hanging over the Cities and Counties’ heads like the sword of Damocles,” Orrick wrote.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)There’s no reason why money for road repairs and flood protections should hinge upon states’ cooperation with federal immigration policies, contend 20 Democratic states attorneys general.
That’s why the AGs, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, are asking a federal judge to stop federal agencies from a “grant funding hostage scheme” that requires detaining undocumented immigrants who don’t commit crimes in order to receive key federal grants and aid.
Two new federal lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) aim to protect and preserve billions of federal dollars already awarded to states for emergency preparedness, disaster relief and infrastructure projects. 
Directives issued in April by DHS and DOT secretaries informed states that their federal funding required compliance with federal immigration policies. The AGs — representing Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Vermont — allege this violated constitutional protections for separation of powers.
“By hanging a halt in this critical funding over States like a sword of Damocles, Defendants impose immense harm on States, forcing them to choose between readiness for disasters and emergencies, on the one hand, and their judgment about how best to investigate and prosecute crimes, on the other,” the lawsuit against DHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Coast Guard, and their leaders, states. 
“Defendants’ grant funding hostage scheme violates two key principles that underlie the American system of checks and balances: agencies in the Executive Branch cannot act contrary to the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government cannot use the spending power to coerce States into adopting its preferred policies. Defendants have ignored both principles, claiming undelegated power to place their own conditions on dozens of grant programs that Congress created and bulldozing through the Constitution’s boundary between state and federal authority.”
The AGs say state and local public safety officials have more important work to do than cater to the whims of a new administration, which stand in contradiction to state-level directives like, for example, authorizing licenses for undocumented immigrants. Rhode Island lawmakers granted driving privileges for undocumented residents in 2022, with a July, 1 2023 effective date, joining 19 other states and D.C.
Federal protocols followed by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies could force state and local police to use state license laws as a way to find and detain undocumented immigrants.
“As a former U.S. Attorney and former federal prosecutor, I know how many ICE agents are in Rhode Island and it’s under 10,” Neronha said during a virtual press conference Tuesday. “What they need in order to carry out their agenda is for us to do the work for them, pulling us away from important law enforcement work in Rhode Island.”

More uncertainty for Washington Bridge 
No state has seen federal funding cut off since directives were issued by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Not yet.
States’ abilities to respond to natural disasters and security threats, and complete key infrastructure projects, including the much-anticipated rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge in Rhode Island, hinge upon a continued flow of congressionally authorized federal grants and aid.
The $221 million Biden-era infrastructure grant awarded to Rhode Island for the Washington Bridge project only became accessible in late March, after weeks of uncertainty in the wake of the administration change. Gov. Dan McKee’s office and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday regarding continued access to the funds in the wake of Duffy’s April 24 directive tying federal infrastructure grants to compliance with federal diversity and immigration policies.
The Duffy directive fails to provide any statutory or legal explanation for why transportation funding relates to immigration enforcement. The new requirements  jeopardize more than $628 million in federal funding in Rhode Island, and billions of dollars more across the country, the AGs argue in their lawsuit against Duffy and DOT.
“If Plaintiff States reject Defendants’ unlawful Immigration Enforcement Condition, they will collectively lose billions in federal funding that is essential to sustain critical public safety and transportation programs, including highway development, airport safety projects, protections against train collisions, and programs to prevent injuries and deaths from traffic accidents. The loss of this funding will cause state and local providers to scale back or even terminate many of these programs and projects,” the complaint states. “More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States.”










 More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States.


– Twenty state Democratic AGs in lawsuit against U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy 


Similarly dire predictions accompany the loss of security and disaster funds, which includes $3 billion in FEMA money to states each year, according to the lawsuit against DHS. Rhode Island received more than $45 million in FEMA grants in 2024 alone, according to the lawsuit.
The new complaints reprise language of the 20 state AG lawsuits against the Trump administration that preceded them, calling the executive agencies’ actions “arbitrary and capricious” and in clear violation of constitutional separation of powers and spending clauses.
Neronha during the press conference pointed to the success that AGs have had in other lawsuits, temporarily preserving funding and policy protections for education, immigration, research funding, public health, and grants and aid to state governments, among others. 
Not that he expects the frenzy of legal activity will abate anytime soon.
“As we stack wins against the Trump administration for violation of the Constitution and other federal laws, what we are seeing is a creeping authoritarianism in this country,” Neronha said. “The president is trying to take power for himself. He’s trying to sideline Congress, and now, he’s attempting to undermine the judiciary.”
Neronha likened the latest federal directives attempting to force states to redirect their own law enforcement to serve federal civil immigration policies to “holding a gun to states’ heads.”
Rhode Island, home to four of the 20 federal lawsuits against the Trump administration already, was again picked as the setting for the latest complaints due to the “strong team” within Neronha’s office, he said. 
Neronha and other AGs bringing the two cases against the administration also stressed the sum of their collaborative parts.
“We’ve built the best and biggest law firm in the country, and we’re fighting for all Americans,” Neronha said. 
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
The lawsuit against DOT was assigned to U.S. District Chief Judge John Jr. McConnell Jr., while the case against DHS was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith, according to the public court docket.

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
The most likely Medicaid cuts would hit rural areas the hardest

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”












As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services




But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

“Everybody’s focused on immigration like that’s the biggest fire, and nobody wants to address the other things. The losers will be the prisoners who need all these services we provide,” McFadden said.

Conservative sheriffs in Democratic-controlled states also can be frustrated by state policy on detainers. Sheriff Lew Evangelidis of Worcester County, Massachusetts, said he’s been criticized for releasing prisoners wanted by ICE but sometimes has no choice: A 2017 state Supreme Court ruling prohibits holding prisoners based on detainers.
“If they [ICE] want this person and consider them a threat to public safety, then I want that person out of my community. I want to keep my community safe,” said Evangelidis. He supported a Republican-sponsored effort in the state legislature to allow 12-hour holds for ICE if a judge determines the prisoner is a threat to public safety, but the amendment was voted down in April.
States act on detainers
Many experts agree that ICE detainers can be legally ignored if states allow sheriffs to do that.
“That detainer request is just that, a request, it’s not a requirement,” said Cassandra Charles, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is opposing Louisiana’s lawsuit to reverse a court-ordered ban on cooperation between Orleans Parish and ICE.
The general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, Eddie Caldwell, agreed that the detainers are voluntary under federal law.
The association supports a state bill now under consideration that would require not only the 48-hour detention but also a notice sent 48 hours before release to let ICE know the clock is running. The proposal has passed the House.
The notification matters, Caldwell said, because there can be criminal proceedings that take weeks or months, so ICE in many cases doesn’t realize the 48-hour window has started.
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

Tillis’ office said the senator’s disagreement with McFadden, a Democrat, and other sheriffs is about that notification.
“It’s not necessarily that [sheriffs] are breaking the law, but rather making it as difficult as possible for ICE to take prisoners into custody by refusing to do some basic things. Notification is important,” said Daniel Keylin, a senior adviser to Tillis.
States including California, Colorado and Massachusetts ban compliance with the ICE detainers, on the general principle that it’s not enough reason to hold people in jails when they’re otherwise free to go because of bail or an end to their criminal cases. Those three states have made recent moves to defend or fine-tune their rules.
California’s attorney general also has issued guidance to local jurisdictions based on a 2017 state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities. That law withstood a court challenge under the first Trump administration.
Colorado has a law against holding prisoners more than six hours longer than required, and a new bill sent to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week would specify that even those six hours can’t be for the purpose of an immigration detainer.
Iowa, Tennessee and Texas are among the states requiring cooperation with detainers.
And Florida has gone further, requiring sheriffs to actively help ICE write detainers though official agreements in which local agencies sign up to help enforce immigration laws.
Cooperation boosts arrests
Such cooperation makes a big difference, experts say — jails are the easiest place to pick up immigrants for deportation, and when local sheriffs and police help out, there are more arrests.
“A larger share of ICE arrests and deportations are happening in places where local law enforcement is cooperative with ICE,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director for the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program, speaking at a recent webinar.
“A declining share of arrests and deportations are happening from places like California, where there are really strict limitations on local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE,” she added.
ICE is making about 600 immigration arrests daily, twice the rate as during the last year of the Biden administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking at the same event.
Reports on deportations are incomplete, Chishti said, but he estimated the current administration is on track to deport half a million people this year and is trying to get that number higher.
“The Trump administration has not been able to change the laws that are on the books, because only Congress can do that,” Chishti said. “It’s going to take congressional action for the Trump administration to achieve its aim of higher [arrest and deportation] numbers.”
Here’s the latest on how states are cooperating with Trump’s deportation plans

President Donald Trump has added more pressure, last month requesting a list from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of sanctuary cities, which he says would face funding cuts. The administration also has sued some states, including Colorado, Illinois and New York, over their policies.
Asked for comment on the legality of funding cutoffs for sanctuary policies, Bondi’s office referred to a February memo in which she promised to “end funding to state and local jurisdictions that unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.” The memo cites a federal law saying local officials “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” communication about immigration status.
Local jurisdictions in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington joined a February lawsuit led by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California against a Trump administration executive order calling for defunding cities with sanctuary policies, calling the order “illegal and authoritarian.”
Sanctuary studies

In April, a U.S. district court in California issued a preliminary injunction in that case preventing any funding cutoff over sanctuary policies to the cities and counties in the lawsuit. And on Friday, the federal judge, William Orrick, ruled that the injunction applies to any list of sanctuary jurisdictions the administration may target for funding cuts.
Trump’s new executive order seeking the list cannot be used as “an end run” around Orrick’s injunction, the judge wrote, while he decides the legality of detainer policies and other issues.
“The litigation may not proceed with the coercive threat to end all federal funding hanging over the Cities and Counties’ heads like the sword of Damocles,” Orrick wrote.

(Courtesy of CDC/ Brandon Clifton)Mid-May marks the end of widespread influenza infections across the country, wrapping up a flu season New Mexico health officials described as “one of the most severe” in recent memory.
Hospitalizations and infection rates from influenza ran significantly higher this year, New Mexico Department of Health Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source NM.
“The respiratory viruses following the pandemic are reestablishing themselves,” Smelser said, “We don’t want higher rates of these diseases in our populations because of the hospitalizations and deaths; it’s more important than ever that we recommend people stay up to date on immunizations, such as  influenza, RSV and COVID.”
A contagious respiratory virus, influenza can infect people year-round, but often spreads further in late fall through the early spring. The virus has several types and can mutate rapidly, often requiring new vaccines to address the specific strains to be developed each year.
While not as high as last year’s rates, influenza-like illness reports to the New Mexico Department of Health peaked later, in January this year, mirroring the national flu trends. The flu spread intensely in the state’s Southeastern portion, notably in Lincoln and Lea counties, according to NMDOH data.
Between Sept. 29 and May 3, New Mexico reported 1,916 hospitalizations for influenza, with seniors older than 75 accounting for nearly one-third of the cases and adults ages 18 to 49-years old another 20% of them.
Deaths from influenza and pneumonia, which can be a complication of influenza, decreased from the prior year by 32.5%. Between September and May, New Mexico recorded 145 deaths from pneumonia, 76 adult influenza deaths and three pediatric influenza deaths.
About 27% of eligible New Mexicans received a flu shot this year and more than half of those were older than 65-years-old, according to NMDOH.
New Mexico’s flu season tracked with nationwide trends. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classified the 2024-2025 flu season as “high severity” overall for children, adults and seniors, the first high severity season since 2017-2018.
As of May 3, influenza had infected approximately 47 million people, hospitalized 610,000 people and caused 27,000 deaths nationwide — including 226 children.The CDC estimates the hospitalization rate was the highest in the last 15 years.
The CDC also notes a decline in influenza vaccinations nationwide with 147 million shots distributed this season — 10 million fewer than last year.
Smelser said consistent flu vaccination can protect against future strains of flu, as the virus mutates.
“We had a very severe year that caused a lot of impact both on the personal level and for their families, communities, loved ones but also economically, with missed days at work, at school,” Smelser said. “We really want people to stay up to date on all of their vaccines.”

(Getty Images)Less than one week after the state House passed a recreational marijuana bill that would put the commonwealth in charge of sales, a Senate committee voted it down.
Sen. Dan Laughlin (R-Erie), chair of the Senate Justice & Law panel, has authored legislation that would legalize adult-use cannabis, but said he’s “made it pretty crystal clear” that he doesn’t believe in the state store model included in House Bill 1200.
Laughlin mentioned that he supported the provisions in House Bill 1200 about no public smoking and handling of DUI’s. But, he went through a list of disagreements he had which centered around sales being run by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, regulations surrounding home-grow, and the impact it would have on the state’s budget and economy.
House Bill 1200 failed by a 7-3 vote in the Senate Law & Justice Committee on Tuesday.
“I don’t view this as a small business-friendly proposal, either,” Laughlin said on Tuesday. “And the small business, free market approach to adult-use cannabis is very dear to me.”
Laughlin also said he thinks the state selling cannabis and alcohol sends a wrong message to the citizens of the commonwealth and advocated for the creation of a Pennsylvania Cannabis Control Board, should recreational marijuana be legalized.
Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) and Sen. Devlin Robinson (R-Allegheny), who also both voted against it, highlighted the fact that the federal government still classifies marijuana as an illegal substance.
“How do we pay state employees with money that is coming from a federally illegal entity or action?” Ward asked. “We pay state employees. We’re going to pay them in cash?”

Sen. Lisa Boscola (D-Northampton) said she supports the legalization of marijuana, specifically the proposal drafted by Laughlin and state Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia). But, she said she couldn’t support House Bill 1200.
“I don’t think it’s a serious attempt to advance legalizing marijuana legislation, and I know it has no chance of passing the Senate,” Boscola said. “So, until we get a little bit more serious and you show me a bill that can pass the Senate and we can all support, I’ll be there for you on this issue. I just can’t do it today. I need a better bill.”
Sen. Christine Tartaglione (D-Philadelphia) said she supported the bill crafted by Laughlin and Street, but also voted in favor of House Bill 1200 on Tuesday.
“This is a start, and we can build on this,” Targtaglione said. “Think of it as a vehicle that we can use.”
Tartaglione also criticized what she viewed as the lack of notice given to the committee about the vote and said all four caucuses need to sit down to hash out an agreement on a marijuana legalization proposal.
Laughlin said he believes there’s “certainly space for compromise” on a marijuana legalization proposal, but also expected more back-and-forth between the lawmakers to come up with a bill that could pass both chambers.
“We are not going to get there with this model, at least,” Laughlin said.
“I believe that if there’s a path to getting adult-use cannabis passed, the governor himself is going to have to roll his sleeves up and help do some of the work,” Laughlin added. “I have not seen that yet.”
Shapiro has called for marijuana legalization since he’s taken office, describing the matter as an issue of competitiveness and justice.

Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) on the House floor on May 1, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonMichigan House Democrats on Tuesday came out in support of a resolution put forth by state Rep. Sharon MacDonell (D-Troy) aiming to censure Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) for “racist statements” made on the House Floor earlier this month. 
Schriver, who was stripped of his staff, funds and committee assignment by former House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) last year for promoting the racist Great Replacement Theory on social media, spoke out on a set of policies intended to crack down on sanctuary cities and counties during the chamber’s May 1 session. 
In his testimony, Schriver quoted former Presidential Advisor Patrick Buchanan’s book, “The Death of the West”, telling fellow lawmakers “The chasm in our country is not one of income, ideology or faith, but of ethnicity and loyalty.”
“Illegal aliens undermine our national sovereignty. The largest population transfer in history is coming from all the races in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and they are not acclimating, they are not melting and they are not reforming to the American way of life,” Schriver said. “This is something that needs to be addressed.”

MacDonell told reporters on Tuesday that while it’s not surprising to hear Schriver oppose sanctuary cities, his testimony had focused on criticizing people rather than policy.
“Schriver blamed naturalized citizens and their descendants for America’s ills…I think any rational person can agree that it’s one thing to have strong opinions on immigration policy in Michigan. It’s fully another thing to claim that all immigrants, including naturalized citizens, are bad people. Even worse to claim that all people of certain ethnicity that he doesn’t like, or a certain national origin that Schriver doesn’t like, are bad people,” MacDonell said. 
House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton), whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from India, called Schriver’s comments “deliberate, disgusting, dangerous and disgraceful.”
“They were an attack on families like mine, and an attack on the very spirit of inclusion and the progress that our state is making. His remarks were rooted in ignorance and prejudice and they do not reflect the values of House Democrats or the values of the Michigan people,” Puri said. 
“Rep. Schriver also specifically singled out countries whose people are overwhelmingly Black, brown and non-white, not once mentioning European nations or white immigrants. That’s not a coincidence. That’s racism, plain and simple. He didn’t just invoke racist tropes, he leaned into the dangerous Great Replacement Theory suggesting that immigrants of color are here to erase American identity. That’s not policy, that’s paranoia rooted in white supremacy,” Puri said.

He also raised concerns that members of the Republican Caucus hadn’t spoken out against Schriver’s remarks, calling on House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and other Republicans to denounce Schriver’s “hateful rhetoric.”
“When white supremacy echoes in the chambers and you say nothing, you’re not neutral, you are complicit,” Puri said. 
When asked about Schriver’s remarks at a press conference earlier on Tuesday, Hall said he hadn’t seen Schriver’s comments, before noting that Schriver had been reelected by his constituents. 
Video of House Session shows Hall on the House floor as Schriver requests permission to testify on the bills, though he is not visible on video when Schriver’s speech concludes.   
“What I really appreciate about representative Shriver is that he’s, you see a difference, I think, between him last year and this year and, you know, we gave him his staff back… what I’m doing is I’ve got him as a member of our caucus, and you know what I’ve tried to do is put him in positions to succeed, and he’s on some of these oversight subcommittees. I think he’s doing a very good job there. And you see him really voting with our caucus on a lot of issues,” Hall said.

“I appreciate how he’s working with our members as a team, and even though we might have differences at times in how we talk and how we communicate, and I’ve expressed some of those in the past where him and I disagreed,” Hall said, with the Speaker previously stating that Schriver’s resolution calling on the United States Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell V. Hodges, which requires all states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, would not move forward. 
When asked if Schriver’s far-right views were shaping legislation coming from the House Republican Caucus, Hall pointed to Schriver’s vote in support of bipartisan policies like legislation to create a Public Safety Trust Fund to support local law enforcement and community violence intervention initiatives. 
Schriver’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the proposed resolution.

On May 9, U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy granted Anderson Towing’s motion for a preliminary injunction. The lawsuit, filed earlier this year, claims St. John used a personal relationship with former Yellowstone County District Court Judge Russ Fagg to blacklist Anderson Towing from working with the city.
State law dictates the Montana Department of Justice, “establish and maintain an equitable rotation among qualified tow truck operators.” Anderson Towing was suspended from the state tow rotation for six months in October 2024 and permanently removed from the Billings Police Department’s tow rotation in February 2025.
Fagg took issue with Anderson Towing after a car crash in February. He later went to retrieve the car and took issue with the company only accepting cash or cashier’s check.
The company recorded several of its interactions with Fagg, who did pay the bill. He then filed a complaint with the Montana Office of Consumer Protection in Helena.
Billing practices were used as a reason for St. John to take Anderson Towing out of the city’s rotation. The company was told the reason, in a letter, was excessive invoices. 
The City of Billings also filed a records request for other complaints about the towing company.
The request discovered complaints including “inconsistencies in disclosing prices, inconsistencies in pick up hours, unreasonable charges,” and went on to say the request had also found complaints citing overcharges.
The tow company had no chance to be heard in regards to their removal from the tow rotation, the court order said. Anderson also told the court the decision by the city of Billings has cost them 15% of their business and about $52,000 in lost revenue per month.
However, the document also said Anderson was unable to show how many customers are gained through the rotation, nor how many tow rotation calls are fielded in any particular month.

SPRINGFIELD — Fallen Aurora firefighter Cristian Medrano was honored at the state’s 32nd annual Fallen Firefighter Memorial held outside the Statehouse on Tuesday.

The memorial is held each May in front of the commemorative statue on the Statehouse’s back lawn as a tribute to Illinois firefighters who have died in the line of duty. The statue consists of four life-size bronze firefighters in their gear, a child, a ladder, and a hose. A red wall of bricks encircles the statue, with bronze plaques adorning the inside of the wall that display the names of fallen Illinois firefighters.

Medrano’s plaque joined the wall Tuesday.

Medrano was born and raised in Aurora, where he graduated from Aurora University with his bachelor’s degree before joining the Aurora Fire Department. In April of last year, Medrano took part in “strenuous search and rescue exercises as part of his training at the Aurora Fire Academy.” Less than a day later, he died after experiencing a “cardiovascular event,” according to the U.S. Fire Administration. He was 27 years-old.

“Firefighter Cristian Medrano is the newest name in a long line of public servants who gave their last breath to protect our collective safety,” Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said. “He leaves behind a memory of selflessness and a dream of doing what's right, no matter the cost.”





A wreath dedicated to Medrano was displayed in front of bricks surrounding the memorial during the service.

“Today, I stand with you in both the joy and the sorrow,” Stratton said. “I have joy for the life that Cristian led, for the spark of purpose he followed when he became a firefighter. I have sorrow for what could have been, for the love he left behind. I have joy for the dedication within this community to ensure that no fallen hero is ever forgotten, and I have sorrow for the simple truth that their names are now suspended in memory.”

Following the memorial, a medal of honor ceremony was held in downtown Springfield to recognize other Illinois first responders.

Fourteen firefighters received the Firefighter Excellence Award for their specific acts of service on duty. Twenty-two emergency personnel received a Certificate of Recognition for their dedication. Five departments were awarded a Unit Citation Award for their unit’s specific acts of service on duty.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — Priya Saxena was staying up late to read comments about her doctoral dissertation around 1 a.m. on April 7 when she saw the message in her email.
“I was numb at the time,” she testified through tears Tuesday in a Rapid City courtroom, where she continued her fight to remain in the country.
The email from U.S. immigration officials said her visa was revoked. Saxena called some friends and holed up in her bedroom.
“I was scared,” she said, “and I had no idea what to do next.”
Her fear was based on the realization that “I could be deported at any time,” she said. A student from India, she was less than a month away from graduating with master’s and doctoral degrees from South Dakota Mines, something she’d been working toward for five years.
Noem’s honorary degree sparks protest; meanwhile, a student she’s trying to deport earns a doctorate

Her visa revocation was triggered by a criminal records check of international students undertaken by the Trump administration. The check turned up a four-year-old misdemeanor traffic conviction against Saxena, for failing to pull over for an emergency vehicle in Meade County. 
The check also turned up a charge of driving under the influence against her from the same 2021 traffic stop, but her blood tested within the legal limit and the charge was dismissed. She had disclosed those legal matters to immigration officials when she obtained her most recent visa in 2022.
The criminal records check was part of a broader action by the Trump administration against more than 1,000 international students nationwide, not only for items appearing on their records but also for activity the administration described as “anti-Semetic,” such as publicly protesting Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. 
The administration initially terminated students’ records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, which is used by colleges to verify and manage international student eligibility. Then the administration backtracked, leaving students such as Saxena with restored educational status but in limbo with their visas and their future.
Saxena testified that she decided to book a plane ticket to India and leave the country voluntarily, but then postponed the ticket and ultimately canceled it after speaking to a defense attorney in Rapid City, Jim Leach. Since then, they’ve sued U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — the former governor of South Dakota — and Noem’s agency. The lawsuit alleges it’s illegal for the government to instigate an immigration enforcement action against Saxena for something the government already knew about before it issued her current visa.

With her degrees now in hand, and her visa not scheduled to expire until 2027, Saxena would like to apply for a program that allows international students to remain in the country and work in fields related to their degrees. Saxena has a doctorate in chemical and biological engineering and a master’s in chemical engineering.
U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier granted Saxena a temporary restraining order last month and extended it long enough for her to walk across the graduation stage and collect her degrees on Saturday at South Dakota Mines — the same day Noem appeared at another South Dakota institution, Dakota State University in Madison, to receive an honorary degree and deliver a commencement address. Noem was met by hundreds of protesters outside that ceremony.
On Tuesday, as Saxena was in court in Rapid City, Immigration and Customs Enforcement was conducting a “worksite enforcement action” in Madison, where the agency made an undisclosed number of arrests at two Madison businesses.
ICE makes arrests in South Dakota city where Noem was subjected to a protest three days earlier

Saxena’s restraining order is scheduled to expire at the end of this week. Her court hearing Tuesday was about her request for a temporary injunction. That would stop the government from pursuing any further immigration enforcement proceedings against her while her lawsuit is pending. Judge Schreier heard testimony and arguments and said she’ll issue a written decision in the next few days.
Leach argued that Saxena needs protection from unlawful and unpredictable actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He referenced the agency’s widespread deportation efforts under President Donald Trump and its shifting policies.
“Everybody’s afraid of ICE now, and she’s afraid,” Leach said of Saxena.
Michaele Hofmann, an assistant U.S. attorney, argued that a temporary injunction would improperly restrain the government from taking further action if Saxena engages in additional criminal activity, or if Saxena violates the terms of her U.S. residency in other ways. Hofmann argued that if a temporary injunction is granted, it should be narrowly tailored to allow the government to act in response to those possibilities.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Priya-Saxena-with-Leach-at-graduation-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-13 16:09:20.442026

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Legislature's video feed)TOPEKA — The Kansas attorney general and a Shawnee County judge approved a wrongful-conviction settlement of more than $200,000 for a man who stood trial three times for a series of criminal sexual offenses before a jury acquitted him of two charges and failed to reach a verdict on the final charge.
On Tuesday, an attorney for the state informed the governor and legislators that Anthony Bowers was entitled to compensation of $182,650 for three years served in prison on an overturned conviction for rape. The settlement included about $25,000 for legal fees.
Robert Hutchison, deputy attorney general in Kansas, said the State Finance Council had to be informed of the decision previously approved in Shawnee County District Court. The payment didn’t require an endorsement by members of the State Finance Council, which included Gov. Laura Kelly, Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins.
State law mandated Attorney General Kris Kobach process petitions filed by people convinced they were owed compensation for wrongful convictions. Each petition must be considered by the state court, which in this case fell to Judge Teresa Watson.
“We wrestled with this for a long time because this isn’t the kind of offense for which we like to see compensation paid out,” Hutchison said.
 
Three trials & prison
In Jackson County, Hutchison said, Bowers was acquitted by a jury of rape, aggravated sodomy and aggravated indecent liberties with a child during his first trial.
At a second trial in 2016, he was convicted on all three charges and sentenced to three consecutive life terms with a mandatory minimum of 25 years in prison.
The Kansas Court of Appeals reversed his convictions because prosecution witness Jill Shehi-Chapman testified at trial about subject matter that fell into the category of expert testimony. The appellate court objected to Shehi-Chapman testifying as to her opinions regarding the general behavior of perpetrators of sexual abuse when she was not certified as an expert witness in the Bowers case.
“And, thereby, prejudicing the verdicts he received,” Hutchison said.
At the third trial, a jury acquitted Bowers of rape and aggravated sodomy and was hung on the aggravated indecent liberties charge.
The prosecutor in Jackson County declined to retry Bowers a fourth time on the aggravated indecent liberties issue because of the Court of Appeals opinion, elapsed time from the alleged offense in 2014 and “consistency issues” involving the evidence, Hutchison said.
 
Candy, soft drinks
Meanwhile, the State Finance Council voted to release $10 million to the Kansas Department for Children and Families to cover state expenditures during the remainder of the current fiscal year.
The council likewise agreed to transfer $1.8 million to DCF following compliance with a legislative directive to seek approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a plan to deny recipients of SNAP the option of using the federal funds to buy candy or soft drinks.
The state agency submitted the request to the USDA, but withdrew that application when the governor vetoed the budget measure tied to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Republican-led Legislature overturned Kelly’s veto of the soda and candy prohibition, which prompted DCF to resubmit the request to USDA to limit food stamp expenditures in Kansas.
Senate Majority Leader Chase Blasi, a Wichita Republican, asked the DCF secretary if there was any plan to withdraw the request a second time.
DCF Secretary Laura Howard apologized for the start-and-stop process regarding the SNAP limitation enacted by the Legislature. She said the proposal to USDA wouldn’t be dropped a second time.
“I’ll take responsibility for what happened earlier,” Howard said. “That was really an administrative error on my staff’s part.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Robert-Hutchison-with-kobach.png,,,2025-05-13 16:09:20.442026

John Vincent, who announced his candidacy April 17 in Florence, announced in a Facebook post Tuesday he was suspending his campaign to challenge 7th District Congressman Russell Fry for the seat that spans the Grand Strand and much of the Pee Dee.
  John Vincent, a 64-year-old Myrtle Beach resident, has suspended his campaign. (Provided by John Vincent)
The decision comes exactly two months after Vincent filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission establishing his campaign.
“When we decided to enter the congressional race 60 days ago, the country was on fire, rule of law threatened and the needs of this district greater than ever. That has not changed,” Vincent wrote on Facebook. “What is different for us, after an intense two months, is that the mood in this district, maybe the state, is apathetic.”
Neither Vincent nor the state Democratic party responded Tuesday to requests for comment.
When Vincent, a Myrtle Beach resident, officially kicked off his campaign at a restaurant in Florence, he told the SC Daily Gazette he felt certain he could pull off an upset.
His tone changed in Tuesday’s post.
“We can’t win without people who believe, and this district is not close today,” he said.
Navy veteran hopes to be first Democrat this century to represent Grand Strand, Pee Dee in Congress

The closest a Democrat has gotten to winning the 7th District since South Carolina gained it back following the 2010 census was in 2012, the first election with the recrafted voting map. That year, Democrat Gloria Bromell Tinubu received 44% of the vote, losing to Tom Rice, then-chairman of Horry County Council.
Rice, who angered Republicans in the ruby red district for voting to impeach President Donald Trump in 2021, was ousted by Fry.
The 40-year-old won re-election in November with 65% of the vote, the most decisive win for the seat this century.
Vincent, a Navy veteran who retired in 2003 as command master chief petty officer — one of the branch’s highest ranks for enlisted sailors — was hoping to become the first Democrat to represent the Grand Strand since it was part of the state’s 6th District. Jim Clyburn, the state’s lone Democrat in Congress, has represented the reconfigured 6th District since 1992.
In Tuesday’s post, Vincent said he’s received positive feedback, but his crowds are small, and contributions are coming in small batches — probably from “people who can barely afford it.”
Vincent had $7,500 in his campaign account as of March 31, according to the latest FEC filings. When he spoke with the Daily Gazette last month, he said his account had grown to $30,000.
That compares to more than $625,000 Fry had on hand at the end of March, according to his FEC filing.
“Those who can afford it, have a wait-and-see attitude, steeped in apathy that might not change until it’s too late to win,” Vincent wrote.
Albeit brief, Vincent’s experience as a candidate doesn’t bode well for the party in a state where the GOP is becoming more dominant with every election cycle.
While he’s not completely closing the book on his campaign, Vincent said he will focus on political activism so future Democrats eyeing a congressional bid don’t have the same experience he did.
“We need to wake up this district, the state, and the country, to what is happening and what we could lose,” he said. “We will aim to create better conditions for candidates.”
Other potential challengers
Since Vincent announced his bid last month, two other Democrats have submitted paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for the U.S. House in next year’s elections.
Alex Harper, an assistant solicitor in York and Union counties, filed his statement of candidacy form on April 25 for the 5th District, represented by Ralph Norman since 2017. The Rock Hill developer is mulling a run for governor.
Harper is participating in a meet-and-greet event Tuesday evening in Tega Cay.
David Robinson II of Columbia filed with the FEC on Saturday to again challenge 2nd District Congressman Joe Wilson.

Steven Holt, R-Denison, hugs landowner and activist Kathy Stockdale after the Iowa Senate passed legislation dealing with the use of eminent domain in carbon capture pipeline projects the night of May 12, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa senators voted 27-22 late Monday to pass a bill to limit the ability of carbon sequestration pipelines to use eminent domain, sending it to the governor’s desk after a drawn-out debate.
The decision follows four years of Iowans and House lawmakers urging for eminent domain reform in response to the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.
House File 639 comprised a number of bills passed by the House aimed at eminent domain. Senators tried repeatedly to change the scope of the bill with various amendments, none of which were adopted.
Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink, R-Fort Dodge, said amid debates on eminent domain and carbon capture pipelines, that senators were “missing the point” that the bill was poorly written and likely to create problems.
“The point is a crappy bill that we’re going to be voting on here in a little bit,” Kraayenbrink said.
Four years coming
Landowners opposed to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline have traveled to the Capitol countless times over the past four years, urging lawmakers to move on the issue.
Many of those opposed to the pipeline own land in its path and fear its impact to their land, property values and safety.
The pipeline would transport carbon dioxide, captured from ethanol facilities, across Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, the Dakotas and into underground storage in North Dakota. The Iowa Utilities Commission granted the project eminent domain rights in June, though the project cannot begin construction until it has permits in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota.
Proponents of the pipeline say it will allow Iowa to enter new, low-carbon ethanol markets, which would in turn help corn and soybean farmers.
The company’s permit in South Dakota was recently denied, following the state’s passage of a law preventing hazardous liquid pipelines carrying carbon dioxide from using eminent domain in the state. Summit has said it plans to reapply.
HF 639, as written, changed definitions of a common carrier, increased insurance requirements to cover any damages to property and reimburse landowners for increases in premiums due to the pipeline, set requirements for the IUC and expanded who can intervene in IUC proceedings.
A group of 12 senators signed a letter last week saying they would not vote on budget legislation until the eminent domain bill was debated. Their move stalled action on budget bills and contributed to pushing the session into overtime.  Lawmakers have not received part of their per diem expense payments since May 2.
After the pipeline bill passed, senators approved the budgets for education and agriculture and natural resources, sending them to the House.
Senators planned to debate the issue on Friday, and drew a crowd of interested constituents to the Capitol, but the chambers leaders did not bring the bill to the floor.
Bousselot’s amendment fails
Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, the bill’s floor manager, proposed an amendment that would rewrite the bill, similar to what he had proposed in committee, that would have allowed companies to pursue voluntary easements outside of the project corridor, in order to avoid using eminent domain.
Bousselot called the original bill a “Trojan horse” bill written by “climate extremists” trying to kill the Summit pipeline project.
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, who sponsored HF 639, said it’s “ridiculous” to suggest the bill is about environmental extremists.
“This is not about environmental extremism at all, it’s about protecting landowners,” Holt said. “I think that the arrogance the Senate is showing, the disrespect to property owners is frankly unacceptable.”
Bousselot’s amendment would have kept HF 639 provisions requiring Iowa Utilities Commission members’ attendance at permit hearings, created a one-year deadline for permit decisions, and would have held project operators responsible for damage to the land during the lifetime of the project.
Under the amendment, the eminent domain changes would have applied to all projects seeking government permission to force unwilling landowners to give up easements for a court-determined price, not just carbon sequestration projects.
Bousselot said the amendment “protects Iowans, protects landowners of all types, for all project types.”
His amendment would have stopped carbon sequestration pipelines from using eminent domain, unless the project had been granted a permit by the IUC before the enactment date, or had a sole purpose of connecting to another project that was already granted eminent domain.
“It ends eminent domain on CO2 pipelines in a constitutional manner, on a go forward basis,” Bousselot said.
Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, said it’s “not correct” to say the bill is all about killing the Summit project.
“We’re just saying you have to follow the law,” Taylor said.
Taylor said the requirement to use eminent domain is public use.
“It’s not a positive business climate, it’s not helping the agribusinesses in the state, it’s not the price of corn or helping the ethanol plants, it’s public use,” Taylor said.
Bousselot’s amendment failed narrowly, 28-22.
Democrats push for simplified, eminent domain only amendment
Democrats submitted an amendment, with language from House File 943, which the House passed in March, to ban the use of eminent domain on pipelines transporting liquified carbon dioxide.
Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, sponsored the amendment and said it would get at the “fundamental question” of eminent domain, which constituents have asked the body to debate.
Wahls said bipartisan conversations over the past several weeks have been “fractured” and “raucous.”
“I think most of the people in this room are quite tired, but I’m quite positive that there is nobody in this room more tired than the landowners who are sitting in the gallery because they’ve been taking time out of their lives, not being paid to come to this building, and ask for their voice to be heard,” Wahls said.
Bousselot argued that the amendment was not germane, since it was a “major change to the scope of the bill” and Senate President Amy Sinclair, R-Allerton, agreed and the amendment was scrapped.
On the ‘crappy’ bill
Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, asked Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, about some of the issues he had with the bill, including multiple definitions of a common carrier and an “elevated standard” for judicial review that he said would “bog the system down.”
Klimesh also noted a lack of specificity in some of the language of the bill, like the section expanding intervenors in utility board cases that does not specify that members of the general assembly, city or county officials must be in Iowa.
“I mean is that the intention really, to bog this system down with interveners from any place or anywhere, any elected official, any city council, county official, or any resident with plausible interest in the proceedings?” Klimesh said.
Following the decision, Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, said the arguments brought up on the Senate floor about the bill providing for out-of-state individuals to intervene with the Iowa permitting process were incorrect, and “it reflects a misunderstanding of the IUC system and administrative law.”
He said the process of intervention only gives individuals the right to file motions and get copies of meetings by email.
“It’s not an invitation to sue,” Thomson said. “And there is a limitation on there, that you have to have some connection with what’s going on. It’s absurd to say that we’re opening the process up to endless litigation.”
Klimesh asked on the floor how the insurance clauses of the bill would be determined.
He said the bill, as written, would make it more difficult for all pipeline projects in the future, tie up “critical infrastructure projects” in court and pass costs onto consumers who would have increased utility costs.
Klimesh said in the future, companies that want to build pipelines in the state would be deterred by the requirements in the bill that would be costly.
Alons said much of the language was a “codification” of what is already in the IUC rules.
Klimesh said the bill would lead to increasing costs on energy for Iowans.
“Cost drivers, cost increases — they’re based off decisions we make here in this chamber,” Klimesh said. “This is one of those decisions that is going to affect pipeline companies, again, far beyond CO2 pipeline companies, and places an onerous burden on them to ascertain and achieve this coverage.”
Klimesh also worried that enactment language in the bill would open the door to lawsuits from Iowans who have already signed an easement contract with the state when Summit is no longer able to uphold that contract without eminent domain to complete the project.
“I’m concerned about putting the state of Iowa and our taxpayers at a legal risk,” Klimesh said.
“This bill sets up a whole avalanche of potential bad policy. While we were trying to squash a fly, we took a nuclear bomb to it.”
Taylor said senators tried to swap HF 639 for a different version, via the Democrats’ amendment, but “it was rejected out of hand.”
“So it makes me wonder if it wasn’t really just any opposition to tampering with the Summit pipeline, rather than the particulars of 639,” Taylor said.
Taylor said the group of GOP senators who stepped forward to push for a debate on this faced criticism for it, but Taylor said he was standing for Republican values and the motto of Iowa.
“When it says our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain, there’s not an asterisk there,” he said. “It doesn’t say unless we’re threatened by a billion dollar lawsuit.”
Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, said he was “flummoxed” that the Democrat’s amendment was turned down, because it made the argument “really simple.”
“You can be for the pipeline, you can be for ethanol production, you can be for union workers putting that pipeline together, and say, ‘we can do this without having to use eminent domain,’” Zimmer said.
Klimesh said when he met with the 12 senators who pushed for a debate on the bill, he offered to work with them and to amend the bill to resemble HF 943, but the group declined.
“In that week’s time, we could have sat around and crafted probably a much better piece of legislation,” Klimesh said.
Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said “hogwash” and that there was an opportunity for a cleaner bill on the floor and the majority chose to ignore it.
Sen. Tony Bisignano, D-Des Moines, criticized the majority party for not working on the bill sooner.
“Where have you been? This bill didn’t start a week ago … we’ve had years,” Bisignano said.
Sen. Dan Zumbach, R-Ryan, said “emotions got ahead of reality” on the issue and as a result, the body is stuck with “horrible” legislation.
“This bill is about killing a project, not about constitutionality, not about property rights — we missed that boat, folks,” Zumbach said. “Had it laid out there in front of us and we were too stubborn to listen to the actual words.”
Bousselot said in his closing comments on the bill that everyone will leave the Capitol Monday claiming they “voted to protect private property rights” because everyone either voted for his amendment, or for the bill.
“I hope we have a plan for infrastructure, to grow our state, for the jobs that are going to be harder to build, for the farmers that produce the wealth and the great crops and commodities that we rely on,” Bousselot said.
The bill advanced from the Senate and will now go to Gov. Kim Reynolds for final approval. Reynolds has not said publicly whether she would sign or veto it. Summit Carbon Solutions did not respond to a request for comment.
Reactions
Kathy Stockdale, a landowner from Iowa Falls, said she was happy to see the bill pass and was “extremely proud” of the 12 GOP senators who took a stand to force the legislation to come to a vote. At the same time, Stockdale said she was “deeply upset” as a Republican, with Senate leadership, and that she and many landowners would have preferred to see House File 943 pass.
“It doesn’t protect our private property rights,” she said.
However, she said the bill passed does provide some benefits to landowners: “It helps us in the IUC hearings. It does provide insurance for us. … It defines what a common carrier is, just like in South Dakota.”
While the measure passed the Senate, she said she is not sure it will be signed by Reynolds.
Thomson and Holt, who led the legislation in the House, hugged and shook hands with activists and landowners outside the Senate chambers after the bill’s passage.
Holt said Bousselot talking about being supportive of property rights was “disrespectful” considering his role in similar bills stalling in the Senate in recent sessions.
“Everybody that’s followed this knows that it has been Senator Bousselot, who formerly worked for Summit, who killed these pieces of legislation over and over again,” Holt said. “It’s so disingenuous and so disrespectful treating the citizens of Iowa like fools, so it was not a proud moment for me as a Republican.”
Holt said the bill’s Senate passage Monday was because of landowners and supporters who worked for years to push lawmakers to vote on the bill. He also credited House Republicans for introducing and passing measures in response to these calls in recent legislative sessions.
“We listened to the people of Iowa, and that is why this finally got done,” Holt said. “That is why the governor needs to sign it just as soon as possible.”

Mike Kehoe speaks during the Disability Advocacy Day rally in the Missouri State Capitol Feb. 26 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe’s last-minute plan to convince the Chiefs and Royals to stay in Missouri cleared the state House Tuesday, though its fate in the Senate remains murky with only days left before the legislature adjourns for the year..
If lawmakers fail to send the bill to his desk this week, Kehoe said he’s ready to call them back to the Capitol for a special session later this year.
The bill passed on a 108-40 vote in the House, despite never having been introduced as a formal bill or ever having a public hearing. Instead, it was added as an amendment Tuesday afternoon to a Senate bill pertaining to student athletes.
Under the plan, the state would help pay up to half the cost of a new stadium for the Royals and a refurbished Arrowhead Stadium for the Chiefs, though the overall cost of the plan was not clear as the House was debating the proposal Tuesday.
The money would cover annual bond payments for the stadium projects up to the amount a team generated in state tax revenue the year prior to applying for the incentives.
“This is the exact same funding Missouri would lose out on if the teams moved to Kansas,” said state Rep. Chris Brown, a Kansas City Republican.
The teams would also be eligible for up to $50 million in tax credits for investing in their stadiums. A clawback provision would be triggered if either team relocates stadium, headquarters or a training facility to another state. Missouri will keep all of the new state revenue generated by the team for the duration of the program.
While a plan floated last week would have been targeted at helping the Royals move to Clay County, Kehoe’s proposal would allow the team to decide where it wants to build its new stadium.
“As long as it’s in Missouri,” Kehoe said of the new stadium. “The plan works as long as they stay in Missouri.”
Both the Chiefs and Royals have publicly expressed interest in moving from Missouri to Kansas after Jackson County voters rejected a proposal last year to extend a 3/8-cent sales tax to help finance a downtown Kansas City baseball stadium and upgrades to Arrowhead.
Kansas lawmakers responded by expanding a tax incentive program in the hopes of convincing one or both teams to relocate. The leases for both teams’ Jackson County stadiums run through the end of the 2030 season.
“We live in a world of competition,” Brown said. “Business to business. State to state. Country to country… We need to compete with Kansas, and we need to compete now.”
The Royals and Chiefs are major economic engines for Missouri, said state Rep. David Tyson Smith, a Columbia Democrat.
“We would be crazy to let this team get away from us,” he said. “I can’t believe we even have to debate this.”
State Rep. Jim Murphy, a St. Louis County Republican, estimated losing both teams would cost the state $50 million in tax revenue. Instead, the plan presented by the governor would allow Missouri to take that $50 million and invest in the teams.
“We lose that money either way,” he said.
 Rushed process inspires resistance

 Emily Weber, a Democrat from Kansas City, speaks in the House in February (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)..
Several legislators expressed concerns about the rushed nature of the debate, arguing that the proposal hasn’t been properly vetted.
“This is a tough one,” said state Rep. Emily Weber, a Kansas City Democrat, later adding the governor and GOP leadership should have brought everyone to the table sooner.
“I’m extremely disgusted and disappointed with this process,” Webber said.
State Rep. Del Taylor, a St. Louis Democrat, said lawmakers shouldn’t pass something if they don’t know what it will cost.
And state Rep. Richard West, a Wentzville Republican, accused the legislature of “playing Russian roulette with the people’s money.”
“This is not a good economic decision,” West said.
State Rep. Jeff Coleman, a Grain Valley Republican, said the last-minute nature and the lack of details on the price are concerns he can’t ignore.
“I’m a no on this bill,” he said. “And I’m sad to be, because no one loves the Chiefs more than I do.”
Others noted that just last week, House leaders stunned their colleagues and the Senate by refusing to allow a vote on a $500 million spending bill that would have funded projects for health care, education and law enforcement across the state.
But state Rep. Keri Ingle, a Lee’s Summit Democrat, said that while she shares in the frustration with the House’s decision last week, she hoped it wouldn’t cost her community its professional sports teams.
“I can talk for hours about what these teams do for the economy of this state and of the Kansas City region,” she said, later adding: “Please don’t punish the Kansas City region and the state of Missouri for generations.”
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, shared in the frustration with how the stadium funding debate has played out.
“We are being asked to provide a vote on something that we have only been able to vet for the last 12 hours, for some of us. Three for others of us. And that’s hard. That’s hard to do,” she said. “It’s a big ask for the legislature, but I think that when we get 10 years down the line, I don’t think any of us wants to be part of a General Assembly that lost the Chiefs or the Royals.”
In the end, 40 Democrats joined with 68 Republicans in support, while four Democrats and 36 Republicans voted against.
 Doomed in Senate? 

Resentment over the House’s decision, however, colored reaction to the stadium proposal in the Senate.
“Seems a little hypocritical to me,” said state Sen. Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
State Sen. Brian Williams, a University City Democrat, said he can’t support stadium funding after the House’s decision last week killed so many needed projects across the state.
“If we take care of the most vulnerable Missourians,” he said, “then we can start talking about helping billionaires keep a stadium in Missouri.”
A two-page handout circulated among lawmakers in preparation for Kehoe’s Tuesday morning presentation made the case for the incentive package. It claimed the Chiefs generate $28.8 million in annual tax revenue for Missouri and $572.3 million of economic activity within Jackson County alone.
The stakes are high, Kehoe said, and Missouri must act — either now, or later this year in a special session.
“It’s an economic development proposal… any time the state has seen a major economic development proposal, whether that’s been Boeing or GM or Ford, governors of both parties have called special sessions to do that,” Kehoe said. “I think an economic development proposal on the west side of the state is that significant.”
State Sen. Ben Brown, a Washington Republican, said with so little time before adjournment, getting a stadium deal done will be “a heavy lift.”
“It’s going to be tough,” he said. “But you know, the governor, he’s been excellent at forming relationships with people within the legislature, and I know that his opinion carries a lot of weight. So we’ll just have to see if it can make it across the finish line before time runs out.”

Meanwhile, Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office argued that the students are making claims about a “metaphysical” injury and lack standing to sue.

Now, Shepherd must consider whether to accept the attorney general’s motion to dismiss the case or allow the students’ claim to proceed. He also must consider a motion to dismiss by House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers, the top Republicans in the General Assembly and defendants in the suit.
The Kentucky Student Voice Team (KSVT), which has about 100 members across the state, is a nonprofit organization and a spinoff of the Prichard Committee, a statewide group that in the 1980s organized grassroots support for school reform in Kentucky. KSVT’s position relies heavily on the Kentucky Supreme Court ruling in Rose v. Council for Better Education, often cited as the Rose decision, which was a 1989 landmark decision that prompted widespread changes to Kentucky’s public education system. 
After that decision, the General Assembly in 1990 passed a penny increase in the sales tax to fund the Kentucky Education Reform Act. At the time, the Supreme Court said that Kentucky students “must be provided with an equal opportunity to have an adequate education.” The Rose decision also provided the basis for similar lawsuits to be filed in other states. 
The students filed their lawsuit against the state and General Assembly in January. They allege that the state government has “failed to maintain the level of commitment to education required” by Kentucky’s Constitution and past court decisions and “failed to meet their obligation to monitor the efficiency of the education system.” The students also claim the Kentucky Board of Education and Department of Education “have failed to ensure the state’s educational system is constitutionally compliant.”
  Attorney General Russell Coleman
Attorney General Coleman’s office represents the state in the case. Coleman filed a motion to dismiss KSVT’s complaint in February. He argued that the students are asking Shepherd to “do what the Rose court was unwilling to do: supplant the role of the General Assembly in deciding what constitutes ‘appropriate legislation’ to provide for an efficient school system.” 
“The relief the Plaintiffs seek is not of the kind this Court can grant — and even if it could, the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated standing and have failed to join indispensable parties,” Coleman wrote. 
While Shepherd questioned him, Aaron Silletto of the attorney general’s office argued that past court cases on constitutional claims require anyone seeking remedies to show how they have been affected individually. He said the students’ initial complaint, which was 70 pages long and included several allegations about the current state of Kentucky education, had generalized situations that weren’t specific to the students listed as parties in the lawsuit. 
“A concrete injury means not something that is just theoretical or metaphysically possible or something like that. … Here, we have a laundry list of complaints about the system, but not one of these claims has said in either the amended complaint, the original complaint, or in response, anything more about how that system has injured them, as opposed to just being a deficiency  in the system that’s in the air,” Silletto said. 
  Michael Abate
Michael Abate, one of the attorneys representing the students, countered, saying that denying someone a constitutional right is harmful in itself. Among their allegations, the students say they missed out on educational opportunities by not being provided with opportunities in school to think critically or discuss complicated and sensitive issues. 
“The loss of a constitutional right is an injury,” Abate said. 
Shepherd represented the Prichard Committee in the original Rose case. In his pressing of Silletto on the issue of the students’ standing, Shepherd said that he views public education not as “an individual activity” but rather a commodity for a community at large. 
Osborne and Stivers are seeking to be dismissed as parties to the lawsuit. Eric Lycan, who is the general counsel for the House speaker’s office, said in court that they have legislative immunity under previous court decisions. In 2022, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that legislators were immune from claims brought by the executive branch challenging the constitutionality of certain laws. 
“I would also say that this legislature takes very seriously the constitutional duty to provide citizens with common schools, and if it is the will of the court that the current system is unconstitutional, the legislature stands ready and willing to remake the educational system from the ground up,” Lycan said.  
Members of the KSVT held a press conference after the hearing. The students emphasized that the changes they are seeking go beyond a win in the courtroom and called for others invested in public education to support them.
“Our leaders have a choice to make — continue to ignore the glaring issues in our public schools that are threatening to destroy them or use this once-in-a-generation opportunity to make lasting change for the betterment of Kentucky students for generations to come,” said Ivy Litton, a member of KSVT. “Kentucky has led the nation in terms of academic excellence before, and we can do it again.”
Because recent flooding in Frankfort damaged the courthouse downtown, the Tuesday hearing was held in the Kentucky Court of Appeals building on Chamberlin Avenue.

Many of the things adults choose to do are dangerous. Are we going to ban them all? 
The post A statewide nicotine ban? Why stop there?   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MASSACHUSETTS IS considering a statewide “generational” ban on cigarettes and other nicotine products – just like Brookline and a number of other Bay State towns. The idea is that anyone born January 1, 2006, or later will not be permitted to buy these products. Eventually, as the population ages, that means that 80 years from now, only centenarians will still be puffing away. But why stop there? Alcohol is a killer too: It’s responsible for about 178,000 deaths each year — and now some researchers are saying there’s no such thing as a safe amount. So while the Legislature is busy writing up its nicotine ban, why not add in alcohol? Sure, we tried this in 1920 and, in one stroke, we basically created organized crime. But this “generational” approach is much more clever. Only those who are now 19 or so would be prohibited from buying booze. The rest of us can go on enjoying our martinis even while having the satisfaction of knowing that the next generation will no longer be subject to its ills. In fact, as I think about it, there are lots of things people do that are dangerous. Take skiing. About 600,000 skiers and snowboarders are injured annually in the US. And for what benefit? They all take chairlifts to the top of a mountain (a waste of energy!), then slide down a trail of often artificial snow (another waste of energy!), only to repeat the process ad nauseum until they are exhausted. Swimming is another ridiculous pastime: 4,000 drowning deaths each year! And then there’s the automobile, which kills more than 42,000 annually. Let’s ban them all. As with nicotine, we’ll simply say that those born after 2005 will no longer be allowed to ski, swim, or drive a car. Of course, over time that means that eventually no one will be allowed to ski, swim, or drive a car. Think of the lives saved! The injuries avoided! And for so little cost.  Skiing is silly anyway, swimming is unneeded now that we have showers, and those in cars can just use bicycles (although we may need to ban those as well: 1,000 bicyclists in the US die each year and another 130,000 are injured).  And while we’re at it: Each year there are more than 20 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. And, despite our best efforts, the rates are increasing. The solution? Ban sex! Or at least, ban sex for the kids. As they grow older, those youngsters will never know what they’re missing – and best of all, they will be safe and STD-free.  I can hear your objection: Isn’t sex necessary for the propagation of the species? At one time, yes. But now? We’ve got IVF! No need to risk your life while making a baby. Science, ever our friend, has made that messy (and disease-ridden!) coupling up unnecessary. My point is a simple one. Many of the things adults choose to do are dangerous. There was once a time when we said, “Well, it’s risky, but it’s your decision.” But Brookline – and perhaps soon Massachusetts – is leading the way in saying, “No, no, no! It’s not your decision! We will tell you what you can and cannot do.” And even better, since I – as well as pretty much all of the folks who will be voting on these new laws — was born before 2006, the new bans won’t affect me at all. Smoking, drinking, skiing, swimming, driving, and sex. It’s been a lot of fun and — at least for me — will continue to be. I’m sorry you kids will never get to experience any of it. Tom Keane is a Boston-based freelance writer. The post A statewide nicotine ban?

The media office for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a written statement that the agency’s action was at Manitou Equipment America and Global Polymer Industries, “in response to information or allegations received by ICE Homeland Security Investigations.”

The statement said ICE enforces business compliance with federal employment eligibility requirements and has the responsibility to conduct worksite enforcement initiatives “targeting employers who violate employment laws.”
“During these operations, any alien determined to be in violation of U.S. immigration laws may be subject to arrest, detention, and, if ordered removed by an immigration judge or other authority, subject to removal from the United States,” the statement said.
The statement did not say how many were arrested in Madison, but said “those arrested during the enforcement action at Manitou Equipment America and Global Polymer Industries have been presented for Federal prosecution for violations of U.S. law or were placed into deportation proceedings.” 
Noem delivered the commencement address and received an honorary degree Saturday at Dakota State University in Madison. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the graduation ceremony to protest the actions of Noem and the Department of Homeland Security that she leads, which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.

Eight were standalone monuments, the […]","A postcard from the 1950s or 60s depicting the Confederate Memorial at the north end of the Alabama State Capitol. Work on the monument began in 1886 and was completed in 1898. The Southern Poverty Law Center published its fourth report on the status of Confederate monuments in the U.S. last month. (Alabama Department of Archives and History)Almost 2,100 symbols celebrating the Confederacy remain in the United States, and the pace of removal has slowed down, according to the “Whose Heritage” report published by the Southern Poverty Law Center in April.
In Alabama, about 175 monuments remain while 18 have either been removed or renamed since 2018. Eight were standalone monuments, the names of two buildings and three schools have been changed.
According to the report, 15 Confederate monuments were either removed or renamed in 2015, then increased to 64 in 2017. The removals peaked in 2020 in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, when almost 170 were either changed or eliminated.
The numbers have declined since, going to 73 in 2021, then to 13 in 2023. Last year, just two Confederate monuments were eliminated.
“Part of the point of the report is to take a long view of the history of the movement against Confederate symbols, and this movement has been going on since the 19th Century, the movement to put them up and the movements to put them down,” said Rivka Maizlish, senior research analyst with the SPLC who helped write the report.
The Confederate States of America was a white supremacist government dedicated to preserving the enslavement of Black Americans. The constitution of the government expressly forbade the abolition of slavery. In the late 19th century, monuments to the Confederacy were erected as celebrations of white supremacy or of Jim Crow governments.
While monuments can be found throughout most of the eastern part of the U.S. as well as the west coast, they are especially concentrated in the deep South. Georgia has 296 Confederate monuments, the most of any state. Virginia has 276 and Texas has 245.
This is the fourth year that SPLC has published the report on Confederate monuments.
“There have been close to 480 that have been removed, and there are still a majority that are coming down rather than being put back up or in a stasis situation,” Maizlish said. “But the number that are getting taken down has gotten smaller in the last five or 10 years.”
Julie Noegel Hardaway, president general of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), said that the monuments serve to remember soldiers who died fighting for the Confederacy.
“We are very concerned because a lot of these men never came home, and that is the reason why we built these monuments in the first place, was because we didn’t have a grave to decorate, so we still go to these monuments today and we lay flowers and we lay wreaths, to remember these men who came to the aid of their states.” she said. “Their state governments called them up, very much like Vietnam veterans did. It doesn’t matter whether they agreed with their government or not, they were called to do this duty, and they came forward and did it honorably. That is why we remember them. ”
The Alabama Legislature in 2017 enacted the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act, sponsored by Sen. Gerald Allen, R-Cottondale. It prohibits local governments from removing monuments located in public spaces along with preventing public buildings, such as schools and municipalities, from getting renamed without approval from a committee that the legislation established.
The legislation created a committee responsible for reviewing requests to have monuments either removed or renamed.
“It protects Confederate monuments, it also protects civil rights monuments as well,” said Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, who sponsored a version of the law in the House.
The report documents Jeremiah Treece, a student at Booker T. Washington High School in Montgomery, petitioned the city to change its flag and remove Confederate symbolism.

“Every day in this city, we are walking on land that was old plantations, on streets that were built by my ancestors. That history is part of this city,” Treece said in the report. “Of course, there’s a lot of amazing things that have come from this city as well, like the Civil Rights Movement.”
Civil rights groups such as SPLC are urging the public to remove the monuments because those who placed them there originally did so as part of a propaganda campaign to control historical narrative.

Hamburger Mary’s was an Orlando restaurant and bar that hosted drag shows including “family friendly” performances to which children were invited. Its parent company filed the underlying lawsuit against the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis from enforcing the law. The business closed its Orlando location in June and is seeking to reopen in Kissimmee.
The 2023 law threatened fines, loss of operating licenses, and criminal penalties against any venues that expose any “child” to “lewd” performances, even if the child has parental consent. Hamburger Mary’s argued it had to engage in self-censorship and consequently was losing business despite 15 years of trouble-free performances.
Judge Gerald Bard Tjoflat issued a lengthy dissenting opinion.
 “In litigation generally, and in constitutional litigation most prominently, courts in the United States characteristically pause to ask: Is this conflict really necessary?”  he wrote. 
“Here, the Majority fails to ask this question and, by skipping it, puts the First Amendment on a collision course with core principles of federalism and judicial restraint. Because this conflict was entirely avoidable, I respectfully dissent.”
Tjoflat took aim at the appellate court for its earlier ruling, in October 2023, upholding what he described as a “sweeping injunction” that prevented “yet another run-of-the-mill obscenity statute”  from taking effect.
“On appeal of the injunction, we had two good options: we could apply ordinary tools of statutory construction to read the statute narrowly and avoid unnecessary constitutional conflict, or we could certify the unsettled state-law questions to the Florida Supreme Court, allowing the state’s highest court to speak first,” he wrote. 
 “ … Instead, the Majority chooses a third, unwarranted path: it reads the statute in the broadest possible way, maximizes constitutional conflict, and strikes the law down wholesale.”
The state asked the Supreme Court to lift the injunction while it appealed the underlying merits of Hamburger Mary’s challenge. In a November 2023 6-3 ruling the Supreme Court refused, with justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch dissenting.

Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — Two South Carolina legislators are calling for an investigation into last month’s execution by firing squad, according to a letter sent to legislative leaders and the governor.
Rep. Neal Collins, a Pickens County Republican, and Rep. Justin Bamberg, a Bamberg County Democrat, are trying to increase awareness of questions raised in a notice attorneys filed last week claiming bullets largely missed inmate Mikal Mahdi’s heart during his April 11 execution. The second execution by firing squad in state history came one month after the first.
SC executes second death row inmate by firing squad

A letter sent Monday by the two representatives, who are also attorneys but unaffiliated with the specific case, called for a “clear, transparent, and accountable protocol” before any future execution by firing squad.
“This request is not rooted in sympathy for Mikal Mahdi, nor is it made to undermine the horrible acts for which he was charged and convicted of and the impacts his crimes had on his victims,” their letter reads.
“This independent investigation is to preserve the integrity of South Carolina’s justice system and public confidence in our state’s administration of executions under the rule of law.”
What, exactly, an investigation might look like would depend on the response the legislators get. That could include involving the state inspector general, the attorney general, the State Law Enforcement Division or a panel of legislators, the representatives said.
“I’m open to how it’s handled, as long as it is done, because I do think it’s important,” Collins, of Easley, told the Daily Gazette.
If none of the letter’s recipients — Gov. Henry McMaster, House Speaker Murrell Smith, Senate President Thomas Alexander and Joel Anderson, the acting corrections director, — spur an investigation, Bamberg said he would consider trying to address the issue through legislation.
McMaster does not see the need for a state investigation, said spokesman Brandon Charochak.
“The governor has high confidence in the leadership of the Department of Corrections,” Charochak said in a statement. “He believes the sentence of death for Mr. Mahdi was properly and lawfully carried out.”
A spokesperson for Smith, R-Sumter, declined to comment. Alexander, R-Walhalla, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Chrysti Shain, spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections, reiterated the department’s position that nothing went wrong during the execution or autopsy.
Bamberg suggested writing into state law an independent review board responsible for investigating every execution and making suggestions for how the next could go better. He and Collins also proposed adding legislators as witnesses to executions.
Trying to remove the firing squad, which Bamberg and Collins voted against adding in 2021, would likely prove too controversial for any real traction, Bamberg told the Daily Gazette.
Instead, Bamberg and Collins would rather focus on ensuring the execution process happens without any issues, Bamberg told the Gazette.
“How can we breed trust and a degree of accountability and transparency for something as final as taking a life?” he said.
Legislators added the rarely used method as an option in 2021 in order to restart the execution process, which had been on hold as state officials struggled to get the drugs needed for lethal injections. That problem was resolved in September of 2023, thanks to another law legislators expanded to protect the source of the drugs.
Two condemned inmates have chosen to die by firing squad since executions resumed last September. Another three opted to die by lethal injection.
Court filing
Bamberg had questions before attorneys for Mahdi submitted an analysis of his autopsy report to the state Supreme Court, but the filing submitted last Thursday solidified his concerns, he said.
According to protocol for South Carolina’s firing squad executions, three volunteer marksmen fire at a target placed over the inmate’s heart from 15 feet away. The gunmen use .308 Winchester bullets, meant to expand and fragment on impact in order to kill the inmate as quickly as possible, prison officials have said previously.
Bullet fragments partially hit Mahdi’s heart, but they didn’t destroy it completely as was the case in Brad Sigmon’s March 7 execution by firing squad, according to a pathologist hired by death row lawyers to analyze the autopsy report. Instead, the bullets struck below Mahdi’s heart, causing more damage to his liver and pancreas than the heart itself, the pathologist wrote.
Members of the media who witnessed the execution reported that Mahdi let out low, loud moans for about a minute after the guns fired.
If Mahdi remained alive and suffering, that could mean the state violated the U.S. Constitution’s ban on cruel and usual punishment, Bamberg and Collins wrote.
“Regardless of the crime committed, the state bears a moral and constitutional obligation to ensure that executions are carried out humanely and in strict adherence to protocol,” their letter reads.
The attorneys’ filing raises questions Bamberg and Collins want answered, they wrote. Among them: Why did Mahdi’s chest show only two bullet holes? Was the target on Mahdi’s chest placed in a spot other than right over his heart? Why was Mahdi’s clothing not analyzed or documented in the autopsy?
Collins said he and Bamberg want to ensure that, in the future, all evidence is preserved so that if valid questions arise — as in Mahdi’s case — “we can settle this.”
Mahdi’s body was cremated at his request, said a spokesperson for his attorneys. That means officials can’t exhume his body and conduct another autopsy.
All three guns fired, and no bullet fragments were found in the death chamber following the execution, Shain said in an email. Two of the three bullets struck in the same spot and followed the same pathway through the body, explaining the two bullet wounds, Shain said.
A medical professional used a stethoscope and a chest X-ray to place the target over Mahdi’s heart. The autopsy was done by the same private firm that has done all execution autopsies for the agency, Shain said.
The department “did not provide any instructions or restrictions on the pathologist regarding photographs or X-rays in the same way SCDC provided no such instructions regarding the autopsies of the previous executions,” Shain said in a statement.
Regardless of what happened, an independent review would be able to give impartial answers, Bamberg said.
“The fact that there are differing explanations is part of the problem, and that’s what we’re trying to address,” he said. “There should not be a question as to what happened, because we’re talking about the government taking a life.”
Until an independent review is conducted, Bamberg and Collins told the Gazette they’re calling for the firing squad to be taken off the table as an option for any upcoming execution. The state Supreme Court is expected to issue a death warrant this Friday.
If execution by firing squad is no longer an option, inmates would have to choose between lethal injection, which attorneys have also questioned, and electric chair, which attorneys have said their clients want to avoid.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-05-13 15:09:50.174261

Ron DeSantis dropped by the Ohio Statehouse Tuesday to lend his support to imposing congressional term limits. The effort would require a constitutional amendment, and Ohio’s resolution calls for a convention of the states to draft it. The approach has never been tried before and presents several unknowns — brushed aside by the Florida governor and Ohio lawmakers.
Ohio’s proposal isn’t even the only convention for which DeSantis is beating the drum. He was in Idaho about six weeks ago calling for a balanced budget amendment.
He doesn’t even go here
Desantis’ visit comes amid a growing feud with Republicans in the Florida legislature. The governor and state legislative leaders both want to cut taxes, but the governor wants to focus on property tax cuts while House Speaker Daniel Perez is eyeing the state sales tax. Florida is one of nine states with no income tax.
Perez criticized DeSantis for hopping on a private plane “paid for taxpayers by the way” when he could be hammering out a budget deal with Florida lawmakers.
“If he were to spend more time here in this Capitol having conversations with myself and other members of the House he’d understand my position — why we are in that position,” Perez said. “And if he’s able to convince us otherwise and have us move in another direction, maybe his direction, he has every opportunity to do so.”
Fear and grievance in the Mahoning Valley

He added the Florida House is ready for “tough conversations” while the governor is not.
“There’s no difference between him and any seventh grader in Miami-Dade County right now who tweets,” Perez said.
The last time DeSantis stopped by Ohio he was campaigning for then-U.S. Senate candidate J.D. Vance while not-so-subtly laying track for his own 2024 presidential campaign. On Tuesday, he insisted his visit “has nothing to do with running for anything.”

Ohio’s convention proposal
Freshman state Rep. Heidi Workman, R-Rootstown, is sponsoring the Ohio House Joint Resolution calling for a constitutional convention.
“Voters are tired of Washington politicians spending decades in office disconnected from the people they’re elected to serve,” Workman said. “They want change, and they’re looking for that change right now.”
DeSantis served three terms in Congress before running for governor, and said that experience left a mark.
“The incentives to do really good policy are just skewed away from that,” he said. “People get up there and basically, they’re told, ‘You got to pay your dues.’”
Workman pointed to polling — notably, conducted by the pro-term limits organization U.S. Term Limits — indicating 78% of Ohioans want to set a ceiling on congressional service.
“This is not a partisan issue — it is a people issue,” Workman argued. “Across Ohio and across the country, the demand for congressional term limits is strong and bipartisan.”
Twelve states that have so far advanced a joint resolution calling for a convention. Every single one of them is controlled by Republicans.
Pitfalls
The problem with hosting a constitutional convention is that there’s little to restrain what the convention’s members decide to do. Article V of the U.S. Constitution is explicit on how you call a convention, but silent on what happens once delegates start debating.
Harsh penalties and gag orders: Lawmakers discuss plans for long-shot constitutional convention

To fill that void, two Ohio Republicans floated potential felony charges and a gag order to keep debates on track, as they considered a different constitutional convention proposal last year.
DeSantis dismissed concerns about a “runway” convention, putting his faith in the ratification process that would follow.
“It is the same no matter if Congress or the state proposes (an amendment),” DeSantis said. “It requires three-quarters of the states of this country, 38 states, to ratify an amendment to the Constitution. I don’t think 38 states are going to ratify the work of a, quote, runaway convention.”
He added there’s nothing stopping Ohio from allowing the governor to recall delegates or place other requirements on their activity.
Still, with DeSantis himself backing convention efforts for term limits and a balanced budget, it’s not hard to imagine a convention exceeding its initial mandate. Asked about those different interests DeSantis argued both ideas could clear the required 34-state threshold before backtracking and suggesting Congress would likely step in to draft it’s own amendment if states got close.
“I do anticipate, in both instances, that you would likely force Congress to act prior to getting the 34 states — I just think practically that will happen,” DeSantis said. “But I’m also not somebody that believes somehow the states aren’t capable of proposing an amendment.”

(Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)As the Maine Legislature approaches its anticipated last month of work, lawmakers are deciding which issues to defer until next year.
Maine has a two-year legislative session, so it is routine for several bills to be carried over into the second regular session to afford lawmakers more time to deliberate, amend proposals and negotiate. 
Carry-over requests from committees are due to the presiding officers on Friday, according to a memo the Legislature’s presiding officers sent committee chairs on April 29, though realistically all deadlines are moving targets until the end of the first regular session. The presiding officers have the final say on what will be carried over.
The total number of bills committees can request to hold should not exceed 5% of their anticipated overall bill load, according to an earlier April 9 memo that advised chairs to begin identifying bills they’d like to be carried over. 
For example, for the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee, that 5% amounted to an estimated six bills as of Monday. That number is higher for the Judiciary Committee, about 11 bills out of the 216 total it had as of Tuesday morning. 
More bills were referred to committees during session on Tuesday and will continue to be throughout the week, so these numbers are not final. 
As committees decide which bills to request to carry over, votes already taken give a sense of some of the issues that will likely not be decided until 2026.
Lawmakers on the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee on Monday decided they need more time to contemplate a proposal, LD 1851, to create parity between the Wabanaki Nations in how much revenue they get from the state’s slot machine income.
While legislators said they agreed with the spirit of the bill, they did not support the means it proposed to do so, which would involve a tax increase for Hollywood Casino in Bangor. 
“I also have really enjoyed the work that we’ve been doing in the past few years, in regards to tribal gaming and trying to create equity there,” said co-chair Laura Supica (D-Bangor). “So, I would ask the committee to consider carrying this over.” 
The committee voted unanimously to do so on Monday with four members absent, though the chairs said they will reevaluate all of its proposed carry over bills as the week goes on to make a holistic plan for its recommendations. 
In the Environment and Natural Resources Committee on Monday, Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) requested the committee carry over one of his bills, LD 754, explaining that it had drafting errors and needed additional work. 
His hope with the bill is to complement other legislation that the committee endorsed this session to address lithium ion battery waste, especially from electronic smoking devices, he said. However, Bennett thinks the work needed on the bill cannot be done in the limited time remaining for committee work.
The Judiciary Committee has voted to carry over one bill so far, LD 1788, which would prohibit an agency or official from charging a fee to cover the actual cost of searching for, retrieving and compiling a noncommercial request of a public record for the first two hours of staff time.
Co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) suggested on May 6 that the bill be carried over and the bill sponsor, Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford), agreed. The committee followed suit with a unanimous vote among those present, with four members absent. 
While both Carney and Henderson noted that substantial work has been put into the bill so far, they said expertise from groups such as the Right to Know Advisory Committee is needed to work through outstanding logistics. 
“I’m still looking at two pages worth of issues to consider,” Henderson said. “There are legitimate questions.” 
The Judiciary Committee will also be sending a letter to the Right to Know Advisory Committee asking them to take up the matter for consideration and to invite Henderson to present on it before the Legislature returns for the second regular session in 2026. 
Committees are racing to wrap up their work as the bulk of the action shifts to the chambers of the House of Representatives and Senate, which are starting to have lengthier sessions with floor votes. 
Debate on the two-year budget is also expected to pick back up soon as the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee has been meeting every day to cast votes on what to include in the plan. 
At the end of March, Democrats pushed through a two-year budget that continued government spending at the same level but also included additional funding to address emergency needs. The majority did so without GOP support after Senate Republicans refused to support an earlier change package for the current fiscal year to address the MaineCare funding deficit, and some other urgent needs, unless it included structural reform to the healthcare program.
That plan did not include any policy changes to address the sizable budget deficit the state faces over the next biennium. Gov. Janet Mills’ proposals to close that gap — tax increases and program cuts — as well as the requests from the public and lawmakers are being considered in this next iteration of the budget plan.

You can read more about the section here.

For the past six years, I’ve had a front row seat to some stunning achievements in Mississippi public education.
I moved from New York City to Jackson in 2019, which was just in time to witness Mississippi trailblazing a new approach to literacy instruction and becoming number one in the nation in fourth-grade reading gains.
With the onset of COVID-19, Mississippi continued to impress by affirming the state’s commitment to public schools as the gold standard in education. At a time when many states began redirecting taxpayer dollars to fund private school choice schemes, Mississippi instead chose to prioritize public education with a $230 million investment in a new, more equitable public school funding formula.
But from my vantage point of conducting education research and occasionally lobbying the state Legislature, there is one particular achievement I think deserves a second look.
In 2022, state lawmakers made an historic investment to combat Mississippi’s critical teacher shortage. The idea was simple: incentivize the recruitment and retention of educators by passing the largest teacher pay raise in state history.
The strategy worked. Going into the 2022-2023 school year, the average teacher salary increased by $5,452 annually, a raise of about 11%. That year, according to federal data, the Mississippi Department of Education issued 4,520 teaching licenses to new educators, a 63% increase over the prior year and higher than any year since at least 2009-2010 (the earliest year for which data is available). This influx of new talent helped reduce the number of statewide teacher vacancies from 3,036 in 2021-2022 to 2,593 in 2022-2023.

Three years later, Mississippi’s critical teacher shortage is resurgent. Vacancies are once again near the peak of 2021-2022 (MDE reported 2,964 vacancies in 2024-2025), and about two-thirds of Mississippi school districts are now classified as “geographical critical shortage areas.” According to data from the Southern Regional Education Board, teacher turnover in Mississippi has spiked and is now well above the regional average. 
As policymakers seek solutions to address the chronic shortage of educators in Mississippi classrooms, they would do well to learn from their own previous success.
There are a number of overlapping factors that influence teachers’ career plans. But researchers and public education advocates have long argued that the educator pipeline isn’t rocket science. Like professionals in any other industry, teachers are rational economic actors who respond to monetary incentives. After years of offering the lowest teacher pay in America, lawmakers reasoned that a significant pay raise in 2022 would make a dent in Mississippi’s critical teacher shortage. They were right.
But while legislators rightfully campaigned on this investment during the 2023 state election cycle, they have since governed with the opposite approach.
One problem is inaction. Lawmakers have not passed a teacher pay raise since 2022. As a result, the buying power of that raise has since been erased by inflation. In that time, neighboring states have also passed significant pay raises of their own. Mississippi may have briefly outpaced the Southeastern average for starting teacher pay in 2022, but first-year teachers in Mississippi can now cross the river into Arkansas and immediately increase their annual salary from $41,500 to $50,000. The average teacher salary in Mississippi is once again the lowest in the nation.
Another problem has been an intentional effort to reduce teacher compensation. Tucked in House Bill 1, the tax overhaul bill that passed the Legislature last month, was a landmark reform to the Public Employees’ Retirement System (known as PERS) that will offer less retirement benefits to future public employees, including teachers. According to an analysis of the changes made to PERS in House Bill 1 by the nonprofit Equable, the newly created “Tier 5” public employees hired after March 1, 2026, who work for at least 20 years, will receive, on average, a 23% reduction in projected retirement benefits (a decrease of roughly $168,382) compared to current employees.
At a time when Mississippi school districts already struggle to recruit and retain educators, whittling away at their compensation package has troubling implications for Mississippi’s critical teacher shortage. Of particular concern is the impact of weaker retirement benefits and stagnant pay on teacher turnover and districts’ ability to retain veterans of the classroom. 
This has become the “leakiest” point in Mississippi’s educator pipeline: teacher turnover has spiked since the pandemic, and schools—particularly in lower-performing districts—are increasingly relying on a revolving door of relatively inexperienced teachers to staff their classrooms.
Teaching is a difficult job with a steep learning curve. Effective teachers don’t just know their subject; they know their students and their community. That takes time. Unsurprisingly, research shows that additional classroom experience translates to increased effectiveness and improved student outcomes. But Mississippi school districts are now losing, on average, nearly 1 in 4 teachers each year (the average district turnover rate was 23.3% in 2022-2023). Cutting retirement benefits under “Tier 5” may soon accelerate this trend. Without the prospect of a guaranteed pension with a cost-of-living adjustment, the next generation of educators have lost a major incentive to spend their career in a Mississippi classroom.
Like many Mississippi teachers, I am also preparing to pursue a professional opportunity elsewhere.. I was recently offered a job in my hometown of Montpelier, Vermont, and I will soon be making a very bittersweet departure from the Magnolia State.
But before I leave, I want to emphasize the most pressing takeaway from six years of education policy research: The number one obstacle preventing Mississippi from becoming a national leader in education is a critical shortage of teachers across the state. It is true that Mississippi has made progress with curricular reforms such as requiring instruction rooted in the science of reading. But policies like this only go so far. Human capital is the most important resource in education, and here the state is failing. With neither competitive pay nor competitive benefits, it’s easy to see why.
To unlock the potential of Mississippi public schools, state leaders need to give teachers a reason to call Mississippi home.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)A version of this story originally appeared in the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
Attorneys general from six states, including Colorado, say they’re demanding accountability from WeChat, a Chinese messaging and payment platform being used by fentanyl traffickers.
The bipartisan group is giving WeChat, what’s become known as a super app, a month to detail what steps it’s taking, if any, to combat its use as a money launderer for the international drug trade.
I have worked tirelessly to address the opioid crisis by using every tool we can to save lives, including cracking down on the distribution of fentanyl,” Phil Weiser, the Democratic attorney general of Colorado, said in a statement. “That’s why I fought for legislation in Colorado, based on a report from our office, to ensure that online platforms have a greater responsibility to police their platforms and cooperate with law enforcement.”
“We need answers; we need them now,” Republican Alan Wilson, South Carolina’s attorney general since 2011, said at a news conference Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Standing beside him was North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat.

A letter dated Monday instructs WeChat to send answers by June 11 to the attorneys general in North Carolina and New Jersey, two states where “knowingly facilitating, or aiding and abetting, money laundering” is a crime.
“WeChat’s contribution to the devastating fentanyl crisis endangers the life and health of our people,” they wrote in the letter, also signed by attorneys general from Mississippi and New Hampshire.
If WeChat fails to respond, lawsuits from the states’ chief prosecutors could follow, as well as advocacy for laws and regulations, Wilson and Jakson said.
WeChat is one of the world’s most popular messaging apps with more than a billion users globally, including a million-plus in the United States. The app created by the company Tencent allows encrypted messaging and payments to be made within it — two features that have made it incredibly popular for criminal activity, according to prosecutors.
The app has been linked to major drug operations.
In October 2023, the Drug Enforcement Agency announced indictments against eight Chinese companies and 12 people in a bust dubbed Operation Chem Capture. They were accused of importing the chemicals used to make fentanyl — called fentanyl precursors — as well as other drugs such as xylazine that are mixed with fentanyl to increase cartels’ profits.
The multi-agency operation seized enough synthetic chemicals to make more than 48 million potentially lethal doses, the agency’s administrator, Anne Milgram, said in a statement submitted to the U.S. House last May.
“Operation Chem Capture once again showed that these synthetic chemicals are cheap — a deadly dose costs mere cents — and sold online on public websites and through encrypted applications like WhatsApp, WeChat, and Wickr,” the statement read.
Jackson illustrated a three-step process for how Chinese brokers and drug cartels use WeChat to partner for fentanyl dealing.
Chinese companies sell the chemical ingredients to the cartels, who make the fentanyl. The drug is then smuggled into the country and sold for cash. In the final step, the cash is given to Chinese brokers who use WeChat to give the money back to the cartel, he said.
“We estimate that we are talking about billions of dollars per year,” Jackson said.
The joint letter, which uses Jackson’s letterhead, is addressed to “whom it may concern” at WeChat’s registered agent in Delaware.
People “are using the internet to evolve how they launder money, to evolve how they evade detection by law enforcement, to evolve how they promote this type of illicit activity,” Wilson said. “So, we have to evolve with them.”
Wilson told reporters the fentanyl epidemic is the top issue that keeps him up at night.
WeChat’s alleged role in crimes
In 2023, Weiser’s office issued a report on social media and the sale of illegal drugs, including fentanyl. The report included several recommendations. For example, it called for new state legislation that would require social media companies to disclose their policies on drug activity and to be more transparent about their enforcement activities, more law enforcement resources, and a new federal agency to oversee social media platforms.
In South Carolina, overdose deaths have soared from 613 in 2013 to 2,296 in 2022, according to the most recent statistics from the state Department of Public Health. That represents a near-quadrupling over that decade.
Fentanyl accounted for more than 70% of those 2022 deaths, or 1,660 overdoses, representing a near-quadrupling over just five years, according to the 2024 report.
“Everybody knows someone, either personally or within one or two degrees of separation, where a family has lost a young person or someone has died as an overdose as a result of the illicit fentanyl trafficking going on in our respective states,” Wilson said.
Last month, three men — two from Sumter and one from Georgia — were indicted in South Carolina in what federal prosecutors called one of the largest international, drug-related money laundering operations the Palmetto State’s ever seen.
They’re accused by the U.S. Department of Justice of laundering more than $30 million in the trafficking of fentanyl and other drugs, as well as taking cash from two Mexican cartels and using it to purchase and ship electronics to Hong Kong, China and the United Arab Emirates to be sold for profit.
WeChat played a crucial role in the alleged criminal dealings, Wilson’s office noted in a news release Monday.
“WeChat has become a digital safe haven for fentanyl traffickers and money launderers, and they know it,” said Wilson.

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)Some of this year’s gubernatorial candidates are draining their reserves as the primary enters its final weeks, though one Democratic candidate has kept much of her money banked as the race winds to a close.
At $4.7 million, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11) maintained the largest war chest 29 days out from the June 10 primary, according to a disclosure filed with the New Jersey Law Enforcement Commission that was released on Monday. Sherrill, the Democratic frontrunner in the limited public polling of the race, reported raising just under $9.2 million through May 9.
Micah Rasmussen, director of Rider University’s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics, noted that 150,000 Democrats have already voted via mail-in ballots as of Tuesday.
“That means voters who are making those decisions have made those decisions largely absent her paid messaging,” Rasmussen said.
As primary for governor’s race nears, candidates share details of their finances

Some of Sherill’s rivals have spent more heavily.
Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, a Democrat, ended the reporting period that closed May 9 with $787,169 in reserves after spending down most of the nearly $9 million he’s raised. The high rate of expenditure means Fulop can spend only about $500,000 in the race’s closing weeks.
“The main question at this point for him is, does he have enough to get across the finish line, and there we have to know more about how much of this spending is for ads that are still yet to come,” Rasmussen said.
Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05) had just over $2 million banked on May 9 out of the roughly $9.1 million Gottheimer has raised so far, his campaign filings show.
On the Republican side, where five men are vying for the party’s nod for governor, former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli ended the reporting period with roughly $2.6 million banked after raising about $9.1 million total.
Former radio host Bill Spadea, Ciattarelli’s chief rival for the GOP nomination, had about $1.9 million banked on May 9, though he’s raised less than $4.2 million throughout the race.
State Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union) had $895,134 in reserves on May 9, of the just under $5 million he’s raised.
“Ciattarelli is dominating organizationally, he’s dominating financially, and he’s dominating in terms of the all-important endorsement from Trump,” Rasmussen said. “He’s not leaving any opportunity for a challenger to get ahead of him.”
In New Jersey, candidates for governor who meet spending and fundraising thresholds can receive up to $5.5 million in public matching dollars for the primary at a rate of 2-to-1 in exchange for agreeing to spend no more than $8.7 million chasing the nomination. Ciattarelli, Fulop, Gottheimer, and Sherrill have received the full match of $5.5 million.
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney, a Democrat, finished the reporting period with about $2.2 million banked. He raised just under $7.6 million through May 9.
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, reported the smallest war chest among candidates who have qualified for public matching funds. He had $666,561 in reserves on May 9 and raised about $5.4 million through that date.
It’s not clear whether Baraka’s arrest by federal immigration authorities last week boosted his fundraising. He received 18 contributions totaling $10,177 on May 9, the date of the arrest and the final day of the reporting period. Baraka reported receiving three times as many contributions on May 9 as on May 8, though that day’s six contributions amounted to $12,460.
Baraka’s campaign used his arrest as the focus of a fundraising plea last week while he was still in federal custody.
Rasmussen said he expects the arrest to boost the Baraka campaign’s finances.
“Late money is better than no money,” he said. “But the problem with late money — the problem with it coming in at the end — is: Can you spend it wisely enough and fast enough?”
Sean Spiller, the only Democratic gubernatorial hopeful who did not qualify for public matching funds, finished the reporting period with a paltry $97,389 banked after raising $431,478 throughout the cycle.
Spiller is relying on Working New Jersey, an independent expenditure committee that told state campaign regulators it intends to spend $35 million on the primary. It’s not clear how much the group has spent. It’s not required to report its spending until May 30.
Former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac and Burlington County contractor Justin Barbera, both Republicans, have not filed any quarterly or 29-day disclosures with the state election commission.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An amended resolution that passed the Oklahoma Senate on Tuesday would reject a proposal to have public schools collect students’ immigration status, but it would require schools to report donations and gifts from non-government sources.
The original resolution would have denied the donation reporting rule, but Sen. Shane Jett, R-Shawnee, proposed an amendment to include the measure in a bundle of approved administrative rules from the Oklahoma State Department of Education. A majority of senators agreed with Jett in a 26-18 vote.
Jett said public schools should have to report donations and gifts they receive that are worth more than $17,000 to ensure parents are aware of any potential influence on their children’s schooling, including from foreign governments. He said donations above $17,000 could no longer be given anonymously.
“If you’re giving more than $17,000 into our classrooms, we need to know who you are,” Jett said.
The rule would require schools to inform the Oklahoma State Department of Education about donations that are worth either $17,000 or the IRS gift tax exemption amount, whichever is lower. In 2025, the limit for the IRS gift tax exemption is $19,000.

The leader of the Senate Administrative Rules Committee, Sen. Micheal Bergstrom, R-Adair, opposed the donation rule, which Jett’s amendment approved. Bergstrom, who crafted the full resolution, said the Education Department’s proposal was poorly written — to the extent it could require reporting of only donations that are worth exactly $17,000 but not more. 
Administrative rules are meant to expand on existing laws, but Bergstrom said this rule falls short of having a clear basis in state statute.
“This rule has so many problems with it, and it doesn’t have legislative authority,” Bergstrom said while debating against Jett’s amendment. “I’m going to ask my colleagues in this chamber to vote no.”
While the Senate resolution now approves the donation reporting rule, it still rejects other proposals that have been controversial.
It would disapprove a rule requiring Oklahoma public schools to ask families for proof of U.S. citizenship or legal residency during enrollment. Districts would have to report to the state the number of students whose families are unable to provide this information.
Jett filed an amendment to approve this rule, as well, but a majority of senators agreed to discard it. Gov. Kevin Stitt has pledged to block the rule from becoming law, contending it needlessly targets children.
The Senate resolution also rejects an Education Department proposal to have public school teachers pass the U.S. Naturalization Test to earn or renew their certification. The measure has drawn bipartisan concerns.
The Senate then approved the full resolution unanimously, sending it to the House.

Ryan Zinke speaks at a press conference announcing the launch of the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus, while Montana Rep. Troy Downing listens. (Courtesy photo)Montana U.S. Rep Ryan Zinke, a Republican, joined with Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NewMexico, to launch a new bipartisan congressional coalition focused on conserving America’s public lands and expanding access to natural resources for all Americans.
At a press conference in Washington D.C. last week, Zinke announced the launch of the Public Lands Caucus, which he will co-chair with Vazquez, comprising 14 members of the U.S. House representing districts across country, but heavily centered in the West.
“Our public lands is not a Republican or a Democrat issue. It’s an American issue, and we should use it in that context of being red, white and blue,” Zinke said during the press conference announcing the caucus’ formation. “It’s important that we talk about better management to preserve and defend why we live in the West and why America’s greatest idea should be preserved and defended.”
Zinke was the former Secretary of the Interior during Donald Trump’s first administration before resigning amid a series of ethics investigations.
The caucus’ goal is to bring lawmakers together to advance “practical, consensus-driven public lands policy that conserves national resources while supporting recreation, local economies and public access,” according to a press release from Zinke’s office.
“Make no mistake, our public lands are this nation’s great equalizer. On the water, on the land or in the back country, we all benefit equally from the foundations laid by great conservation leaders like Aldo Leopold and Teddy Roosevelt,” Vasquez said during the press conference. “Public lands and public access to our forests, rivers, grasslands and deserts are a unique American experience that we must continue to fight for and that we cannot take for granted. They also help support a multi billion dollar industry, an outdoor recreation that powers rural communities, connects Americans to their history and to their heritage, and allows us to pass on our traditions to the next generation.”
In addition to the two founding caucus chairs, the Public Lands Caucus includes representatives from Michigan, Idaho, California, North Carolina, Colorado, Virginia, Washington, Nevada, Arizona and Montana.
Rep. Troy Downing, a freshman congressman representing Montana’s eastern district, told reporters at the press event that “100%” of Montana’s representatives supported the idea. Downing referenced his time serving on the Montana Land Board while he was the State Auditor, a five-member board that managed 5.5 million acres of state land, where he helped manage lands by “sustained yield,” to preserve them for generations.
“In Montana, public lands, public land access, hiking, hunting, fishing are incredibly important to us. You could say it’s in our veins, making sure that we are being stewards of these incredible assets,” Downing said. “But that’s not just Montana. That’s not just the western states. It’s not a partisan issue. I don’t care what side of the aisle you come from, or if you come from neither side of the aisle. You care about this. You understand.”
Many conservation-focused groups expressed their support of the new coalition, including Trout Unlimited, Ducks Unlimited, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and Western Landowners Alliance.
Public lands have become a political flashpoint in recent months as the  Trump administration has promoted the idea that federal lands are part of the nation’s “balance sheet” and could be utilized to help pay off the national debt.
In early April, when the U.S. Senate passed its federal budget, Montana’s two Republican Senators, Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, bucked their party in a vote for an amendment which would have prevented the sale of public lands to lower the federal deficit, though the amendment failed 49-51.
Showing that all of Montana’s congressional delegation shares a similar idea on keeping public lands public, Zinke reintroduced his “Public Lands in Public Hands Act,” earlier this year with Vasquez, a bill which would ban the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Forest service from selling or transferring “most public land,” except in specific circumstances.
And in Helena, a resolution which would have supported a Utah lawsuit against the federal government seeking to transfer federal land to the state, was defeated in the Legislature on a 33-66 vote.
But the issue continues to gain traction.
Late Tuesday night, the day before Zinke announced the launch of the new caucus, House Republicans on the Natural Resource Committee approved an amendment that authorizes the sale of thousands of acres of federal land in Nevada and Utah.
The proposed sales and exchanges are part of a large budget reconciliation bill that will require a vote before the full House.
The lands involved are almost all near the urban areas of Las Vegas, Reno and St. George, Utah, and appear aimed at allowing for affordable housing developments on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land.
The move has drawn opposition from Democrats and conservation groups.
Tracy Stone-Manning, a Montanan who used to lead the BLM under the Biden administration and is now president of the Wilderness Society, told NPR that the move was the start of a bigger push to transfer federal lands.
“Congress is considering selling off our public lands to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy,” Stone-Manning said. “What we’re seeing from this administration is no balance at all.”
During the Public Lands Caucus press conference, reporters asked Zinke about the committee actions, and Zinke responded, according to Politico, by saying he would make it clear to House leadership that he opposed the idea.
“I strongly don’t believe (land sales) should be in the reconciliation bill,” Zinke said, though he did not explicitly say that he would oppose the entire reconciliation package as it stands.

Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, announced his run for state insurance commissioner on May 13, 2025, which was followed up with a fundraising event in Downtown Topeka. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Longtime Republican legislator Dan Hawkins declared Tuesday his intention to run for Kansas insurance commissioner in an announcement laced with pro-Trump sentiments.
Hawkins, an insurance agent from Wichita, followed the announcement with an event in downtown Topeka attended by fellow legislators, government officials and lobbyists, the early supporters of a nearly two-year campaign. He is the first candidate for insurance commissioner to announce he will seek the office in 2026.
“As I considered my next steps and how I can continue to serve my fellow Kansans, it became clear that my decades of experience helping individuals and small businesses navigate the complexities of the insurance industry could be especially beneficial to people across the state,” he said in a statement.
Hawkins, 64, was first elected to the House in 2012, and he has served as House speaker, the chamber’s top leadership position, since 2023. During the most recent legislative session, Hawkins led a supermajority of House Republicans who were set on enacting conservative legislation. They successfully overrode a flurry of vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
Hawkins is a husband, father and grandfather. He is a graduate of Emporia State University and a veteran of the Kansas National Guard, and he has been in the insurance business for three decades, specializing in employee benefits. While in public office, Hawkins has been a staunch opponent of Medicaid expansion, the state-level process that would allow low-income adults to be covered under the public insurance program.
His campaign for insurance commissioner is rooted in conservative Republican values. The first words that appear on his campaign website are: “PRO-LIFE. PRO-GUN. PRO-TRUMP.” He characterized the hallmark of his time as House speaker as leading “the charge to stop Laura Kelly’s radically liberal agenda.”
Hawkins will seek the GOP nomination in the 2026 primary. His current term as a legislator expires at the end of 2026.
The insurance commissioner oversees the Kansas Insurance Department, which regulates insurance companies that operate in the state. Hawkins said creating a “competitive insurance environment” in Kansas would be his objective if elected. He believes deregulation would increase consumers’ options, lower costs and make insurance issues easier to navigate.
“No Kansan should be denied coverage,” he said. “Just like President Trump has made it his mission to make life miserable for foreign cartels, it will be my job as insurance commissioner to do the same for any insurance company that does not follow the law.”
In a statement of substantial interest filed April 22, Hawkins reported that he receives commissions from six insurance companies, ranging from medical to dental to life insurance. He is on the payroll at his own insurance agency, the Hawkins Group, and at Conrade Insurance Group, which is based in Newton.
Mary Jean Eisenhower, granddaughter of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, is Hawkins’ campaign treasurer.
“One only needs to talk with Dan for a few minutes to see his love for our state and its people,” Eisenhower said in a statement. “The insurance industry can be very complex and confusing and it’s important that Kansans have an advocate in the insurance department.”
Hawkins’ announcement is the latest in a trickle of candidacy declarations. Current Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt hasn’t said whether she will seek a third term. She is expected to join a crowded governor’s race.

(Photo from FDLE X account)As the Florida House and Senate resume discussions on a budget agreement, they remain divided over competing sales tax proposals proposed by their respective chambers, which has resulted in a more than $4 billion discrepancy.
According to a group consisting of state Democrats, immigration advocates, and think-tank members who held a Zoom conference call on Tuesday, one place where the state should cut funding involves immigration policies enacted at the beginning of this year, which overall total up to $298 million.
“We’re investing massive resources into fear-based policies at a time when the state’s long-term budget outlook shows growing deficits,” said North Miami-Dade County Democratic Rep. Dotie Joseph. “That’s not fiscal responsibility, that’s political theater with real life consequences, not just for the immigrants who are targeted by racial profiling and a lot of xenophobia, but also the communities they serve and are a part of.”
Joseph referred to the projections by the state Joint Legislative Budget Commission last fall, which said the state’s $2 billion surplus this fiscal year could turn into a potential deficit of more than $2 billion in the 2026-2027 fiscal year and $6.9 billion in the 2027-2028 fiscal year.
One of the immigration bills signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year (SM-4C) urged the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to provide guidance and training opportunities for 287 (g) agreements with local law enforcement agencies regarding immigration enforcement.
Joseph said she wanted to encourage people to reach out to their local law enforcement agencies and state universities to tell them not to sign such agreements. “These 287 (g) agreements bringing in state and local enforcements into this whole equation has done nothing but terrorize our immigrant communities,” she said.
However, that advice may be too late. In a press conference in Tampa on Monday, DeSantis and other state officials said that all 67 county sheriffs in the state have signed 287 (g) agreements.
In addition, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Florida State Guard, the Florida Department of Agricultural Law Enforcement, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission have also signed contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) according to an announcement by DeSantis in February.
Other urgent needs
  Screenshot of Alexis Tsoukalas of the Florida Policy Institute taken from Zoom call on May 13, 2025.
Alexis Tsoukalas, an analyst with the Florida Policy Institute, said that those funds allocated to immigration enforcement this year could be reallocated to instead pay for “3,800 Floridians’ energy bills as we enter into another hot summer. Or childcare for almost 900,000 kids. Or health insurance for 1,100 people.”
She added that the state has failed to address urgent repair needs for the Department of Corrections, noting that approximately 75% of all state prisons lack air conditioning.
In addition to her critique of spending on immigration enforcement, Tsoukalas criticized the competing sales tax proposals offered by House Speaker Daniel Perez and Senate President Ben Albritton.
“While they may be well meaning, these cuts would actually benefit all consumers, including tourists and wealthy residents,” she said, “so they’re inherently inequitable. … It’s accounting 101, right? If expenses exceed earnings, we’re in the red. And, unlike the federal government, Florida is required to pass a balanced budget each year.”
An official with the Florida Highway Patrol on Monday in Tampa recounted an operation that his unit staged last week without any help from federal immigration authorities that resulted in the arrests of 30 undocumented people. Officials also discussed “Operation Tidal Wave,” an operation led by ICE in conjunction with state and local law enforcement agencies last month that resulted in the arrests of more than 1,100 undocumented immigrants.
‘Unhealthy need’
Tessa Petit, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said lawmakers should put more emphasis on affordable housing, property insurance, and natural disaster preparedness, and not “this unhealthy need to harass immigrants” which she said makes  immigrants “unwelcome and reminding us that we are not part of this state and this country.”
“We strongly urge our elected officials to keep in mind what their priorities are,” she said. “They were not hired to turn FHP officers or law enforcement into Public Enemy Number One for a large majority of this community. This sense of funding mass deportation is doing nothing other than pushing people into the shadows.”
However, according to state officials, deportations of the undocumented in Florida are just beginning. Larry Keefe, executive director of the State Board of Immigration Enforcement, said Monday that “we can do more. We have more capacity, more capability.”

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images).Former Missouri governor and U.S. Sen. Kit Bond, who was the youngest person ever elected to the state’s highest office, died Tuesday. He was 86.
Bond was on a Missouri ballot nine times and lost only two races, a bid for Congress in 1968 and his bid for a second consecutive term as governor in 1976. He went on to win a new term as governor in 1980 and four subsequent elections to the Senate starting in 1986.
When he was elected auditor in 1970, Bond was the first Republican to win that office since 1928. When he was elected governor, Bond was the first Republican to win that office since 1940.

In his first term as governor, Bond was seen as a moderate, working to strengthen consumer protection laws and backing the Equal Rights Amendment. The latter position, as well as his support for President Gerald Ford against Ronald Reagan for the 1976 GOP presidential nomination cost him support in his party and was blamed in part for his loss for re-election. 
In his second term, Bond was faced with a major budget shortfall and economic recession. To combat the recession, Bond worked with lawmakers to pass a $600 million bond issue to fund new state facilities and college campus buildings.
The Parents as Teachers program was also launched in Bond’s second term, about the same time his son Sam Bond was born. When he became a senator, Bond sponsored legislation to make it a national program.
“I think that Parents as Teachers is Missouri’s greatest export,” Bond said in an oral history interview in 2014. “We believe that when you advocate Parents as Teachers, you are telling people across the country that Parents as Teachers is Missouri’s greatest export.”
In that same interview, Bond said “the job of governor was one of the most satisfying jobs I’ve ever had.”
Bond was born in Mexico, Missouri, the grandson of the founder of A.P. Green Industries, a fireclay manufacturer and a major employer at the time. 
He attended a boarding school in Massachusetts, Princeton University as an undergraduate and studied law in Virginia, practicing law in Washington, D.C., until he returned home in 1967. His time away became an issue in the 1972 campaign for governor, when opponents alleged he had violated the Constitutional requirement that governors be residents of the state for 12 years prior to their election.
The Missouri Supreme Court ruled Bond was qualified to be governor because he always intended to return to Missouri despite his years away.
“It has been said that residence is largely a matter of intention, to be determined not only from the utterances of the person whose residence is in issue but also from his acts and in the light of all the facts and circumstances of the case,” the ruling in Bond’s case stated.
As a senator, Bond became known for his work on the Senate Intelligence Committee, his commitment to national defense and, as illustrated by buildings like the Christopher S. Bond Life Sciences Center at the University of Missouri, the source of earmarked federal funds for local projects.
In a tribute on the Senate floor in 2010, U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, praised Bond as a fighter and a man of honor.
“There was never a doubt in all of these years of Kit Bond’s service that this was not a man of the very highest integrity,” McCaskill said. “And finally, a work ethic. And gee howdy, Missourians want a work ethic. They want somebody who understands that they are working hard and they want to see you working hard, and that is exactly what Senator Bond has done for these 42 years.”
At a retirement dinner in Bond’s honor in 2010, Thomas Payne, then-dean of the University of Missouri’s College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources, hoisted a large cardboard cutout of an ATM machine with Bond’s face on it in reference to the numerous appropriations Bond helped secure for the school.
“You’re the chief purveyor of porcine products,” Payne said.
In a 2009 article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Bond defended earmarks.
“Trusting local leaders and empowering them to fund critical projects that serve a compelling state or local need is a much better way to help Missouri,” Bond wrote.
Following the news of his death, Gov. Mike Kehoe paid tribute to Bond. In a statement, Kehoe called Bond “a skilled statesman, public servant, and a man who truly loved Missouri. I am blessed to have known Kit and honored to call him a friend and a mentor.”
During the legislative session Tuesday, state Sen. Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican, announced Bond had died and also paid tribute to him.
“The impact of Kit will outlive everyone in this chamber, everyone who serves in the House of Representatives, and his impact will outlive governors,” Hough said. “We don’t have a lot of people like that  anymore. We have a lot of people that want a quick hit and post on social media. It is lucky to have lived in a time that he didn’t have to put up with a lot of that crap.”

Other remembrances of Bond hit similar themes.
Former U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth, who was attorney general during Bond’s first term as governor and worked alongside him in the U.S. Senate from 1987 to 1995, called Bond a role model of a public servant.
“Kit Bond was one of the most consequential people in the history of our state,” Danforth said. “At each level of his career, he knew the responsibilities of the job he was elected to do, and he did that job very well. As a U.S. Senator, he focused on results for Missouri. From highways and bridges to Parents as Teachers, his contributions are tangible.”
U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Republican who now holds the seat Bond held, said he was sad to hear of his death.
“Kit proudly served our state as governor and then in the U.S. Senate for 24 years, with his trademark sense of humor and dedication to making Missouri the best state in our union,” Schmitt said. “He helped to improve the lives of generations of Missourians across the Show Me State.”
State Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Lauhlin, a Republican from Shelbina, said in a statement that Bond never lost touch with his Missouri roots.
“Missouri lost a giant today,” O’Laughlin said. “Kit Bond dedicated his life to serving this state with integrity, humility, and an unshakable commitment to doing what was right. Kit Bond was more than a statesman. He was a pillar of Missouri history and a steady hand during uncertain times. From serving as one of our youngest governors to decades in the U.S. Senate, his life was defined by a deep commitment to public service.”
One of the most difficult political puzzles of Bond’s second term as governor was how to divvy up the $600 million in bonds for state construction. Former state Rep. Chris Kelly, a Columbia Democrat elected in 1982, said Bond finessed that job well.
Bond kept his eye on the goal of the bond issue, which was to generate jobs and economic growth, Kelly said. 
“He got lots of people to work in the state, building infrastructure that we needed very badly,” Kelly said.
Kelly, who was in office from 1983 to 1994 and served again from 2009 to 2015, said the current legislature isn’t living up to that legacy. The decision to kill a capital spending bill with more than $500 million of projects for communities around the state is an example, Kelly said.
“His great achievement was this $600 million bond issue,” Kelly said, “and it’s tragically ironic that the legislature would fail to do what he did so well on the occasion of his passing.”

Henry McMaster bans distributing intimate photos of someone without permission. (Stock photo/Getty Images)For the last year, South Carolina has stood alone as the only state without laws protecting victims of nonconsensual distribution of intimate images, or NDII. That’s finally changing.
HB3058 unanimously passed the state Legislature and became law Monday with Gov. Henry McMaster’s signature, marking a crucial step forward in protecting South Carolinians from image-based sexual abuse and aligning our laws with the rest of the country.
This legislation has been years in the making. Previous bills failed to gain traction. But now, we have a law that not only protects survivors, but it also defends our democracy by addressing a new barrier to public participation: the fear of digital exposure.
Distributing intimate images without consent, sometimes called “revenge porn,” is a growing form of digital-age sexual violence.
Today, millions of people store private moments on phones or in the cloud.
In 2000, just 2.7% of adults reported sending sexually explicit images. By 2023, that number had soared to nearly 77%. This shift reflects the reality of modern relationships — but it also reveals how vulnerable we’ve become in a world where your digital history can be weaponized.
For those seeking to serve their communities — especially young people and women — this vulnerability carries a heavy cost.
In an age where sharing intimate images is common, the fear that a private moment from the past could resurface can be enough to deter someone from running for office or stepping into public life. And it’s not just fear — it’s a rational calculation. Women, in particular, face harsher scrutiny and stigma when private images are leaked or misused.
This isn’t just about individual harm. It’s about who gets to participate in democracy.
If personal privacy can be used to shame people out of the public arena, we risk creating a political culture that only welcomes those with the least to lose. That often means excluding young people, women, people of color, and anyone whose digital history doesn’t fit a narrow standard of respectability.
That’s not democracy. That’s silence.
We’ve seen this before in different forms: gatekeeping disguised as moral judgment.
From criticizing women’s clothing to shaming single mothers or discrediting candidates based on their identities, the underlying message has often been that only certain people are deemed worthy of leadership.
The distribution of intimate images is a modern extension of that same exclusion, now supercharged by technology.
The consequences are especially dire for young leaders. Digital life begins early now. Teens and college students grow up with smartphones and social media. Decisions made in adolescence can follow them forever.
When these decisions are turned into ammunition for harassment, it sends the message that leadership is only for the flawless. That excludes most of us.
This new law helps turn the tide. It establishes penalties based on the harm caused. When intimate images are shared with intent to cause emotional, reputational, or financial harm — or for financial gain — the act is a felony. When there’s no intent to harm, it’s classified as a misdemeanor.
This ensures the punishment fits the offense while sending a clear message: image-based abuse is a serious crime.
More importantly, this bill affirms that no one should be disqualified from public life because of their digital life or a violation of privacy. We must build a society where people are safe not just from violence, but from being silenced or shamed into invisibility.
Protecting privacy is essential to protecting participation.
By passing this bill, South Carolina is standing up for survivors — and for a future where every person can engage in public life without fear.
But the work doesn’t end here. We must ensure the law is implemented effectively, educate the public about it, and continue advocating for policies that reflect the realities of the digital age.
HB3058 is more than a legal win. It’s a democratic one.
South Carolina is saying that dignity, privacy, and the right to serve belong to everyone — not just those whose pasts remain unseen.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cellphone-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-13 15:09:50.174261

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana lawmakers have advanced a new TOPS award for high-performing students, scrapping language from an original proposal that would have dramatically changed the popular scholarship program. 
House Bill 77 by Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston, was amended Tuesday in the House Committee on Appropriations because it would have increased state spending nearly $50 million annually at a time when lawmakers are working under budget constraints. In its current state, Turner said his proposal comes with a $12 million cost that can be covered with unused TOPS awards. 
Originally, Turner’s bill would have created a flat rate for each level of TOPS award rather than a unique allotment for each school. The new rate would have meant students at LSU, its two medical schools and the University of New Orleans would pay more out of pocket, while students at other Louisiana schools would pay less. 
The provisions drew the criticism of Phyllis Taylor, whose late husband Patrick F. Taylor was responsible for the creation of the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, a merit-based scholarship program for Louisiana students who attend in-state schools. 
With the new amendments, Turner’s bill creates the TOPS Excellence award, which is available to any student with a 3.5 grade point average and a score of 31 or higher on the ACT. The scholarship will equal tuition and fees at the public university the student chooses or $12,000, whichever is less. 
The new Excellence award would go to students who enroll in college starting in the upcoming fall semester or later. 
Turner added amendments to his bill that incorporate language from House Bill 70 by Rep. Ken Brass, D-Vacherie. It would expand the number of students eligible for the TOPS Tech award, which covers up to two years of study in a skill or occupational training program. 
The bill will next be debated on the House floor.

Gov. Gavin Newsom will seek to regulate pharmaceutical middlemen that he blames for driving up prescription drug costs in California, eight months after vetoing a similar bill.


Gov. Gavin Newsom announced today that he will seek to regulate prescription drug middlemen that he blames for driving up costs for patients, less than a year after he vetoed similar oversight for the companies called pharmacy benefit managers.
The plan — part of a revised state budget proposal that Newsom will unveil in full on Wednesday — calls for licensing pharmacy benefit managers through California’s Department of Managed Health Care and requiring them to report their operational and financial details.
“Prescription drug prices are out of control and we’re shining a light on hidden costs,” Newsom said in a statement.
California has long sought to more closely monitor pharmacy benefit managers, which serve as intermediaries between insurance companies and pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, controlling the list of drugs covered by health insurance plans, negotiating their prices and processing claims. Critics argue that these companies needlessly raise costs by tacking on fees and withholding manufacturer discounts as profit. They can also restrict access for patients to some higher priced name-brand drugs. 
But legislative efforts to rein them in have repeatedly withered in the face of a powerful industry lobby, which contends that more stringent regulations would drive up health insurance premiums by billions of dollars annually.
Last year, a measure made it all the way to Newsom’s desk that would have required pharmacy benefit managers to get licensed through the state insurance department, disclose the prices they pay and the discounts they negotiate with drug manufacturers, and then pass on 100% of those discounts to insurance plans.
Newsom vetoed it in September, writing in a message that he was not convinced that the bill’s “expansive licensing scheme” would achieve the desired result of bringing down costs.
“We need more granular information to fully understand the cost drivers in the prescription drug market and the role that (pharmacy benefit managers) play in pricing,” the governor said at the time.
Change of heart over regulations?
The governor’s office would not explain why Newsom’s perspective on regulations had shifted in the eight months since, only saying that they “will continue to collaborate with legislative leaders.”
His proposal, according to a summary provided by his office, would also allow the state to review pharmacy benefit managers’ contracts, perform financial audits and issue penalties, and require the companies to report detailed drug pricing data to California’s Department of Health Care Access and Information.

Pressure has been growing on politicians nationally in recent years to take action on drug prices, which are one of the primary drivers of increased medical costs. In just one year, between 2022 and 2023, drug spending in the U.S. increased 13.6%, according to a study on national pharmaceutical trends. Other studies indicate that Americans pay nearly three times as much as people in other countries for the same drugs. 
In California, prescription drug spending has increased 56% since the state first began tracking data in 2017. Spending between 2017 and 2023, the most recent year data is available, jumped by nearly $9 billion, according to a state report on drug costs.
President Donald Trump this week also signed an executive order demanding that manufacturers lower the price of prescription drugs in the next 30 days or face new limits on what the federal government will pay, though it’s unclear how it would work.
Another proposal, Senate Bill 41, reviving many of the provisions in the measure that Newsom vetoed last year is also moving through the Legislature this session and passed its first committee last month.
Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, authored the vetoed measure last year and has continued to push forward bills aiming to bring down drug costs. Wiener said in a statement today that Newsom’s announcement is a “solid step” toward improving prescription drug affordability but that more needs to be done. Wiener, who has been a vocal critic of Newsom’s drug policy, reintroduced the bill from last year, which outlines clear prohibitions for pharmacy benefit managers, including forbidding them from requiring patients to fill prescriptions at specific pharmacies.Newsom’s announcement also included an effort to expand the role of CalRx, a $100-million state effort to procure and manufacture certain highly used drugs like insulin and naloxone, the opioid reversal medication.
Currently, CalRx is tasked with securing lower prices for generic drugs, but the new proposal would allow the state to pursue cost savings on name-brand drugs. This would give California more flexibility to respond to supply chain issues or “politically motivated” federal restrictions placed on drugs like mifepristone, the abortion pill, according to a statement from Newsom’s office. 
In 2023, Newsom ordered state agencies to stockpile 250,000 abortion pills after a federal court ruling in Texas temporarily overturned FDA approval of the drug. That stockpile was depleted in 2024, but the fate of the pill’s usage remains in question as conservative groups continue to pursue legal action to block its use.

States are increasingly setting policy for sheriffs on how much they can cooperate with ICE at local jails. (Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Local sheriffs are on the front lines in deciding whether to participate in the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. But states increasingly are making the choice for them.
More and more, sheriffs’ hands are tied no matter whether they do — or don’t — want to help with deportations, though they often get the blame when conservatives draw up lists of sanctuary cities.
“‘Naughty lists,’ as we call them, are not super helpful here,” said Patrick Royal, a spokesperson for the National Sheriffs’ Association. “We all know there are places like Colorado where you can’t [help with deportations], and places like North Carolina where you have to.”
Cooperation between sheriffs and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lies at the heart of the Trump administration’s immigration detention policy. The administration plans to punish noncooperative jurisdictions with funding cuts — though many legal experts agree that cooperation is voluntary unless state or local laws say otherwise.
Michigan lawmakers hear bills to ban sanctuary cities, cut social welfare services for noncitizens

Sheriffs, who typically run local jails, must decide what to do when faced with immigration detainers — requests from ICE to hold onto incarcerated people up to two extra days so ICE officers can show up and arrest them. ICE issues those detainers when the agency reviews fingerprints sent electronically for background checks as part of the jail booking process.
Otherwise, arrested suspects who post bond or are otherwise released by a judge might go free despite their immigration status, prompting ICE in some cases to pursue them in the community.
In North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden ran on a platform of limiting cooperation with ICE  when he was elected in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, in 2018. But today, McFadden must comply with detainers because of a state law passed last year.
In a now-retracted Facebook post, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in late April accused Mecklenburg and several other North Carolina counties of “shielding criminal illegal immigrants” as sanctuary jurisdictions. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said in the post he was writing federal legislation to prosecute sanctuary jurisdictions.
“You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both,” McFadden said. He added that he’d like more choice about whether to comply with detainers. A federal funding cutoff would endanger important jail programs such as rape counseling, he said.
“Everybody’s focused on immigration like that’s the biggest fire, and nobody wants to address the other things. The losers will be the prisoners who need all these services we provide,” McFadden said.












You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both.

Conservative sheriffs in Democratic-controlled states also can be frustrated by state policy on detainers. Sheriff Lew Evangelidis of Worcester County, Massachusetts, said he’s been criticized for releasing prisoners wanted by ICE but sometimes has no choice: A 2017 state Supreme Court ruling prohibits holding prisoners based on detainers.
“If they [ICE] want this person and consider them a threat to public safety, then I want that person out of my community. I want to keep my community safe,” said Evangelidis. He supported a Republican-sponsored effort in the state legislature to allow 12-hour holds for ICE if a judge determines the prisoner is a threat to public safety, but the amendment was voted down in April.
States act on detainers
Many experts agree that ICE detainers can be legally ignored if states allow sheriffs to do that.
“That detainer request is just that, a request, it’s not a requirement,” said Cassandra Charles, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is opposing Louisiana’s lawsuit to reverse a court-ordered ban on cooperation between Orleans Parish and ICE.
The general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, Eddie Caldwell, agreed that the detainers are voluntary under federal law.
The association supports a state bill now under consideration that would require not only the 48-hour detention but also a notice sent 48 hours before release to let ICE know the clock is running. The proposal has passed the House.
The notification matters, Caldwell said, because there can be criminal proceedings that take weeks or months, so ICE in many cases doesn’t realize the 48-hour window has started.
Tillis’ office said the senator’s disagreement with McFadden, a Democrat, and other sheriffs is about that notification.
“It’s not necessarily that [sheriffs] are breaking the law, but rather making it as difficult as possible for ICE to take prisoners into custody by refusing to do some basic things. Notification is important,” said Daniel Keylin, a senior adviser to Tillis.
States including California, Colorado and Massachusetts ban compliance with the ICE detainers, on the general principle that it’s not enough reason to hold people in jails when they’re otherwise free to go because of bail or an end to their criminal cases. Those three states have made recent moves to defend or fine-tune their rules.
California’s attorney general also has issued guidance to local jurisdictions based on a 2017 state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities. That law withstood a court challenge under the first Trump administration.
Colorado has a law against holding prisoners more than six hours longer than required, and a new bill sent to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week would specify that even those six hours can’t be for the purpose of an immigration detainer.
Iowa, Tennessee and Texas are among the states requiring cooperation with detainers.
And Florida has gone further, requiring sheriffs to actively help ICE write detainers though official agreements in which local agencies sign up to help enforce immigration laws.
Cooperation boosts arrests
Such cooperation makes a big difference, experts say — jails are the easiest place to pick up immigrants for deportation, and when local sheriffs and police help out, there are more arrests.
“A larger share of ICE arrests and deportations are happening in places where local law enforcement is cooperative with ICE,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director for the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program, speaking at a recent webinar.
“A declining share of arrests and deportations are happening from places like California, where there are really strict limitations on local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE,” she added.
ICE is making about 600 immigration arrests daily, twice the rate as during the last year of the Biden administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking at the same event.
Reports on deportations are incomplete, Chishti said, but he estimated the current administration is on track to deport half a million people this year and is trying to get that number higher.
“The Trump administration has not been able to change the laws that are on the books, because only Congress can do that,” Chishti said. “It’s going to take congressional action for the Trump administration to achieve its aim of higher [arrest and deportation] numbers.”
President Donald Trump has added more pressure, last month requesting a list from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of sanctuary cities, which he says would face funding cuts. The administration also has sued some states, including Colorado, Illinois and New York, over their policies.
Asked for comment on the legality of funding cutoffs for sanctuary policies, Bondi’s office referred to a February memo in which she promised to “end funding to state and local jurisdictions that unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.” The memo cites a federal law saying local officials “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” communication about immigration status.
Local jurisdictions in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington joined a February lawsuit led by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California against a Trump administration executive order calling for defunding cities with sanctuary policies, calling the order “illegal and authoritarian.”
In April, a U.S. district court in California issued a preliminary injunction in that case preventing any funding cutoff over sanctuary policies to the cities and counties in the lawsuit. And on Friday, the federal judge, William Orrick, ruled that the injunction applies to any list of sanctuary jurisdictions the administration may target for funding cuts.
Trump’s new executive order seeking the list cannot be used as “an end run” around Orrick’s injunction, the judge wrote, while he decides the legality of detainer policies and other issues.
“The litigation may not proceed with the coercive threat to end all federal funding hanging over the Cities and Counties’ heads like the sword of Damocles,” Orrick wrote.

Unprecedented approval for State Farm after L.A. fires means it can raise premiums in California next month.


State Farm can raise homeowner and other rates starting next month, becoming the first insurance company to win approval to do so on an emergency interim basis in California. 
The state’s largest insurer made the unprecedented request for emergency rate hikes earlier this year, after it said it was in financial distress and expected more than $7 billion in claims because of the Los Angeles County fires in January. 
The state Insurance Department staff recommended approval of the company’s request, but Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara asked the company for more information about its finances. He also asked whether the insurer could turn to its parent company, State Farm Mutual, for help. Lara then conditionally approved but punted the official decision to a judge, who oversaw a three-day public hearing last month to consider the proposed agreement between the department and the insurer. 
“Taken as a whole, it represents a fundamentally fair, adequate, and necessary measure — effectively functioning as a rescue mission to stabilize State Farm’s financial condition while safeguarding policyholders,” wrote Karl-Fredric Seligman, the administrative law judge, in a 38-page decision released today.
The decision means State Farm can raise its rates an average 17% for homeowners, 15% for renters and condominiums and 38% for rental dwellings starting June 1.
The approval comes despite calls for the insurance department to investigate complaints over State Farm’s handling of claims by victims of the LA-area fires. Those survivors and the lawmakers that represent them urged Lara to reject the company’s request to raise its rates, but the commissioner told fire survivors in a Zoom meeting over the weekend that the rate hike and the claims complaints were separate matters.
In his decision, the judge addressed the possibility that this first-of-its-kind approval could pave the way for other insurance companies to request emergency interim rate increases after other major fires. Seligman mentioned that State Farm still will be required to more fully prove its case for the original rate-increase requests it submitted last year, which will be considered in a full rate hearing next month.
“A full rate hearing serves as a critical signal to the marketplace that emergency rate requests of the type State Farm advanced are serious (and) will undergo rigorous scrutiny,” the judge wrote.
State Farm has promised to provide refunds to policyholders if after the full rate hearing the approved rates are lower than the interim rates.
State Farm wrote in its post-hearing brief that approval of its rate request was vital for its financial strength. The insurer said its financial position has led to a couple of credit downgrades and it was trying to avoid any additional downgrades, which could endanger the insurance policies of more than 1 million California homeowners.
Granting State Farm the rate increases was in the best interest of the state’s consumers because it helps keep insurance available, the Insurance Department’s post-hearing brief read. 
Consumer Watchdog, the advocacy group that had objected to the interim rate hikes, wrote in its post-hearing brief that State Farm failed to prove that the increases were actuarially justified.

Ryan Kettler,"New Mexico Foundation for Open Government filed suit against the Los Lunas Schools Board of Ed for not releasing records related to its investigation of former Schools Superintendent Ryan Kettler (photo courtesy Los Lunas Schools)The New Mexico Foundation for Open Government announced on Tuesday a lawsuit against the Los Lunas Schools Board of Education, along with its public records custodian, Brian Baca, for their refusal to release public records related to an investigation of former Superintendent Ryan Kettler.
According to a news release from FOG, after Kettler was placed on administrative leave in July 2024, one year after he was fired, School Board President Michelle Osowski told Valencia County News-Bulletin reporters the district’s lawyers would be investigating him. Subsequently, the newspaper filed Inspection of Public Records Act requests to learn more about that investigation.
According to the suit, those records included:
• Any contract for services with DDSK Group LLC.
• Any scope of work services from DDSK Group LLC.
• Any and all invoices from and payments to DDSK Group LLC.
• Any and all correspondence between DDSK Group LLC and Los Lunas Schools employees to include electronic correspondence and messages on district issued and personal devices.
• Any and all correspondence between DDSK Group LLC and LLS Board of Education members to include electronic correspondence and messages on district issued and personal devices.
In response, the district’s lawyers said they were “unaware of any documents responsive [to the public records requests]” and, moreover, were there an investigation “company hired to conduct an investigation was done through [their] law firm and is protected by attorney-client privilege and not subject to the Inspection of Public Records Act.”
Nonetheless, FOG notes an Oct. 31, 2024 invoice shows Los Lunas Schools’ attorneys billed the district $21,685 to pay DDKS Group LLC, a firm that conducts school personnel investigations. The school board terminated Kettler on Nov. 14, 2024 and never explained its reasons for doing so.
“NMFOG is suing the School District for unlawfully shielding its public records from view,” the news release states. “A public body cannot hide public records behind the attorney-client privilege merely because the school went through its attorney to hire an investigator. The attorney-client privilege covers only confidential communications between an attorney and their client and does not apply to the requested records concerning Kettler.”

In 2022, Iowa Insurance Commissioner Douglas Ommen sought an injunction against the financially struggling Senior Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania, or SHIP, arguing the company intended to “coerce vulnerable Iowans” into paying confiscatory rate increases of 400% or more, even while imposing “draconian” cuts to policyholders’ benefits.

At the time, Ommen said SHIP, which had sold long-term care insurance policies to more than 880 Iowans, was financially insolvent with a $1.3 billion funding shortfall.
The injunction, which was later granted, barred SHIP from offering any rates, riders or policy documents to any Iowa policyholders that had not been previously authorized and approved by the Iowa insurance commissioner.
In January 2025, SHIP informed the Iowa insurance commissioner the company had filed a request with the commonwealth court of Pennsylvania to begin implementing a court-approved “rehabilitation plan” for the company, allowing SHIP to contact Iowa policyholders and to offer, or in some cases force, changes to their policies.
The Iowa commissioner then informed SHIP that even if the Pennsylvania court granted the request and the company followed through, it would be in clear violation of the injunction issued in Iowa. Under that scenario, the commissioner warned, he would authorize the Iowa attorney general to seek sanctions against SHIP.

According to newly filed court papers in the case, SHIP “did not back down” and now intends to “unilaterally modify all Iowa SHIP policies” between May 31 and Oct. 28.
Iowa commissioner cites North Dakota case
According to the Iowa commissioner, there are now 501 SHIP policyholders in Iowa who in April were the target of a mass mailing informing them of potential modifications to their policies.
One of those Iowans is Clarence Busch, who has maintained his policy for over 30 years, and currently relies on it to pay for his assisted living care. Busch reported to the Iowa commissioner that the letter from SHIP was difficult to understand, and that he is now “concerned that I will lose the benefits I am receiving.”
Another Iowa policyholder, 74-year-old retired attorney Janet Huston, says in court filings that she has paid premiums on her long-term care policy continually since purchasing it at age 47.  “Purchasing the SHIP long-term care policy was part of my plan to care for myself in retirement,” Huston says in an affidavit filed with the court. “Now, 27 years later, I am concerned that the benefits for which I have paid premiums since the inception of the policy in 1997 or 1998 will not be available to me when I need them.”
The Iowa commissioner alleges it never authorized SHIP to contact any Iowa policyholders and that the Iowa court has never modified its injunction barring such contact.
SHIP has been litigating a nearly identical case in North Dakota, where a trial court recently awarded summary judgment in favor of the North Dakota Commissioner of Insurance and permanently barred SHIP from modifying the policies of North Dakota consumers without the commissioner’s approval.
After that decision was rendered, SHIP wrote to the judge in the case and claimed the North Dakota insurance commissioner didn’t “recognize the realities facing SHIP” and was unfairly seeking a “result that is simply not possible.” The company said it intended to “discontinue” its participation in the North Dakota court proceedings, adding that it did so “without any lack of respect for this honorable court,” but in recognition of the “hard realities” it faced.
In pursuing a contempt-of-court finding against SHIP, the Iowa commissioner is arguing that SHIP’s conduct is “beyond the pale” and that the company’s response to the North Dakota court’s decision “shows their state of mind.”
SHIP, the Iowa commissioner says, has “no intention of respecting the laws or court orders of any jurisdiction outside of Pennsylvania. Their contact with Iowa policyholders was not a fluke, or an accident, or a one-off violation; it was a deliberate plan months in the making, with the full knowledge that it would violate the temporary injunction.”
The Iowa commissioner not only seeks a finding of contempt, it is also requesting a civil penalty of $500 for each of 503 acts on contempt. The company has yet to file a response to that request.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-13 17:24:12+00:00,CT Mirror,Noem revokes temporary deportation protections for some Afghans in the U.S.,Ariana Figueroa | News From The States,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/13/kristi-noem-afghans-us-protections/,"About 9,000 Afghans living in the United States who had been protected from deportation will no longer be shielded as of mid-July.","WASHINGTON — Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Monday announced about 9,000 Afghans living in the United States who had been protected from deportation will no longer be shielded as of mid-July.
After the United States withdrew from Afghanistan in 2022, the Biden administration designated Temporary Protected Status, along with other legal temporary status pathways, for thousands of Afghans who aided the U.S. against the Taliban terrorist group and fled their home country. Thirteen U.S. military members were killed in the chaotic withdrawal at the Kabul airport.
About 80,000 Afghans came to the U.S. and settled in various programs that offered legal protections and work authorization. Of that group, 9,000 were designated TPS.
TPS is granted to nationals whose home country is deemed too dangerous to return due to violence or disasters.
The TPS designation for Afghanistan will expire on May 20 and deportation protections will lift on July 12. The order is likely to face legal challenges, since Noem’s moves to curtail TPS for other nationals have faced lawsuits.
[RELATED: A family of Afghan refugees arrived in CT. Here’s what happened.]
“This administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent,” Noem said in a statement. “We’ve reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation. Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent(s) them from returning to their home country.”
The termination of the status comes as the Trump administration fast-tracked the classification of refugees for white South Africans who landed in the U.S. Monday at Dulles International Airport in Virginia.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February that noted Afrikaners — an ethnic group in South Africa made up of European descendants, predominantly Dutch — are “victims of unjust racial discrimination” after South Africa’s government passed a land ownership law in an effort to address land dispossession that occurred under apartheid.
The Trump administration suspended all refugee services in late January and has resisted a district court’s order to reinstate the program, along with contracts to organizations that facilitate refugee resettlement services.
Noem said that determination to end TPS for Afghanistan was based on a review from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Afghanistan’s conditions along with input from the State Department.
The Taliban currently control the government and the State Department’s travel advisory for the country is the highest level, a 4, which means it advises against traveling.
DHS added in a statement that Noem “further determined that permitting Afghan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the national interest of the United States.”
Noem has also ended TPS for Venezuelans and Haitians.
The Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court in early May to lift a lower court’s order that reversed Noem’s decision to end TPS for one group of Venezuelans.

,Source New Mexico,2025-05-13 17:11:03+00:00,Source New Mexico,Did county officials enable Ryan Martinez’s violent actions at a 2023 protest in Española?,"Joshua Bowling, Searchlight New Mexico",,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/05/13/protect-and-serve-did-county-officials-enable-ryan-martinezs-violent-actions-at-a-2023-protest-in-espanola/,Survivors are suing the county officials they say enabled the shooting at a 2023 Española protest of a Juan de Oñate statute,"Ryan Martinez, the gunman who severely wounded a Native American man at an Española protest against the proposed installation of a controversial Juan de Oñate statute in 2023, is serving the first year of a four-year prison sentence. Now, survivors of that shooting are suing the county officials who they say turned a blind eye to the circumstances that enabled Martinez’s violent outburst.

Jacob Johns, a 41-year-old Hopi and Akimel O’odham man from Spokane, Washington, who was shot by Martinez during the demonstration, and Malaya Corrine Peixinho, a 23-year-old New Mexican woman who Martinez flashed his gun at, filed lawsuits on Monday against the Rio Arriba County commissioners, the sheriff’s office and the county manager. They allege that their civil rights were violated on Sept. 28, 2023, by county officials and sheriff’s deputies who knew there was a threat of violence that day, yet were seen “leaving the demonstration, disregarding the danger and failing to protect protestors.”

The shooting happened during a peaceful protest over the county’s proposal to install a statue of Oñate, which had been in storage for years, at the county complex in Española. Community backlash was so strong that the county temporarily postponed the installation. On the morning of the canceled event, protestors flocked to the complex to celebrate. They held an Indigenous prayer ceremony and repurposed the concrete slab, fashioning the base for the statue into an altar decorated with handmade artifacts like corn and squash, woven baskets and pottery.

“Respectfully, I am in full support of your decision to put the statue back up, but strongly do not believe it is appropriate or safe to have the statue placed or relocated in front of the County Annex as scheduled,” then-Sheriff Billy Mayfield wrote two days before the scheduled reinstallation. “By choosing to relocate the Don Juan de Oñate statue, you must look at all the possibilities of the unsafe environment it can create.”

Johns saw Martinez, who arrived in a white Tesla and was wearing a red Make America Great Again cap, shouting racial epithets at the Native demonstrators and pacing back and forth. Just before noon, Martinez charged the crowd; Johns hurried to step in front of him and block Martinez’s path to the children and elders at the demonstration. Martinez reached into his waistband, pulled out a gun and promptly shot Johns in the chest with a hollow-point bullet, the lawsuit says.

“There were no sheriff’s deputies present immediately before and when Martinez shot Johns and pointed his gun at Peixinho,” the suit alleges. He bled on the ground outside the county complex for 10 minutes before emergency personnel arrived. After receiving treatment in Española, he was airlifted to the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. According to his lawsuit, he briefly died during this trip.

In the suit, Johns says he saw a council of spirits who asked him to give a full account of the times in his life when he chose to help other people rather than to look out for himself. Even though his shooter is behind bars, he said, he, Peixinho and their attorney see these lawsuits as a way to hold accountable the public officials tasked with keeping Española safe on that September morning.

“I would like to see the police do their job,” Johns told Searchlight New Mexico. “I was lying there, bleeding out in their parking lot for 10 minutes, and it wasn’t even the sheriff’s office that apprehended the shooter — it was tribal police.”

Before the shooting, a warning

Two days before the demonstration, on Sept. 26, 2023, then-Sheriff Billy Merrifield — who died in April of this year — emailed county commissioners to voice his concerns over the planned relocation and installation of the Oñate statue. It had been taken down from its site in remote Alcalde in 2020, when the nation was grappling with whether to tear down, preserve or otherwise alter statues and memorials that represented controversial figures and movements in American history. Oñate is infamous for his role in the 1599 Acoma Massacre, in which Spanish soldiers under his command killed hundreds of Native people. Men 25 and older who survived had their right foot amputated, according to historical accounts, and were sentenced to slavery. In the 1990s, the right foot of Oñate’s statue was cut off by a group that called itself the Friends of Acoma.

Commissioners planned to install the statue — which depicts the conquistador riding on horseback, sword and scabbard at his side — at a new location: the county complex in Española. Such a move, Merrifield warned, could likely end with “deadly force, which can turn into legal liability/tort claims for the county.”

“Respectfully, I am in full support of your decision to put the statue back up, but strongly do not believe it is appropriate or safe to have the statue placed or relocated in front of the County Annex as scheduled,” he wrote. “By choosing to relocate the Don Juan de Oñate statue, you must look at all the possibilities of the unsafe environment it can create.”

Johns’ and Peixinho’s cases hinge on what the county chose to do with that warning. Their suits say that sheriff’s deputies encountered an agitated, cursing Martinez that morning, describing him as “darting back and forth” and “acting in an obviously agitated and extremely anxious manner.” “Due to Martinez’s disruptive, antagonistic and provocative behavior, Deputy (Steve) Binns informed Martinez that he needed to leave the scene,” the lawsuit says. According to the suits, an unnamed undersheriff “then overruled Deputy Binns and told Martinez that he could stay.” Finally, the lawsuit alleges, deputies left the scene.

The absence of any armed law enforcement at this gathering is made worse by two things, they argue: the fact that county officials were warned by the sheriff of the day’s potential violence, and that the Rio Arriba County Sheriff’s Office building is just a couple of dozen paces from where Johns was shot.

“They were deliberately indifferent,” Mariel Nanasi, their lawyer, told Searchlight. Nanasi is a former Chicago civil rights attorney who now leads New Energy Economy, a Santa Fe–based renewable-energy advocacy group.

If either case makes it to trial, the lawsuits have the potential to test the limits of the relatively young New Mexico Civil Rights Act, which was drafted after George Floyd’s murder and signed into law in 2021. The legislation did away with qualified immunity as a defense for government officials in New Mexico.

In the years since it became law, a number of prominent cases have been filed that relied on the act. Alec Baldwin alleged civil rights violations in a January lawsuit against the First Judicial District Attorney, residents of southern New Mexico alleged violations against the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority and a University of New Mexico basketball player alleged violations after a teammate allegedly punched him. None of those cases have gone to trial. Unlike federal civil rights law, the state act has a cap of $2 million in damages.

In the aftermath of the shooting, then-county commission chair Alex Naranjo — whose uncle, former state senator and local political mainstay Emilio Naranjo, played a pivotal role in securing funding for the Oñate statue back in the 1990s — said the statue wouldn’t go up. Within weeks of the shooting, residents of the area sought to initiate a recall against Naranjo. When he challenged it, a judge found that there was probable cause that Naranjo violated the state Open Meetings Act by deciding to relocate and install the Oñate statue outside of the bounds of a public meeting. He has appealed to the New Mexico Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in December and has yet to issue a decision.

None of the county officials named in Johns and Peixinho's lawsuit would comment Tuesday morning.

A long road to recovery

Since the shooting, both Johns and Peixinho have faced difficult recoveries. Johns was hospitalized for more than a month and underwent numerous surgeries. Martinez’s bullet pierced his abdomen, destroyed his spleen, broke his ribs and collapsed his lungs. Johns said it also damaged his pancreas, liver and stomach. Even after he was sent home to Washington, he carried wound drainage tubes — in his pancreas and liver — for six months.

Johns created a visual diary that detailed his medical recovery. The nearly six-minute video captures the raw vulnerability of what it’s like to heal from a gunshot wound. It captures the moment Martinez shot him and graphically shows the months of hospitalization and surgeries that followed. At one point, stray bullet fragments are visibly pushing their way out of his body, through his skin. Following one surgery, Johns is stapled up — only to later learn that his body is allergic to the staples.

“Every laugh, every cough, every movement I could feel the internal tubes touching my internal organs in the most painful, horrible place I could ever imagine being,” he says in the video. After half a year of recovery, he says, he began the long, hard “internal journey toward healing.”

Peixinho knows this journey well. She was just 22 when she saw Johns knocked to the ground and then looked up to see Martinez’s pistol aimed at her head.

For months after, she said, loud noises triggered her. If she was in a drive-thru, she would recline her car seat and lie down to make sure a stray bullet couldn’t find her. If she heard a gunshot outside her house, or a firework, or a car backfiring, the fear came back.

“There were times when I was at work and I’d hear a gunshot,” she recalled. “I’d crawl into the trunk of my car and I’d be stuck there for hours, so mortified.” 

Both Johns and Peixinho said there’s little solace in the knowledge that the gunman was put away. At the last minute before trial, Martinez accepted a plea deal that put him in prison for four years. Prosecutors dropped a hate crime enhancement that they had previously sought.

“Every single time I look down, I have these massive scars and these big holes in me,” Johns said. “But it’s the psychological stuff that’s really been messing with me … I had to agree that my life was only worth four years.”

To both survivors, the outcome was a painful reminder of the violence facing Indigenous people. Just three years before Martinez shot Johns and leveled his gun at Peixinho, a man protesting an Oñate statue in Albuquerque was shot in the back four times by an assailant armed with a .40-caliber handgun.

Both Johns and Peixinho know that there’s no relitigating Martinez’s case. But they see their lawsuits as a step toward accountability.

“When law enforcement fails to do their job, it really puts society in danger,” Johns said. “We really have to have faith that we’re going to be protected when we’re exercising our constitutional rights.

Local sheriffs are on the front lines in deciding whether to participate in the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. But states increasingly are making the choice for them.
More and more, sheriffs’ hands are tied no matter whether they do — or don’t — want to help with deportations, though they often get the blame when conservatives draw up lists of sanctuary cities.
“‘Naughty lists,’ as we call them, are not super helpful here,” said Patrick Royal, a spokesperson for the National Sheriffs’ Association. “We all know there are places like Colorado where you can’t [help with deportations], and places like North Carolina where you have to.”

Cooperation between sheriffs and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lies at the heart of the Trump administration’s immigration detention policy. The administration plans to punish noncooperative jurisdictions with funding cuts — though many legal experts agree that cooperation is voluntary unless state or local laws say otherwise.

Sheriffs, who typically run local jails, must decide what to do when faced with immigration detainers — requests from ICE to hold onto incarcerated people up to two extra days so ICE officers can show up and arrest them. ICE issues those detainers when the agency reviews fingerprints sent electronically for background checks as part of the jail booking process.
Otherwise, arrested suspects who post bond or are otherwise released by a judge might go free despite their immigration status, prompting ICE in some cases to pursue them in the community.
In North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden ran on a platform of limiting cooperation with ICE when he was elected in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, in 2018. But today, McFadden must comply with detainers because of a state law passed last year.
In a now-retracted Facebook post, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in late April accused Mecklenburg and several other North Carolina counties of “shielding criminal illegal immigrants” as sanctuary jurisdictions. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said in the post he was writing federal legislation to prosecute sanctuary jurisdictions.
“You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both,” McFadden said. He added that he’d like more choice about whether to comply with detainers. A federal funding cutoff would endanger important jail programs such as rape counseling, he said.
“Everybody’s focused on immigration like that’s the biggest fire, and nobody wants to address the other things. The losers will be the prisoners who need all these services we provide,” McFadden said.










You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both.

Conservative sheriffs in Democratic-controlled states also can be frustrated by state policy on detainers. Sheriff Lew Evangelidis of Worcester County, Massachusetts, said he’s been criticized for releasing prisoners wanted by ICE but sometimes has no choice: A 2017 state Supreme Court ruling prohibits holding prisoners based on detainers.
“If they [ICE] want this person and consider them a threat to public safety, then I want that person out of my community. I want to keep my community safe,” said Evangelidis. He supported a Republican-sponsored effort in the state legislature to allow 12-hour holds for ICE if a judge determines the prisoner is a threat to public safety, but the amendment was voted down in April.
States act on detainers
Many experts agree that ICE detainers can be legally ignored if states allow sheriffs to do that.
“That detainer request is just that, a request, it’s not a requirement,” said Cassandra Charles, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is opposing Louisiana’s lawsuit to reverse a court-ordered ban on cooperation between Orleans Parish and ICE.
The general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, Eddie Caldwell, agreed that the detainers are voluntary under federal law.
The association supports a state bill now under consideration that would require not only the 48-hour detention but also a notice sent 48 hours before release to let ICE know the clock is running. The proposal has passed the House.
The notification matters, Caldwell said, because there can be criminal proceedings that take weeks or months, so ICE in many cases doesn’t realize the 48-hour window has started.

Tillis’ office said the senator’s disagreement with McFadden, a Democrat, and other sheriffs is about that notification.
“It’s not necessarily that [sheriffs] are breaking the law, but rather making it as difficult as possible for ICE to take prisoners into custody by refusing to do some basic things. Notification is important,” said Daniel Keylin, a senior adviser to Tillis.
States including California, Colorado and Massachusetts ban compliance with the ICE detainers, on the general principle that it’s not enough reason to hold people in jails when they’re otherwise free to go because of bail or an end to their criminal cases. Those three states have made recent moves to defend or fine-tune their rules.
California’s attorney general also has issued guidance to local jurisdictions based on a 2017 state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities. That law withstood a court challenge under the first Trump administration.
Colorado has a law against holding prisoners more than six hours longer than required, and a new bill sent to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week would specify that even those six hours can’t be for the purpose of an immigration detainer.
Iowa, Tennessee and Texas are among the states requiring cooperation with detainers.
And Florida has gone further, requiring sheriffs to actively help ICE write detainers though official agreements in which local agencies sign up to help enforce immigration laws.
Cooperation boosts arrests
Such cooperation makes a big difference, experts say — jails are the easiest place to pick up immigrants for deportation, and when local sheriffs and police help out, there are more arrests.
“A larger share of ICE arrests and deportations are happening in places where local law enforcement is cooperative with ICE,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director for the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program, speaking at a recent webinar.
“A declining share of arrests and deportations are happening from places like California, where there are really strict limitations on local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE,” she added.
ICE is making about 600 immigration arrests daily, twice the rate as during the last year of the Biden administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking at the same event.
Reports on deportations are incomplete, Chishti said, but he estimated the current administration is on track to deport half a million people this year and is trying to get that number higher.
“The Trump administration has not been able to change the laws that are on the books, because only Congress can do that,” Chishti said. “It’s going to take congressional action for the Trump administration to achieve its aim of higher [arrest and deportation] numbers.”

President Donald Trump has added more pressure, last month requesting a list from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of sanctuary cities, which he says would face funding cuts. The administration also has sued some states, including Colorado, Illinois and New York, over their policies.
Asked for comment on the legality of funding cutoffs for sanctuary policies, Bondi’s office referred to a February memo in which she promised to “end funding to state and local jurisdictions that unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.” The memo cites a federal law saying local officials “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” communication about immigration status.
Local jurisdictions in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington joined a February lawsuit led by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California against a Trump administration executive order calling for defunding cities with sanctuary policies, calling the order “illegal and authoritarian.”
In April, a U.S. district court in California issued a preliminary injunction in that case preventing any funding cutoff over sanctuary policies to the cities and counties in the lawsuit. And on Friday, the federal judge, William Orrick, ruled that the injunction applies to any list of sanctuary jurisdictions the administration may target for funding cuts.
Trump’s new executive order seeking the list cannot be used as “an end run” around Orrick’s injunction, the judge wrote, while he decides the legality of detainer policies and other issues.
“The litigation may not proceed with the coercive threat to end all federal funding hanging over the Cities and Counties’ heads like the sword of Damocles,” Orrick wrote.

Walls Jr., former circuit judge, longtime state senator and chairman of the state Democratic Party, died on Saturday, according to city of Greenville and state party officials.
He was 80.
Walls served as a Bolivar County Circuit Court judge from 2011 until his retirement in 2016. He served in the state Senate representing District 12, Bolivar and Washington counties, from 1993 to 2011, and served two terms as chairman of the state Democratic Party.
As a senator, Walls was involved in criminal law and civil justice revision and reform and workers’ rights legislation.
Walls received a degree in biology from Jackson State University and his law degree from the University of Mississippi and began practicing law at the North Mississippi Rural Legal Services in Greenwood. He was promoted to director of litigation for the organization before starting private practice.
In a social media post, Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons said Walls was “a dedicated public servant and a distinguished legal mind.”
“Judge Walls leaves behind a powerful legacy of integrity, wisdom, and dedication to public service,” Simmons said. “Please keep his family, friends, and all those whose lives he touched in your thoughts and prayers.”
The state Democratic Party in a statement said Walls served “with fairness and distinction,” and was “recognized for his fierce advocacy and commitment to the law.” 
“Judge Walls’ life was marked by unwavering commitment to his community and the principles of justice,” the statement said. “His contributions to Mississippi’s legal and political landscape will be remembered for generations.”

The court’s answer will impact more than 70 areas statewide, where both city and county governments have been imposing a 3% tax at dispensaries, according to Missouri Department of Revenue data.
The court case focuses on Florissant-based dispensary Robust Missouri 3 LLC, where customers are paying a total sales tax of 20.988%, which includes a 3% sales tax from both the city of Florissant and St. Louis County.
 The Missouri Department of Revenue broke down the total sales tax rate for adult-use marijuana products in Florissant currently. Another 6% state marijuana tax is added on, for a total of 20.98%. (Source: Missouri Department of Revenue)
Robust argues it’s unconstitutional to have two local governments taxing customers.
“There’s only supposed to be one local government, one boss, one master dictating outcomes and imposing the 3% tax,” said Eric Walter, Robust’s attorney, at the Tuesday hearing. 
St. Louis County and St. Charles County have the authority to pass a 3% tax on unincorporated areas, he said, but not on their entire geographic footprint.
A panel of Missouri appellate judges agreed with Robust in November, ruling that the constitution’s “plain, unambiguous” language means cities and counties cannot stack marijuana sales taxes.
“Only one local government is authorized to impose an additional three percent sales tax,” Judge John Torbitzky of the Missouri Court of Appeals Eastern District wrote in the unanimous opinion.
That decision reversed a lower court’s ruling last year that allowed both Florissant and St. Louis County to both impose a 3% sales tax on marijuana products. 
St. Louis County Circuit Judge Brian May wrote that if Robust’s interpretation of the law were accepted, it would lead to “absurd outcomes,” because “a municipality or city would essentially be given carte blanche to ignore any county ordinance or regulation, including those related to public health and safety wholly unrelated to the taxing issue.” 
May was largely talking about public health regulations — particularly those that apply to marijuana dispensaries — because public health in Florissant is regulated by St. Louis County. 
On Tuesday, Supreme Court Chief Justice Mary Russell asked Walter to respond to May’s ruling that Robust’s interpretation “effectively nullifies” other county ordinances regarding health and welfare.
“This is not a county health code case,” Walter said, an argument the appellate court agreed with. 
However, St. Louis County’s attorney, Laura Robb said, Tuesday that public health is “in the purpose” of the constitutional amendment voters approved in 2022 legalizing recreational marijuana. Florissant relies on St. Louis County to impose public health ordinances on all its businesses, she said, because it doesn’t have its own department of public health.
“So it’s only logical that portions of the revenue should be captured by the institution with the public health duties,” Robb told judges Tuesday. 
Robb agreed with May that it would have an “absurd result to have dispensaries that are essentially not governed by any of the applicable public health ordinances that apply to every other building that’s in Florissant.” 
The constitutional amendment states that “local government” means, “in the case of an incorporated area, a village, town, or city; and, in the case of an unincorporated area, a county.”
At a hearing last year, attorneys for St. Louis and St. Charles counties argued the word “and” is key in the definition.
Supreme Court Judge Kelly Broniec asked Robb to review the section of the constitutional amendment titled “local control.” There, it outlines how residents can vote to ban dispensaries in their towns and cities. 
Broniec read the question the law states should be submitted to voters: “Shall (insert name of local government) ban all non-­medical microbusiness dispensary facilities and comprehensive marijuana dispensary facilities from being located within (insert name of local government and, where applicable, its ’unincorporated areas’) and forgo any additional related local tax revenue?”
Broniec asked if this provision supports the counties’ definition of local government or Robust’s?
“If one of the local governments disallowed it and one allowed it – if it was on the same ballot, let’s say – whose would control, if both the city and the county are a local government,” Broniec asked.
“I don’t know the answer to that question,” Robb said. 
Walter later told Broniec that he loved her question.
“It was very insightful because when you talk about the constitutional authority allowing the local government to outright ban dispensaries, there’s a particular procedure,” Walter said, “and …even dictates what the language needs to be when presented to the voters on the question.”
Walter pointed out that the constitution requires that each one of Missouri’s eight congressional districts have no less than 24 dispensaries. The 2nd Congressional District is comprised almost entirely of St. Louis County, and if the county were able to impose a ban, there’d be a few parts of St. Charles and Jefferson counties remaining to “cram 24 dispensaries into.”
“That would invade the prerogative of all the 90 maybe unique municipalities within the county of St Louis,” Walter said. “And they should be allowed to decide whether or not they want these businesses for their citizens.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5841-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-13 13:17:51.685971

Kathy Steinhoff, a Democrat from Columbia, speaks March 5 in the Missouri House (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).A bill passed by the state legislature Tuesday and on its way to the governor will require school districts to create a policy banning cell phone usage throughout the school day, including during breaks between classes and at lunch.
A majority of U.S. adults support cell phone bans during class time, or 68% as recorded in a Pew Research Center poll. But restricting mobile phone use for the entire school day is less popular, with 36% in support.
State Rep. Kathy Steinhoff, a Democrat from Columbia, filed the cell-phone-ban legislation with restrictions only during instructional time. She wanted to give school boards and charter schools the ability to decide whether or not to place further limitations on cell phones, she told The Independent.
Lawmakers decided to pursue the more restrictive policy, and Steinhoff believes students will see benefits academically and socially.
“The statistics really do hold that if we do the (full day), bell to bell, that’s going to have the biggest turnaround,” she said.
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, roughly 53% of school leaders believe that cell-phone usage has hurt students’ learning abilities. And 72% say it has negatively impacted mental health.
Many school districts have chosen to enact bans, and states around the country have been increasingly writing bans into law with restrictions passed in at least nine states and 10 states testing the policy in a pilot program since 2023.
Missouri’s full-day ban would be one of the more restrictive laws, but there are exceptions.
Students who need a mobile device to accommodate a disability are exempted, and cell phones would be allowed if there is a safety emergency at school.
The legislation also gives school districts and charter schools the ability to decide if teachers may allow students to use cell phones during class.
The bill does not require phones to be locked up. School boards will have to decide whether devices will be stowed in designated areas or allowed in students’ backpacks.
Districts will have to enact a policy during the 2025-2026 school year.
The legislation is part of a sweeping education package negotiated in the final weeks of the legislative session.
It began as a three-page bill prescribing reporting requirements for school safety incidents. Now, at 138 pages, it contains bipartisan legislation, with multiple provisions aimed at school safety.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Steinhoff-03052025-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-05-13 13:17:51.685971

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs was sworn in Tuesday after a six-month wait, bringing to an end a months-long saga that saw tens of thousands of ballots challenged and ultimately counted.
Riggs took the oath of office, administered by her fellow Democrat on the court Justice Anita Earls, before the packed old House chamber of the North Carolina State Capitol. She received a minute-long standing ovation after swearing the oath and gave remarks on the importance of defending the right to vote and choosing justices who will uphold the rule of law.
  Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs speaks at her swearing-in ceremony on May 13 in Raleigh. Though she did not name Griffin in her remarks, condemned his months-long effort to overturn the results of the Supreme Court race. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
“I learned from the people who fought, bled, and died for the right to have a democracy where we all get to be heard,” Riggs said. “The reason I was able to stand resolute, not discouraged and not intimidated, is because I knew that I stood arm-in-arm with you protecting that precious and fundamental right to vote.”
The ceremony came just six days after Republican state Court of Appeals judge Jefferson Griffin conceded the election, concluding a months-long effort to overturn the results of the race in an attempt to turn a 5-2 Republican majority on the state’s highest court to a 6-1 margin. That challenge was halted by a federal district judge appointed by President Donald Trump on May 5, but not before Republican judges on the North Carolina Court of Appeals and Supreme Court ruled in Griffin’s favor.
While she did not refer to Griffin by name, Riggs blasted his long and winding election challenge that sought to dispose of tens of thousands of ballots in an effort to overturn her victory.
“You won this election more than six months ago, but it was fewer than seven days ago that this race finally ended,” Riggs told the crowd of her supporters. “That’s more than 180 days after Election Day, nearly $2 million spent, more than 68,000 voters’ lawful votes put at risk, taxpayers’ time and resources wasted, immeasurable damage done to our democracy.”
She condemned all “efforts to undermine our rights and our democracy” and pledged to protect the rights of all North Carolinians, regardless of whether they voted for her.
“Disappointed politicians should not use courts to try and get a different election outcome,” she added. “It is crucial for you to use your precious right to vote to elect candidates and especially judges who will put the Constitution, the rule of law, and their solemn oath above their own personal political ambitions and ideologies.”
  In remarks ahead of the swearing-in, Justice Anita Earls (left) said she was grateful that voters reelected Riggs or she “couldn’t survive” the next two years on the court. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
Ahead of the swearing in, Earls paid tribute to Riggs’ parents and husband for giving her much-needed support throughout all the tribulations of the election, prompting applause for both her mother and her husband who were in attendance at Tuesday’s ceremony. And she praised the newly sworn-in justice for her intelligence as well as her “passion and heart,” something Earls said was evident even when they first met during the redistricting process in 2009.
“She is a brilliant jurist, she finds the issues I miss — we don’t always agree, but that’s because we have the courage of our convictions, we understand deliberation, we can toss ideas off each other,” Earls said. “I am so grateful to each one of you for bringing her back, because I just couldn’t survive the next two years without her.” Earls’ term is up in 2026, and she is expected to seek reelection.
Among those in attendance at the swearing-in ceremony were Isaac Jenkins and Janice Sanders-Moye of Concerned Citizens for Community Action, a nonprofit that worked to ensure votes for Riggs were counted across the state. Sanders-Moye said she was “so glad” people stood up on Riggs’s behalf and called it a “great honor” to attend the ceremony.
“We worked 14 different counties to help get her elected, and that’s why we were so dissatisfied when they held up the election when they would do the recount because we knew that the vote was accurate. But we held out to the end,” Jenkins said.
Clad in a Riggs campaign sweatshirt she picked up during the election, Leisa Greathouse, a retired curator with the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, said it was a privilege to be an “eyewitness to history” at Tuesday’s ceremony.
“That’s one reason [I came]. Second reason, trying to secure the democracy that I see being chiseled away at, little by little, our Constitution,” Greathouse said. “This beacon of light is a great hope for the whole country, not just for North Carolina.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Riggs_5132025-1024x782.jpg,,,2025-05-13 13:17:51.685971

Murphy federal courthouse is shown in Minneapolis Friday, May 17, 2024. Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer.After the Trump Administration announced the nomination of Daniel Rosen as Minnesota’s next U.S. Attorney, one detail stood out: the state’s very likely, soon-to-be top federal prosecutor has scant experience in the field of criminal law.
Rosen, 59, has spent most of his three-decade-long legal career as a civil litigator, carving out a reputation as a top eminent domain lawyer. He represented the main landowner in what is believed to be the largest eminent domain case in Minnesota history, which paved the way for the development of Target Field.
But when it comes to the bread-and-butter work of the office of the U.S. Attorney — locking people up for federal crimes — Rosen is a novice. Assuming he is confirmed by the Senate, that will differentiate him from his recent predecessors. 
Since 1991, six appointees have served as U.S. Attorney for Minnesota. Of those, just one — Clinton appointee David Lillehaug — arrived in office without at least a short stint as an assistant U.S. attorney on the resume. 
By contrast, Erica MacDonald, who was U.S. Attorney for Minnesota during the first Trump administration, logged eight years as an assistant U.S. attorney and an additional eight years as a state court judge prior to her appointment. 
Likewise, Andrew Luger, who served during both the Obama and Biden administrations, spent six years as an assistant U.S. attorney in New York (and nearly two decades in private practice) before he became Minnesota’s top prosecutor.
“If you’re going by traditional credentials, it’s a very unusual pick,” said David Schultz, a professor of political science and law at Hamline University in St. Paul. “Generally, you’re looking for people with more of a prosecutorial background. I can’t think of any situation where you would need an eminent domain expert in that office.”
Schultz said that he does not know Rosen personally, has little insight into his politics and emphasized that he did not intend to disparage Rosen’s professional reputation.
But Schultz said that it is clear that political loyalty, rather than expertise, has emerged as the prime consideration in the selection of U.S. Attorney nominees during the second Trump administration.
The dynamic was highlighted by the nomination of Ed Martin — who pushed claims Trump won the 2020 election — as the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., the most prestigious of all 93 U.S. Attorney offices. 
Last week, Martin’s nomination withered amid concerns about his full-throated defense of the Jan. 6 rioters and public association with a known Nazi sympathizer. Trump then tapped the Fox News host and conspicuous Trump loyalist Jeanine Pirro to fill the post.
Barry Anderson, a retired associate justice on the Minnesota Supreme Court, served as the chairman of the committee that recommended Rosen’s nomination to the four Republican members of Minnesota’s congressional delegation.
Anderson said he and his colleagues conducted hour-long interviews with three finalists: Rosen, MacDonald, and Ronald Schutz, a partner and trial lawyer at Robins Kaplan, the large Minneapolis law firm. 
“I think we were all impressed. I was impressed by his civil trial experience,” said Anderson.
Asked about Rosen’s dearth of prosecutorial experience, Anderson responded that there was “some discussion about that.”
“I don’t view that as a critical deficiency,” he said. “There is no such thing as the perfect applicant who ticks every single box. It’s the entire package that makes a good candidate. And one of the advantages that a civil practitioner brings to the table is that wide variety of experience.”
In announcing Rosen’s nomination, the Republican members of Minnesota’s congressional delegation were fulsome with their praise. In a statement, the group branded Rosen “one of the sharpest legal minds in the country.”
Reached for comment, Rosen declined to speak on the record but offered a one sentence statement: “I’m honored by the nomination, and I look forward to the confirmation process.”
A Minnesota native, Rosen has been a reliable donor to Republican candidates and causes for over 20 years. His giving has occasionally crossed the aisle. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Rep. Angie Craig are among the past recipients of his giving ($2,800 and $500, respectively).
Rosen graduated from the prestigious Blake School in 1983, where his classmates wrote on his senior page that he was “going to be the first Jewish president.”
He attended college at the University of Wisconsin before going to law school at the University of Minnesota. He also served as an officer in the U.S. Navy during the first Gulf War.
In his legal practice, he worked alongside his lawyer father, then logged five years as a solo practitioner before co-founding the firm Parker Rosen. In 2017, he became the partner in charge of the Minneapolis office of a Miami-biased law firm before returning to solo practice several years ago.
The Senate confirmation form lists him as a Florida resident, but MPR News reported recently that he plans to move back to Minnesota. 
Rosen is a past chairman of the Minnesota Council of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee.
In 2014, he was appointed by Gov. Mark Dayton to the Minnesota Campaign Finance & Public Disclosure Board, where he served for seven years. According to the minutes of a December 2021 meeting, the board voted on a resolution to thank him for his years of hard work as his tenure came to an end. The resolution passed 5 to 1, with the lone nay vote coming from Rosen.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_6205-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-13 12:19:26.161805

Democrats say it’s unconstitutional and blast hastily called committee
North Carolina House Republicans are moving a bill that would curb Gov. Josh Stein’s ability to appoint new district attorneys, calling a last-minute committee hearing Tuesday to advance the legislation.
Under current law, Stein, a Democrat, can fill any district attorney vacancy with the candidate of his choice. House Bill 478 would require Stein to select a candidate from a list of three provided by the political party with which the previous DA was affiliated. That means Stein would be required to select a Republican to replace a Republican, or a Democrat to replace a Democrat.
The bill “adds a safeguard and ensures local voices,” said Rep. Jennifer Balkcom (R-Henderson), and “strengthens transparency and fairness.”
Republicans scheduled the hearing of the election law committee less than an hour before it began, and did not publicly distribute an amended copy of the bill beforehand. Democrats read paper copies of the new version minutes before committee debate began Tuesday morning.
Discussion of the bill comes as similar restrictions to Stein’s appointment powers are being litigated. A Republican-crafted law passed last year limits who the governor can appoint to fill vacancies on both appellate courts and state board of elections. Stein has sued to block both sections; both suits are pending in state courts.
Democrats objected to both the last-minute hearing and the bill itself, which they argued was unconstitutional.
“I think courts should strike this down if we pass it, but we shouldn’t give them that chance,” said Rep. Phil Rubin (D-Wake). “It’s pretty clear cut.”
  Rep. Sarah Stevens (R-Surry)
Rep. Sarah Stevens (R-Surry), the committee chair, remarked that “we do this in the judicial process and it’s never been questioned.”
“It’s currently in court,” Rubin replied.
“Well, this may join it in court,” Stevens said.
The hearing took place while Associate Justice Allison Riggs, a Democrat and the winner of the state Supreme Court race, was formally sworn into office blocks away.
Asked about why the last-minute committee was called, Stevens, who announced last month that she will run for the state Supreme Court seat held by Justice Anita Earls, told NC Newsline, “I was asked to call a committee hearing so we had something to vote on.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1737-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-13 12:19:26.161805

According to an administrative order signed last week by 52nd District Chief Judge Travis Reeds, 52-4 District Judge Kirsten Nielsen Hartig will only hear civil, landlord/tenant and small claims cases starting May 27. All felony cases in the jurisdiction, which covers the cities of Troy and Clawson, will be heard by Judge Maureen M. McGinnis.
Hartig was initially assigned civil actions in a February order from Reeds, although felony cases were not mentioned.
The order is the latest problem for Hartig, who the Detroit Free Press reports has had a troubled tenure on the bench, including battling with Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald over court procedure and allegations of mistreating court staff that Hartig denied, but ultimately resulted in a $100,000 settlement by the county. A former court administrator also alleged in a lawsuit that Hartig was the target of an investigation by the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission.
An email request for comment to Judge Hartig was not returned.
When asked to comment on the administrative order by Michigan Advance, Oakland County’s Public Information Officer Bill Mullan said that it spoke for itself.
“It was issued to ensure fairness in the courtroom. Any future questions should be directed to the Judicial Tenure Commission,” Mullan said.
A request for comment was sent to Lynn Helland, the commission’s executive director, who said there was no information he could provide.

Gabe Vasquez, D-New Mexico, to launch a new bipartisan congressional coalition focused on conserving America’s public lands and expanding access to natural resources for all Americans.
At a press conference in Washington, D.C., last week, Zinke announced the launch of the Public Lands Caucus, which he will co-chair with Vazquez, comprising 14 members of the U.S. House representing districts across country, but are heavily centered in the West. Idaho’s Mike Simpson, a Republican, has joined the caucus and will serve as vice-chairman of the group along with vice chairwoman Debbie Dingell, a Democratic U.S. congresswoman from Michigan.

“Idahoans live in Idaho because we love our public lands. One of my top priorities is preserving access to our public lands and defending our way of life,” Simpson said on the social media platform X. “Being named Vice Chair of the Public Lands Caucus is an honor. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure future generations can enjoy the same benefits that we do today.”
Zinke said protecting public lands is not a partisan issue.
“Our public lands is not a Republican or a Democrat issue. It’s an American issue, and we should use it in that context of being red, white and blue,” Zinke said during the press conference announcing the caucus’ formation. “It’s important that we talk about better management to preserve and defend why we live in the West and why America’s greatest idea should be preserved and defended.”
Zinke was the former secretary of the Interior during Donald Trump’s first administration before resigning amid a series of ethics investigations.
 Federal lawmakers aim to bring ‘consensus-driven’ public lands policy

The caucus’ goal is to bring lawmakers together to advance “practical, consensus-driven public lands policy that conserves national resources while supporting recreation, local economies and public access,” according to a press release from Zinke’s office.
“Make no mistake, our public lands are this nation’s great equalizer. On the water, on the land or in the back country, we all benefit equally from the foundations laid by great conservation leaders like Aldo Leopold and Teddy Roosevelt,” Vasquez said during the press conference. “Public lands and public access to our forests, rivers, grasslands and deserts are a unique American experience that we must continue to fight for and that we cannot take for granted. They also help support a multi billion dollar industry, an outdoor recreation that powers rural communities, connects Americans to their history and to their heritage, and allows us to pass on our traditions to the next generation.”

In addition to the two founding caucus chairs, the Public Lands Caucus includes representatives from Michigan, Idaho, California, North Carolina, Colorado, Virginia, Washington, Nevada, Arizona and Montana.
Rep. Troy Downing, a freshman congressman representing Montana’s eastern district, told reporters at the press event that “100%” of Montana’s representatives supported the idea. Downing referenced his time serving on the Montana Land Board while he was the State Auditor, a five-member board that managed 5.5 million acres of state land, where he helped manage lands by “sustained yield,” to preserve them for generations.
“In Montana, public lands, public land access, hiking, hunting, fishing are incredibly important to us. You could say it’s in our veins, making sure that we are being stewards of these incredible assets,” Downing said. “But that’s not just Montana. That’s not just the western states. It’s not a partisan issue. I don’t care what side of the aisle you come from, or if you come from neither side of the aisle. You care about this. You understand.”
Many conservation-focused groups expressed their support of the new coalition, including Trout Unlimited, Ducks Unlimited, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and Western Landowners Alliance.
 Will the U.S. sell off some of its public lands?

Public lands have become a political flashpoint in recent months as the  Trump administration has promoted the idea that federal lands are part of the nation’s “balance sheet” and could be utilized to help pay off the national debt.
In early April, when the U.S. Senate passed its federal budget, Montana’s two Republican senators, Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, bucked their party in a vote for an amendment which would have prevented the sale of public lands to lower the federal deficit, though the amendment failed 49-51.
Showing that all of Montana’s congressional delegation shares a similar idea on keeping public lands public, Zinke reintroduced his “Public Lands in Public Hands Act,” earlier this year with Vasquez, a bill which would ban the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Forest service from selling or transferring “most public land,” except in specific circumstances. Simpson supported the act by co-sponsoring the legislation.
And in Helena, a resolution which would have supported a Utah lawsuit against the federal government seeking to transfer federal land to the state, was defeated in the Legislature on a 33-66 vote. A number of conservative politicians and Republican-led states filed briefs in support of the lawsuit, including Idaho.
But the issue continues to gain traction.
Late Tuesday night, the day before Zinke announced the launch of the new caucus, House Republicans on the Natural Resource Committee approved an amendment that authorizes the sale of thousands of acres of federal land in Nevada and Utah.
The proposed sales and exchanges are part of a large budget reconciliation bill that will require a vote before the full House.
The lands involved are almost all near the urban areas of Las Vegas, Reno and St. George, Utah, and appear aimed at allowing for affordable housing developments on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land.
 Opponents question why selling public lands should ‘pay for tax cuts to the wealthy’

The move has drawn opposition from Democrats and conservation groups.

Tracy Stone-Manning, a Montanan who used to lead the BLM under the Biden administration and is now president of the Wilderness Society, told NPR that the move was the start of a bigger push to transfer federal lands.
“Congress is considering selling off our public lands to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy,” Stone-Manning said. “What we’re seeing from this administration is no balance at all.”
During the Public Lands Caucus press conference, reporters asked Zinke about the committee actions, and Zinke responded, according to Politico, by saying he would make it clear to House leadership that he opposed the idea.
“I strongly don’t believe (land sales) should be in the reconciliation bill,” Zinke said, though he did not explicitly say that he would oppose the entire reconciliation package as it stands.

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
Federal funding cuts have North Dakota manufacturing support agency working on Plan B

The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.


In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”
In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.
But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Local sheriffs are on the front lines in deciding whether to participate in the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. But states increasingly are making the choice for them.
More and more, sheriffs’ hands are tied no matter whether they do — or don’t — want to help with deportations, though they often get the blame when conservatives draw up lists of sanctuary cities.
“‘Naughty lists,’ as we call them, are not super helpful here,” said Patrick Royal, a spokesperson for the National Sheriffs’ Association. “We all know there are places like Colorado where you can’t [help with deportations], and places like North Carolina where you have to.”
Cooperation between sheriffs and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lies at the heart of the Trump administration’s immigration detention policy. The administration plans to punish noncooperative jurisdictions with funding cuts — though many legal experts agree that cooperation is voluntary unless state or local laws say otherwise.

Sheriffs, who typically run local jails, must decide what to do when faced with immigration detainers — requests from ICE to hold onto incarcerated people up to two extra days so ICE officers can show up and arrest them. ICE issues those detainers when the agency reviews fingerprints sent electronically for background checks as part of the jail booking process.
Otherwise, arrested suspects who post bond or are otherwise released by a judge might go free despite their immigration status, prompting ICE in some cases to pursue them in the community.
  Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden (Photo: Mecklenburg Sheriff’s office)
In North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden ran on a platform of limiting cooperation with ICE when he was elected in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, in 2018. But today, McFadden must comply with detainers because of a state law passed last year.
In a now-retracted Facebook post, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in late April accused Mecklenburg and several other North Carolina counties of “shielding criminal illegal immigrants” as sanctuary jurisdictions. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said in the post he was writing federal legislation to prosecute sanctuary jurisdictions.
“You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both,” McFadden said. He added that he’d like more choice about whether to comply with detainers. A federal funding cutoff would endanger important jail programs such as rape counseling, he said.
“Everybody’s focused on immigration like that’s the biggest fire, and nobody wants to address the other things. The losers will be the prisoners who need all these services we provide,” McFadden said.

Conservative sheriffs in Democratic-controlled states also can be frustrated by state policy on detainers. Sheriff Lew Evangelidis of Worcester County, Massachusetts, said he’s been criticized for releasing prisoners wanted by ICE but sometimes has no choice: A 2017 state Supreme Court ruling prohibits holding prisoners based on detainers.
“If they [ICE] want this person and consider them a threat to public safety, then I want that person out of my community. I want to keep my community safe,” said Evangelidis. He supported a Republican-sponsored effort in the state legislature to allow 12-hour holds for ICE if a judge determines the prisoner is a threat to public safety, but the amendment was voted down in April.
States act on detainers
Many experts agree that ICE detainers can be legally ignored if states allow sheriffs to do that.
“That detainer request is just that, a request, it’s not a requirement,” said Cassandra Charles, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is opposing Louisiana’s lawsuit to reverse a court-ordered ban on cooperation between Orleans Parish and ICE.
The general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, Eddie Caldwell, agreed that the detainers are voluntary under federal law.
The association supports a state bill now under consideration that would require not only the 48-hour detention but also a notice sent 48 hours before release to let ICE know the clock is running. The proposal has passed the House.
The notification matters, Caldwell said, because there can be criminal proceedings that take weeks or months, so ICE in many cases doesn’t realize the 48-hour window has started.

Tillis’ office said the senator’s disagreement with McFadden, a Democrat, and other sheriffs is about that notification.
“It’s not necessarily that [sheriffs] are breaking the law, but rather making it as difficult as possible for ICE to take prisoners into custody by refusing to do some basic things. Notification is important,” said Daniel Keylin, a senior adviser to Tillis.
States including California, Colorado and Massachusetts ban compliance with the ICE detainers, on the general principle that it’s not enough reason to hold people in jails when they’re otherwise free to go because of bail or an end to their criminal cases. Those three states have made recent moves to defend or fine-tune their rules.
California’s attorney general also has issued guidance to local jurisdictions based on a 2017 state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities. That law withstood a court challenge under the first Trump administration.
Colorado has a law against holding prisoners more than six hours longer than required, and a new bill sent to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week would specify that even those six hours can’t be for the purpose of an immigration detainer.
Iowa, Tennessee and Texas are among the states requiring cooperation with detainers.
And Florida has gone further, requiring sheriffs to actively help ICE write detainers though official agreements in which local agencies sign up to help enforce immigration laws.
Cooperation boosts arrests
Such cooperation makes a big difference, experts say — jails are the easiest place to pick up immigrants for deportation, and when local sheriffs and police help out, there are more arrests.
“A larger share of ICE arrests and deportations are happening in places where local law enforcement is cooperative with ICE,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director for the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program, speaking at a recent webinar.
“A declining share of arrests and deportations are happening from places like California, where there are really strict limitations on local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE,” she added.
ICE is making about 600 immigration arrests daily, twice the rate as during the last year of the Biden administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking at the same event.
Reports on deportations are incomplete, Chishti said, but he estimated the current administration is on track to deport half a million people this year and is trying to get that number higher.
“The Trump administration has not been able to change the laws that are on the books, because only Congress can do that,” Chishti said. “It’s going to take congressional action for the Trump administration to achieve its aim of higher [arrest and deportation] numbers.”

President Donald Trump has added more pressure, last month requesting a list from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of sanctuary cities, which he says would face funding cuts. The administration also has sued some states, including Colorado, Illinois and New York, over their policies.
Asked for comment on the legality of funding cutoffs for sanctuary policies, Bondi’s office referred to a February memo in which she promised to “end funding to state and local jurisdictions that unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.” The memo cites a federal law saying local officials “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” communication about immigration status.
Local jurisdictions in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington joined a February lawsuit led by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California against a Trump administration executive order calling for defunding cities with sanctuary policies, calling the order “illegal and authoritarian.”
In April, a U.S. district court in California issued a preliminary injunction in that case preventing any funding cutoff over sanctuary policies to the cities and counties in the lawsuit. And on Friday, the federal judge, William Orrick, ruled that the injunction applies to any list of sanctuary jurisdictions the administration may target for funding cuts.
Trump’s new executive order seeking the list cannot be used as “an end run” around Orrick’s injunction, the judge wrote, while he decides the legality of detainer policies and other issues.
“The litigation may not proceed with the coercive threat to end all federal funding hanging over the Cities and Counties’ heads like the sword of Damocles,” Orrick wrote.

A Wilmington man is facing multiple charges after allegedly assaulting an employee during a disturbance at a North Market Street restaurant last Wednesday morning, according to Delaware State Police.
Troopers responded to Lucy’s Restaurant at 3840 North Market Street around 9:37 a.m. on May 7 after receiving a report of a disorderly customer.
Police say 30-year-old Auston Pratt had entered the pizza shop and began arguing with employees and customers.
When staff asked him to leave, Pratt reportedly refused and threatened to kill one of the employees.
A physical altercation followed, during which Pratt allegedly punched the employee several times and placed his arm around the victim’s neck, restricting the employee’s breathing.
The individuals were separated before police arrived. Pratt was taken into custody without incident.
The employee was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Pratt also received treatment for minor injuries.
After being released from the hospital, Pratt was transported to Troop 1, where he was charged with the following offenses:
* Strangulation (Felony)
* Assault in the Third Degree
* Terroristic Threatening
* Disorderly Conduct

Savit said his role as attorney general would be to “stand between Michiganders and those trying to take their rights away—whether it’s extremist politicians in Washington, corporate polluters contaminating our environment, or shady businesses ripping off workers and consumers.”
As prosecutor, Savit created Michigan’s only Economic Justice Unit, focused on wage theft, price gouging and consumer abuse, as well as new units focused on domestic violence and sexual assault.
He was elected as Washtenaw County prosecutor in 2020 and re-elected in 2024. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Prior to that, he served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O’Connor. He was also senior legal counsel for the city of Detroit, where he oversaw the city’s lawsuits against the opioid industry and led the litigation in a right-to-literacy lawsuit that netted nearly $100 million for the city’s public schools.
Savit said he would use the office to push back on the Trump administration, who he said is “seeking to strip our communities of their fundamental freedoms.”
“The attorney general is uniquely situated to fight back, in court, against federal overreach,” Savit said.
But he said it’s also important to litigate issues closer to home, “whether it’s a slumlord taking advantage of tenants, a business ripping off its workers, or a scammer taking advantage of seniors.”
Savit joins a field that also includes former U.S. Attorney Mark Totten, the Democratic nominee for attorney general in 2014. Only one Republican has entered the race so far, defense attorney Kevin Kijewski, best known for his representation of Clifford Frost, one of the 15 defendants charged by the Michigan Attorney General’s Office with submitting false electoral votes in 2020 for President Donald Trump. 
Savit’s campaign said he has already earned the endorsements of 15 state legislators, including state Sen.

(Photo courtesy of Attorney General Alan Wilson’s Office)Attorneys general from six states, including New Hampshire, say they’re demanding accountability from WeChat, a Chinese messaging and payment platform being used by fentanyl traffickers.
The bipartisan group is giving WeChat, what’s become known as a super app, a month to detail what steps it’s taking, if any, to combat its use as a money launderer for the international drug trade.
Colorado, New Jersey, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina attorneys general also signed the letter.
“We need answers; we need them now,” Republican Alan Wilson, South Carolina’s attorney general since 2011, said at a news conference Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Standing beside him was North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat.
A letter dated Monday instructs WeChat to send answers by June 11 to the attorneys general in North Carolina and New Jersey, two states where “knowingly facilitating, or aiding and abetting, money laundering” is a crime.
“WeChat’s contribution to the devastating fentanyl crisis endangers the life and health of our people,” they wrote in the letter.
If WeChat fails to respond, lawsuits from the states’ chief prosecutors could follow, as well as advocacy for laws and regulations, Wilson and Jackson said.
WeChat is one of the world’s most popular messaging apps with more than a billion users globally, including a million-plus in the United States. The app created by the company Tencent allows encrypted messaging and payments to be made within it — two features that have made it incredibly popular for criminal activity, according to prosecutors.
The app has been linked to major drug operations.
In October 2023, the Drug Enforcement Agency announced indictments against eight Chinese companies and 12 people in a bust dubbed Operation Chem Capture. They were accused of importing the chemicals used to make fentanyl — called fentanyl precursors — as well as other drugs such as xylazine that are mixed with fentanyl to increase cartels’ profits.
The multi-agency operation seized enough synthetic chemicals to make more than 48 million potentially lethal doses, the agency’s administrator, Anne Milgram, said in a statement submitted to the U.S. House last May.
“Operation Chem Capture once again showed that these synthetic chemicals are cheap — a deadly dose costs mere cents — and sold online on public websites and through encrypted applications like WhatsApp, WeChat, and Wickr,” the statement read.
Jackson illustrated a three-step process for how Chinese brokers and drug cartels use WeChat to partner for fentanyl dealing.
Chinese companies sell the chemical ingredients to the cartels, who make the fentanyl. The drug is then smuggled into the country and sold for cash. In the final step, the cash is given to Chinese brokers who use WeChat to give the money back to the cartel, he said.
“We estimate that we are talking about billions of dollars per year,” Jackson said.
The joint letter, which uses Jackson’s letterhead, is addressed to “whom it may concern” at WeChat’s registered agent in Delaware.
People “are using the internet to evolve how they launder money, to evolve how they evade detection by law enforcement, to evolve how they promote this type of illicit activity,” Wilson said. “So, we have to evolve with them.”
Wilson told reporters the fentanyl epidemic is the top issue that keeps him up at night.
“WeChat has become a digital safe haven for fentanyl traffickers and money launderers, and they know it,” said Wilson.

A scoop of ice cream and a second chance — that’s what visitors will find when The Scoop on Loockerman reopens for the season this week in Downtown Dover.
Located at 305 W. Loockerman Street, the youth-run ice cream shop is more than just a stop for summer snacks.
It’s a social enterprise powered by NeighborGood Partners through its Restoring Central Dover initiative.
The program provides job opportunities, mentorship, and critical life skills to local youth, particularly those who are justice-involved or considered at-risk.

“This isn’t just about ice cream,” said Rona Harris, community development coordinator of Restoring Central Dover. “It’s about giving young people a second chance and helping them build the skills and confidence they need to succeed in life.”
The Scoop draws inspiration from Café Momentum in Dallas, Texas — a nationally acclaimed restaurant and training ground for justice-involved youth.
Similarly, the Dover shop offers young employees experience in customer service, teamwork, money management, and more, all while connecting them and their families with wraparound support services.
Launched last year with startup funding from SoDel Concepts, which provided a $10,000 grant for equipment, The Scoop quickly became a symbol of hope and transformation in the community.
The grand reopening on May 15 from 3 to 6 p.m. will include free ice cream, hot dogs, music, and a chance to meet the youth behind the counter.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)Olga Grays has cared for hundreds of children since she became certified in 2025 as a home daycare provider in Las Cruces, but her experiences have not been without difficulty.
Grays owns and operates Mrs. Olga’s Daycare near the west side of the city where she cares for 15 children throughout the day. She described the business to Source NM as a “family” with her adult children working with her, as well as long-time employees.
Grays joined the national “Day Without Child Care” movement on Monday, where early childhood centers closed their doors for a full day to bring awareness to the necessity of childcare and the low wages teachers are paid to care for children. Albuquerque-based advocacy organization OLÉ New Mexico hosted three events in the state, including at Grays’ home.
Organizers, educators and parents spoke in Las Cruces about the need for a guaranteed $18 per hour base wage for early childhood educators; expanding the industry to recognize experience as well as education teachers have; and ensuring child care is accessible and affordable in the state. 
Maria Ruiz, a long-time employee of Grays, explained that she entered the early childhood education workforce soon after moving to the U.S. from Mexico and has at least 20 years of experience working with children. However, because she does not have a degree, she is stuck only making minimum wage.
“All my kids were so little and I saw them grow here,” Ruiz said in Spanish as an interpreter translated. She became a widow several years later and left the daycare to make more money to sustain her family, but returned to Olga’s where she enjoyed better working conditions. She said her years of experience should qualify her for higher wages. “We can’t afford this kind of life. Everything is so expensive.”
Marc Cordova, a single parent with two young children enrolled at Olga’s Daycare, emphasized the flexibility a smaller daycare provides him so he can get to work early and ensure his children are cared for. 

Marc Cordova is pictured with his youngest children, Evalynn Codova, 5, and Marc Cordova Jr., 3, at Mrs. Olga’s Daycare in Las Cruces on May 12, 2025. (Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)    
“Mrs. Olga and her employees have always gone that extra mile for our children. Mrs. Olga has even offered to get my Evalynn ready for school and drop her off, knowing my situation of being a single father. I don’t know any other daycare programs willing to help like that,” Cordova said.
Grays explained to Source that not only has she looked after and taught children during the day, but she’s also done emergency foster care for children who, for example, do not get picked up or who need a safe place to stay while their guardians deal with other factors. She said she took in one four-month-old boy until he was 8 years old. 
“It’s my passion. I feel like kids that are the most in need, who lack the resources because either both parents are addicted or they don’t have that support, that those are the kids who [don’t get] seen. I understand there’s parents who could afford expensive daycares with better quality,” Grays said. “I chose to get a pay cut and stay in this because I feel like that’s who needs it the most. And who sees them? Nobody really. And so I make sure that I tell my employees, my kids, they have the same heart as me.”

“He will be held legally accountable. He has to be,” said Malik Shabazz, a lawyer for the two men, Eddie Parker and Michael Jenkins. “Some of what [Gaines] said is obviously defamatory.”

Two days after the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department announced it was paying Parker and Jenkins $2.5 million, Gaines told the 100 people gathered at the sheriff’s breakfast that the department’s lawyer, Jason Dare, “beat the pants off of those guys — the dopers, the people that raped and doped your daughters. He beat their pants off.”
Neither of the two men have been convicted of felony drug or rape charges in Rankin County or neighboring Hinds County, according to court records. In 2019, Parker was convicted in Alabama of drug possession with intent to sell.
In 2023, six Rankin County law enforcement officers, some of whom called themselves the “Goon Squad,” tortured the two men with Tasers, used a sex toy on them and shot one of them in the mouth. Deputies planted a BB gun and drugs on the men to try and cover up their crimes, but they were caught. They are now serving between 10 and 40 years in federal prison.

On Friday, Angela English, president of the Rankin County NAACP, asked Gaines to step down: “There is no way you can effectively do your job with the kind of racial hatred you have in your heart.”
Gaines did not respond to a request for comment.
Behind the scenes, some local power brokers are urging Gaines to resign. “It’s devastating to us trying to rebuild trust in the community, which was already destroyed,” said one elected official, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution. “It’s infuriating, because we’re the ones having to pick up the pieces.”
Pressure on the sheriff’s department has been mounting since the torture allegations emerged. The local chapter of the NAACP has repeatedly called on Sheriff Bryan Bailey to step down. 
But at the May 3 breakfast gathering, Gaines and other county officials threw their support behind the sheriff. “Bryan’s got his legs back under him,” he said. “You can’t go through what he’s went through with all the fake news and false information and stay together like Bryan has.”
Bailey thanked Gaines and said, “My board of supervisors stood behind me  110%.”
The sheriff said he thought about stepping down over the past 28 months. “I was ready to quit, give up,” he said, but his mentor and former father-in-law, Irl Dean Rhodes, urged him to stay, saying, “You don’t quit. You’re going to run again.”
In 2023, Bailey faced no opposition, but that won’t be the case in 2027.

Retired Sgt. Ronnie Moore, 58, said he plans to run for sheriff because “everybody wants a change.” In the 72% white county, he served among the small number of Black deputies for three decades before retiring last year from the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department.
“You have to love everybody. You’ve got to have a heart for people,” he said. “It ain’t all about wearing a badge and carrying a gun. It ain’t all about Black and white, but about what’s right and wrong.”
He doesn’t believe in “throwing dirt,” he said, “but if you do wrong, karma will come back and get you.”
Moore said of Gaines’ remarks, “Instead of putting out the fire, they’re pouring gas on it. God sees them people.”
Bailey has insisted he knew nothing about what deputies did to Parker and Jenkins and denied these former deputies’ accusations that there was a culture of violence in the department. He said if he had known, he would have stopped it.
After recently announcing his candidacy at the Briar Hill Baptist Church and the Exchange Club of Richland, Scott Womack, 57, has spent his days attending civic events, shaking hands and asking for votes.
He worked for 27 years as a special agent at the state auditor’s office, serving as lead agent on the investigation into the Mississippi Beef Plant, a $55 million, taxpayer-funded debacle, which ended in prison sentences for some. He also served as a chief deputy for Simpson County.

“Our team’s campaign will focus on restoring the trust, integrity, pride and confidence in the position of sheriff in Rankin County,” he said.
There must be a focus on restoring trust with Rankin County employees and citizens through safety and excellent service, he said. In addition, “we will explore ways to work with county leadership to minimize civil litigation, and I will utilize my relationships with local, state and federal agencies to help restore confidence,” he said.
Another lawsuit alleging abuse is pending in federal court against the department, and plaintiffs’ lawyers have discussed bringing other possible cases.
An investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times exposed a decades-long reign of terror by nearly two dozen Rankin County deputies, but the six officers are the only ones who have been charged.
Another story by Mississippi Today and the Times revealed that the sheriff spent more than $150,000 in taxpayer money on equipment and supplies that were allegedly used at his mother’s commercial chicken farm. State Auditor Shad White is now investigating these allegations.
Jessica Pishko, a lawyer and national expert on sheriffs, said it’s rare for sheriffs to get removed by petition, but Mississippi’s statute makes it tougher than most other states.
Under state law, the governor is the only one with the power to remove the sheriff and can only act if he or she receives a petition demanding the sheriff’s removal signed by at least 30% of the qualified voters.
English said NAACP officials gathered thousands of signatures for a petition to remove Bailey but stopped last Thanksgiving when they ran into roadblocks under Mississippi law that requires them to gather all the signatures within 180 days. In addition to that, any signatures collected more than 60 days before the petition is filed are considered invalid.
Rankin County has more than 102,000 registered voters, which means any such petition would require more than 30,000 signatures. In contrast, 10% of voters can sign a petition to trigger a recall election of a sheriff in California counties with more than 100,000 registered voters.
In Mississippi, there is no requirement in the law for sheriffs to be certified law enforcement officers, but they can’t be atheists. 
In many states, sheriffs have to violate their oath to get removed from office, said Pishko, author of “The Highest Law in the Land: How the Unchecked Power of Sheriffs Threatens Democracy.” 
That oath requires sheriffs to uphold the federal and state constitutions as well as obeying the laws. “Unfortunately,” Pishko said, “there are a lot of bad things that sheriffs can do that don’t violate their oath.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/06031713/Goon-Squad-sentencing-12.jpg,,,2025-05-13 11:04:19.908807

(Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa senators voted 27-22 late Monday to pass a bill to limit the ability of carbon sequestration pipelines to use eminent domain, sending it to the governor’s desk after a drawn-out debate.
The decision follows four years of Iowans and House lawmakers urging for eminent domain reform in response to the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.
House File 639 comprised a number of bills passed by the House aimed at eminent domain. Senators tried repeatedly to change the scope of the bill with various amendments, none of which were adopted.
Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink, R- Fort Dodge, said amid debates on eminent domain and carbon capture pipelines, that senators were “missing the point” that the bill was poorly written and likely to create problems.
“The point is a crappy bill that we’re going to be voting on here in a little bit,” Kraayenbrink said.
Four years coming 
Landowners opposed to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline have traveled to the Capitol countless times over the past four years, urging lawmakers to move on the issue.
Many of those opposed to the pipeline own land in its path and fear its impact to their land, property values and safety.
South Dakota regulators deny carbon pipeline permit again, but company vows to reapply

The pipeline would transport carbon dioxide, captured from ethanol facilities, across Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, the Dakotas and into underground storage in North Dakota. The Iowa Utilities Commission granted the project eminent domain rights in June, though the project cannot begin construction until it has permits in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota.
Proponents of the pipeline say it will allow Iowa to enter new, low-carbon ethanol markets, which would in turn help corn and soybean farmers.
The company’s permit in South Dakota was recently denied, following the state’s passage of a law preventing hazardous liquid pipelines carrying carbon dioxide from using eminent domain in the state. Summit has said it plans to reapply.
HF 639, as written, changed definitions of a common carrier, increased insurance requirements to cover any damages to property and reimburse landowners for increases in premiums due to the pipeline, set requirements for the IUC and expanded who can intervene in IUC proceedings.
A group of 12 senators signed a letter last week saying they would not vote on budget legislation until the eminent domain bill was debated. Their move stalled action on budget bills and contributed to pushing the session into overtime.  Lawmakers have not received part of their per diem expense payments since May 2.
After the pipeline bill passed, senators approved the budgets for education and agriculture and natural resources, sending them to the House.
Senators planned to debate the issue on Friday, and drew a crowd of interested constituents to the Capitol, but the chambers leaders did not bring the bill to the floor.
Bousselot’s amendment fails
Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, the bill’s floor manager, proposed an amendment that would rewrite the bill, similar to what he had proposed in committee, that would have allowed companies to pursue voluntary easements outside of the project corridor, in order to avoid using eminent domain.
Bousselot called the original bill a “Trojan horse” bill written by “climate extremists” trying to kill the Summit pipeline project.
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, who sponsored HF 639, said it’s “ridiculous” to suggest the bill is about environmental extremists.
South Dakota governor signs eminent domain ban on carbon pipelines

“This is not about environmental extremism at all, it’s about protecting landowners,” Holt said. “I think that the arrogance the Senate is showing, the disrespect to property owners is frankly unacceptable.”
Bousselot’s amendment would have kept HF 639 provisions requiring Iowa Utilities Commission members’ attendance at permit hearings, created a one-year deadline for permit decisions, and would have held project operators responsible for damage to the land during the lifetime of the project.
Under the amendment, the eminent domain changes would have applied to all projects seeking government permission to force unwilling landowners to give up easements for a court-determined price, not just carbon sequestration projects.
Bousselot said the amendment “protects Iowans, protects landowners of all types, for all project types.”
His amendment would have stopped carbon sequestration pipelines from using eminent domain, unless the project had been granted a permit by the IUC before the enactment date, or had a sole purpose of connecting to another project that was already granted eminent domain.
“It ends eminent domain on CO2 pipelines in a constitutional manner, on a go forward basis,” Bousselot said.
Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, said it’s “not correct” to say the bill is all about killing the Summit project.
“We’re just saying you have to follow the law,” Taylor said.
Taylor said the requirement to use eminent domain is public use.
“It’s not a positive business climate, it’s not helping the agribusinesses in the state, it’s not the price of corn or helping the ethanol plants, it’s public use,” Taylor said.
Bousselot’s amendment failed narrowly, 28-22.
Democrats push for simplified, eminent domain only amendment
Democrats submitted an amendment, with language from House File 943, which the House passed in March, to ban the use of eminent domain on pipelines transporting liquified carbon dioxide.
Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, sponsored the amendment and said it would get at the “fundamental question” of eminent domain, which constituents have asked the body to debate.
Wahls said bipartisan conversations over the past several weeks have been “fractured” and “raucous.”
“I think most of the people in this room are quite tired, but I’m quite positive that there is nobody in this room more tired than the landowners who are sitting in the gallery because they’ve been taking time out of their lives, not being paid to come to this building, and ask for their voice to be heard,” Wahls said.
Bousselot argued that the amendment was not germane, since it was a “major change to the scope of the bill” and Senate President Amy Sinclair, R-Allerton, agreed and the amendment was scrapped.
On the ‘crappy’ bill
Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, asked Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, about some of the issues he had with the bill, including multiple definitions of a common carrier and an “elevated standard” for judicial review that he said would “bog the system down.”
Klimesh also noted a lack of specificity in some of the language of the bill, like the section expanding intervenors in utility board cases that does not specify that members of the general assembly, city or county officials must be in Iowa.
“I mean is that the intention really, to bog this system down with interveners from any place or anywhere, any elected official, any city council, county official, or any resident with plausible interest in the proceedings?” Klimesh said.
Following the decision, Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, said the arguments brought up on the Senate floor about the bill providing for out-of-state individuals to intervene with the Iowa permitting process were incorrect, and “it reflects a misunderstanding of the IUC system and administrative law.”
He said the process of intervention only gives individuals the right to file motions and get copies of meetings by email.
“It’s not an invitation to sue,” Thomson said. “And there is a limitation on there, that you have to have some connection with what’s going on. It’s absurd to say that we’re opening the process up to endless litigation.”
Klimesh asked on the floor how the insurance clauses of the bill would be determined.
He said the bill, as written, would make it more difficult for all pipeline projects in the future, tie up “critical infrastructure projects” in court and pass costs onto consumers who would have increased utility costs.

Klimesh said in the future, companies that want to build pipelines in the state would be deterred by the requirements in the bill that would be costly.
Alons said much of the language was a “codification” of what is already in the IUC rules.
Klimesh said the bill would lead to increasing costs on energy for Iowans.
“Cost drivers, cost increases — they’re based off decisions we make here in this chamber,” Klimesh said. “This is one of those decisions that is going to affect pipeline companies, again, far beyond CO2 pipeline companies, and places an onerous burden on them to ascertain and achieve this coverage.”
Klimesh also worried that enactment language in the bill would open the door to lawsuits from Iowans who have already signed an easement contract with the state when Summit is no longer able to uphold that contract without eminent domain to complete the project.
“I’m concerned about putting the state of Iowa and our taxpayers at a legal risk,” Klimesh said.
“This bill sets up a whole avalanche of potential bad policy. While we were trying to squash a fly, we took a nuclear bomb to it.”
Taylor said senators tried to swap HF 639 for a different version, via the Democrats’ amendment, but “it was rejected out of hand.”
“So it makes me wonder if it wasn’t really just any opposition to tampering with the Summit pipeline, rather than the particulars of 639,” Taylor said.
Taylor said the group of GOP senators who stepped forward to push for a debate on this faced criticism for it, but Taylor said he was standing for Republican values and the motto of Iowa. 
“When it says our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain, there’s not an asterisk there,” he said. “It doesn’t say unless we’re threatened by a billion dollar lawsuit.”
Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, said he was “flummoxed” that the Democrat’s amendment was turned down, because it made the argument “really simple.”
“You can be for the pipeline, you can be for ethanol production, you can be for union workers putting that pipeline together, and say, ‘we can do this without having to use eminent domain,’” Zimmer said.
Klimesh said when he met with the 12 senators who pushed for a debate on the bill, he offered to work with them and to amend the bill to resemble HF 943, but the group declined.
“In that week’s time, we could have sat around and crafted probably a much better piece of legislation,” Klimesh said.
Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said “hogwash” and that there was an opportunity for a cleaner bill on the floor and the majority chose to ignore it.
Sen. Tony Bisignano, D-Des Moines, criticized the majority party for not working on the bill sooner.
“Where have you been? This bill didn’t start a week ago … we’ve had years,” Bisignano said.
Sen. Dan Zumbach, R-Ryan, said “emotions got ahead of reality” on the issue and as a result, the body is stuck with “horrible” legislation.
“This bill is about killing a project, not about constitutionality, not about property rights — we missed that boat, folks,” Zumbach said. “Had it laid out there in front of us and we were too stubborn to listen to the actual words.”
Bousselot said in his closing comments on the bill that everyone will leave the Capitol Monday claiming they “voted to protect private property rights” because everyone either voted for his amendment, or for the bill.
“I hope we have a plan for infrastructure, to grow our state, for the jobs that are going to be harder to build, for the farmers that produce the wealth and the great crops and commodities that we rely on,” Bousselot said.
The bill advanced from the Senate and will now go to Gov. Kim Reynolds for final approval. Reynolds has not said publicly whether she would sign or veto it. Summit Carbon Solutions did not respond to a request for comment.
Reactions
Kathy Stockdale, a landowner from Iowa Falls, said she was happy to see the bill pass and was “extremely proud” of the 12 GOP senators who took a stand to force the legislation to come to a vote. At the same time, Stockdale said she was “deeply upset” as a Republican, with Senate leadership, and that she and many landowners would have preferred to see House File 943 pass.
“It doesn’t protect our private property rights,” she said.
However, she said the bill passed does provide some benefits to landowners: “It helps us in the IUC hearings. It does provide insurance for us. … It defines what a common carrier is, just like in South Dakota.”
While the measure passed the Senate, she said she is not sure it will be signed by Reynolds.
Thomson and Holt, who led the legislation in the House, hugged and shook hands with activists and landowners outside the Senate chambers after the bill’s passage.
Holt said Bousselot talking about being supportive of property rights was “disrespectful” considering his role in similar bills stalling in the Senate in recent sessions.
“Everybody that’s followed this knows that it has been Senator Bousselot, who formerly worked for Summit, who killed these pieces of legislation over and over again,” Holt said. “It’s so disingenuous and so disrespectful treating the citizens of Iowa like fools, so it was not a proud moment for me as a Republican.”
Holt said the bill’s Senate passage Monday was because of landowners and supporters who worked for years to push lawmakers to vote on the bill. He also credited House Republicans for introducing and passing measures in response to these calls in recent legislative sessions.
“We listened to the people of Iowa, and that is why this finally got done,” Holt said. “That is why the governor needs to sign it just as soon as possible.”

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
 
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is (Medicaid) is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
 
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”

But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”
Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

The plane is meant to be there, federal officials say. And it’s on a mission: to improve maps.
Outfitted with an elongated “boom” and cruising at altitudes as low as 300 feet above the ground, the U.S. Geological Survey is raising awareness about the flights, which begin in May over the Connecticut River Valley and will continue into the fall.
The flights, happening across much of New England, will image geology as part of a national effort to modernize geological maps in the region. The goal is to get better insight into mineral and water resources and natural hazards like earthquakes and radon, the agency says.
“Increasing knowledge of New England’s geologic framework will help with national priorities, like sourcing critical minerals, and regional concerns — like mapping pyrrhotite to minimize its use in local infrastructure,” said Jamey Jones, science coordinator for the USGS Earth Mapping Resources Initiative, in a statement.
Pyrrhotite is a mineral found in bedrock under certain parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts. It can cause long-term structural weakness in construction when used in cement, the USGS says. In Connecticut, pyrrhotite has adversely affected as many as 35,000 homes, condominiums and municipal buildings.
Instruments on the airplane will measure “variations in the Earth’s magnetic field and natural, low-level radiation created by different rock types beneath vegetation and up to several miles below the surface,” the agency says.
If the low-altitude thrum of the engine isn’t enough of a give-away, look to the plane’s tail (or its nose), which the USGS says will be equipped with an elongated “boom” that extends off the main cabin that houses sensors.
“These scientific instruments are completely passive with no emissions that pose a risk to humans, animals, or plant life,” the agency says.
Officials say that no photography or video data will be collected.
The plane will fly at about 300 feet above the surface in some areas. The ground clearance will increase to 1,000 feet over populated areas and will comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations, officials say.
About the flights

The post Greater Boston municipal leaders recommit to climate goals  ap[...]","WITH THE SWEEPING federal funding cuts for climate projects and moves by the Trump administration to roll back environmental protections, the leaders of 17 municipalities in the Greater Boston area came together on Monday to renew their commitment to working together on regional climate initiatives over the next decade. The coalition of mayors and city managers signed a commitment to advocate for climate resilience, more clean energy on the grid, decarbonizing buildings, and electrifying transportation with a regional strategy. “While this federal administration trades the truth for profits, we will continue showing the nation that we are still fighting for a better, brighter future,” said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, at the Museum of Science where the signing took place. “This work is going to take all of us because the climate crisis doesn’t care about city limits, but especially because it is city leaders who get things done. … Day by day, community by community, we are holding ourselves accountable to the results that our constituents need to see for this generation and the ones to come.” The coalition includes leaders from Arlington, Boston, Braintree, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Lynn, Malden, Melrose, Medford, Newton, Quincy, Revere, Somerville, Watertown, and Winthrop. These communities are all a part of a group called Metro Mayors Coalition, which was founded 25 years ago with the support of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council in order to promote information exchange and regional problem solving. The group signed a climate commitment in 2016 to set the goal of rapidly reducing carbon pollution to become a net-zero region by 2050. At the time 14 cities and towns signed on.  Since then, the group has established an inter-governmental climate task force to work with federal and state agencies, and local nonprofits on climate mitigation and adaptation work. The cities and towns have adopted a variety of policies and actions, like adopting greener energy building codes and expanding the placement of infrastructure for electric vehicles. “Over the last 10 years, you have been leaders and now you’re going to make a commitment for the next 10 years, setting an example for the rest of our nation,” said US Sen. Ed Markey, addressing the coalition on Monday. “And [with] this commitment of net zero for local resilience planning, our cities and towns are shepherding strong climate action and have set bold principles to set a strong example for the rest of the nation and the rest of the world. It shows what can be done.” Medford Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn brought up an ongoing effort to upgrade the Amelia Earhart Dam, which sits on the Mystic River between Somerville and Everett. It is at risk of potentially failing in the next 10 to 20 years, which will result in major flooding in more than seven different communities, according to Lungo-Koehn. “It’s a must that we work together regionally,” she said.  Lungo-Koehn said that funding from the state and federal government is crucial to complete this and other area projects, “It’s [our] federal delegation and the state delegation that are equipping us with the funds that we need, especially with what’s going on at the federal level in our new administration. It’s the fighters that are fighting for us to be able to give us the funds to do this great work.” Communities around Massachusetts are feeling the cuts to climate funding. The Environmental Protection Agency cut $20 million in grant funding that was supposed to go towards improving air quality in Springfield – a city with one of the highest rates of asthma in the country.  “It’s no surprise that Trump will go to any length, including by denying federal dollars to communities to prevent states like us, to prevent the communities that are right here today from continuing their work to end our reliance on fossil fuels,” said Markey. “This administration’s reign of chaos and despair comes from a place of cowardice because the oil and gas industry is afraid of what you all represent: this transition to a clean, renewable, sustainable future for our country led by what we are doing here in Massachusetts.” Chelsea is grappling with the loss of $50 million in federal money that would have funded a big part of the $120 million flood resilience project for the Island End River. The Island End River generates dramatic flooding during serious coastal storms, sending water rushing over the nearby roadways, commercial, and industrial sites.  “I’m not sure if we’re going to be able to continue this project,” said Chelsea City Manager Fidel Maltez. “We, of course, are not taking this lying down. We’re going to fight tooth and nail for our future, but any support that can be given as a region would be appreciated.” Rebecca Tepper, the state secretary of energy and environmental affairs, said at the event on Monday that the state is committed to helping municipalities in their climate resiliency and decarbonization efforts. She particularly flagged the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness program, which provides grant funding for cities and towns for climate change resiliency. “It really is vitally important that climate work…starts from the bottom up,” said Tepper. “Part of our role [as the state] is to make sure that you [the municipalities] have the resources and the information that you need to move forward with your projects.” The post Greater Boston municipal leaders recommit to climate goals  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250512_121017-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-13 10:02:30.086535

The rest of the year, it would be one hour behind that city, as Washington state observes daylight saving time. If Congress passes a bill allowing permanent daylight saving time, Alaska would return to being one hour behind Seattle permanently.
Merrick said her bill is supported by the state’s tourism trade association, as well as financial institutions, “because it keeps us within three or four hours of the stock market and financial center in New York.”
Daylight saving time has been a regular topic of conversation in the Alaska Legislature. 
The Alaska Senate voted to request the elimination of daylight saving time in 2015, but the House failed to pass the bill.
No DST bill was introduced in 2017 or 2018, but since then, a daylight saving time bill has been introduced in either the House or Senate every year since 2019. 
The bill goes in a different direction from Alaska’s neighbor, Yukon, which moved to permanent daylight time in 2020, leaving the territory geographically adjacent but two hours away, chronologically, from November through early March.
For a century, Alaska stretched over four time zones. That changed in 1983, when the state’s time zones were consolidated to two, with Yakutat being the only community that kept its previous time zone. The result means that in most parts of Alaska, the clock has little to do with the position of the sun in the sky.
Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks, proposed a competing bill that would move Alaska to permanent Alaska Standard Time, but that idea stalled out in committee.
“I do believe that permanent standard time makes more sense for daylight. It’s more in sync for where we’re at. However, because we’re at such a high latitude, it matters a lot less,” he said, explaining that the amount of daylight changes rapidly throughout the year.
Kawasaki ended up voting for the bill.
“My main issue with time is that you have to reset your clocks twice, and that’s a big pain in the ass,” he said.
Sens. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, and Robert Myers, R-North Pole, shared his concerns about solar time but voted against the bill. 
“I’ve opposed changing it numerous times over the years,” Stedman said.
“It just doesn’t work relative to sun time,” he said.
Myers said the bill has the potential to aggravate that problem.
“I am not a fan of the time zone change portion of that bill,” he said. “Most of Alaska … is already an hour off of where we should be solar time, and there are some studies out there dealing with both health and energy use that say we should stay close to solar time.”
“I really would love to see the federal government repeal daylight saving time across the board,” he said.
In April, President Donald Trump said he was open to the idea and urged Congress to pass a bill making daylight saving time permanent, thus eliminating the annual clock change.
That makes this the right time to pass SB 26, Merrick said.
“Having the federal administration on board greatly increases our chances of successfully  eliminating daylight saving time,” she said. “I know sometimes change is hard, but SB 26 will keep us from having to change our clocks, at least.”

On May 10, 1950, Congress established one of the world’s best value, highest impact, and, frankly, coolest science agencies. The NSF finances federal research in just about anything that’s not health (the National Institutes of Health do that).
It’s been a bit of a rough birthday party. Elon Musk’s “DOGE” has been cutting research funding right and left, including at least 13 grants at MSU at the last count. The director of NSF just resigned as the Trump administration announced plans to dissolve its 37 specialist divisions. Trump’s budget proposes cutting NSF by half. The money that would save? About $5 billion, which isn’t that far from the amount of money that the budget wants to give to SpaceX. And of course they are going especially hard after anything that implies a commitment to equity, diversity, or inclusion, whether it’s the whole NSF equity division or research on environmental justice in Detroit.
Michigan researcher’s work on air pollution and racial inequities caught in funding freeze

NSF, unlike the Trump administration, doesn’t “give” money to anybody for anything. It chooses grants for research on an enormously competitive basis – in the 2024 fiscal year, only 15.4% of NSF grant applications were funded. The government is paying universities to do the best possible research with NSF money, and it’s driving a very hard bargain. When a university, be it Harvard, Grand Valley State, or Albion College, gets a grant, it’s not getting a gift of tax money. It’s competing very hard for the right to do science that barely breaks even.
What does NSF do for us? One measure is direct spending. In Michigan, the NSF spent $262 million in fiscal year 2023. The University of Michigan ($132m), MSU, ($66m), and Michigan Tech ($15m) were the largest recipients, but practically every four-year school in Michigan won NSF support. NSF helps support economic engines for the whole state in the big schools, but equally imagine the seasonal, tourism-dependent economy of the Upper Peninsula without Michigan Tech’s success at winning competitive grants for its year-round scientific work.
Michigan also wins when the US wins. NSF works for all Americans, and often the whole world. Imagine the auto industry, or pretty much any industry, operating as it does today without 3D printing. NSF funded that. Artificial intelligence? NSF. The MRI machines that help doctors diagnose you? NSF. The Doppler radar technology that saves lives in severe weather and makes aviation far safer by conquering wind shear? NSF. Lasik? NSF.  Polar or undersea exploration? NSF. Duolingo‘s underlying programming? NSF. The internet itself? NSF. The list is a long one, and in each case it means a crucial sector that thrives because NSF took a bet on the underlying science that others commercialized.
It should be no surprise, then, that Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists found that federal science funding has implied returns between 140% and 210%- a fantastic investment by any standard and one that by design accrues to communities, small businesses, and all of us.
What happens when funding is interrupted, or cut? Scientists start to leave science, permanently, after as little as a month of interrupted funding. They certainly can find work, but it will probably be work that underuses their skills.
Meanwhile, what happens to the science that does get done when we take away federal funding? Researchers who lose federal support often get private industry funding, which sounds great until we see that it produces lower quality science that is less influential, contains less basic research that leads to breakthroughs, and is more likely to produce a benefit confined to a single business that paid for the research.
That America, of stagnant science and profiteering businesses, might appeal to real estate developer Donald Trump and technology hype man Elon Musk. It shouldn’t attract the rest of us.
Don’t forget that science is fast-moving, collaborative, and international. The European Union and some Canadian institutions are directly trying to recruit our scientists. China, a fierce scientific competitor, has for a long time seen many of its best minds move to the US, teach our students and work in our companies, because of the science ecology that the NSF supported. Trump and Musk are giving Beijing an opportunity to reverse the flow as our immigration and higher education policies make the United States an impossible option.
Cutting federal funding produces scientific stagnation that benefits only a few, short-termist, businesses. By replacing basic, public research with applied, private, research it makes the rich richer and deprives all of us of breakthroughs that come from basic research. And in a state like Michigan, cutting the NSF makes it all the more likely that we continue our decades-long slide from the technological leaders that we were a century ago.
NSF is 75 years young this month. In a better world, we would be strengthening it so it can make our lives even better in the coming years. Unfortunately, we are fighting to protect it, and if we lose the world, and the United States in particular, will be permanently worse off.

As Gov. Gavin Newsom pushes local governments to do more about removing homeless encampments across California, one of the state’s own agencies is being accused of not doing enough to clear illegal campsites, writes CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall.
On Monday the governor issued a “model ordinance” that cities and counties should use to clear encampments. These guidelines include banning persistent camping (or more than three days) in one location, banning encampments that block sidewalks and more. Newsom also said the state would release $3.3 billion to “communities statewide” to combat homelessness. The money comes from the $6.4 billion Proposition 1 that voters narrowly approved in March of last year. 
Though the governor can’t force local governments to adopt the ordinance, his request that they do so follows an executive order he issued last summer directing state agencies, including the California Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, to remove encampments. The agency is tasked to build and maintain highways, and spent more than $51 million addressing encampments in the 2023-24 fiscal year.
But city officials and staff say Caltrans still takes too long to sweep a camp, at times taking months to respond. In some extreme cases, camps remain for a year or two, said San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan.

Mahan: “The longer we allow people to remain encamped along the freeway or along an on and off ramp, the more the encampment becomes established and people come to the location and we get a significant accumulation of waste.”

Because city workers, for the most part, are prohibited from going onto Caltrans property to clear camps themselves, the Legislature is considering a bill that would make it easier for the agency to cooperate with local governments. 
The measure would require Caltrans to hire a liaison to work with cities and counties, and to arrange clear timelines when Caltrans should respond to a city’s request to clear an encampment. It would also allow Caltrans to reimburse cities for when they use their own resources and personnel to clear encampments on Caltrans property. 
The reimbursement provision is particularly popular among city officials: Mahan, for example, said it can cost as much as $100,000 to remove a long-standing encampment.

Assembly passes bill to fine social media companies

In a rare showing of bipartisanship, Democratic and Republican legislators in the Assembly on Monday spoke in support of a bill that would hold social media platforms financially liable up to $1 million for the harms they inflict on young users.

Assemblymember Josh Lowenthal, a Long Beach Democrat and bill author: “Across the aisle and across the world, we all know that these platforms are harmful and addictive. … In fact, some platforms seem to be flagrantly ignoring problems that we have identified by actively rolling back what little safeguards they’ve previously offered.”

The bill is one of several the Legislature is considering to rein in the damage technology companies can cause with their products, including chatbots and other artificial intelligence tools.
During the floor session, lawmakers brought up several examples of dangerous social media content, including bill co-author Assemblymember Joe Patterson, whose neighbor died from a fentanyl overdose in 2020 that was purchased through social media. The Rocklin Republican also cited a CalMatters op-ed about a young daughter developing an eating disorder after being flooded with pro-anorexia social media posts. 
The Assembly passed the bill with 59 “yes” votes on the floor. Though there were no votes in opposition, 20 legislators did not vote, which is the same as voting no.



What happened to prisoners released during COVID?

During the pandemic, the Newsom administration released thousands of people from state prisons as COVID spread through close quarters. 
Now, data obtained and analyzed by CalMatters shows for the first time what happened to some of those former prisoners. 
In total, between April 2020 and December 2021, the corrections department freed about 14,800 people early. Nearly one-third of those prisoners ended up back in prison.
The data shows that: 

Most prisoners who were released early steered clear of serious crimes that would land them back in prison. 
Thirty people returned to prison for first- or second-degree murder offenses, representing fewer than 1% of the group. 
The top three reasons people went back to prison were illegally possessing a gun (14% of all cases), assault (10%), and burglary (9%). Vehicle theft, second-degree robbery and domestic abuse each accounted for about 4% to 5% of offenses. 

Using news reports, press releases, statements from district attorneys and data from the corrections department, CalMatters’ Byrhonda Lyons pieces together the details of what happened to some of the thousands who went back to state prison.

A City Hall spokesperson said the law department must be perceived as non-political by the mayor's cabinet chiefs.
The post Wu administration puts City Hall attorney on leave amid his mayoral run appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE BOSTON City Hall attorney running against his boss, Mayor Michelle Wu, has been placed on administrative leave. John F. Houton, the assistant corporation counsel who jumped into the mayoral race earlier this month, said his superiors put him on administrative leave on Friday. City officials also told him that they were looking to hire outside counsel to sort out whether it was possible for him to mount a campaign, according to Houton. Houton said he believes it is an intimidation tactic by the Wu administration. He pointed to the mayor encouraging past employees to run for office, though he acknowledged the uniqueness of an attorney who works for the city to also run for the top job. “Everything has been above board by me,” he said. In a statement, a Wu administration spokesperson said the city’s office of human resources, in consultation with outside counsel, is handling employment decisions regarding Houton. The mayor is not involved, the spokesperson added. “In order to perform its essential functions, the Law Department’s work depends on being fully non-political in its operations, and, importantly, the Department must be perceived as non-political by Cabinet Chiefs and Department heads seeking advice and counsel,” the spokesperson said.  Wu is running for a second four-year term and is chiefly facing a challenge from Josh Kraft, the son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Both Wu and Kraft have gathered enough signatures – over 3,000 – to make it onto the ballot. Ten or so other people have expressed interest in running for mayor. Houton has worked as an attorney since the late Tom Menino’s mayoral administration, notching 18 years with City Hall. His current job involves serving as in-house counsel to the city’s treasury department. He said he opposes rent control, as Wu has proposed, and he believes city officials should cooperate more with the Trump administration and federal immigration officials. When Houton expressed interest in running for mayor in 2021, he sought guidance from superiors but received conflicting advice, he said. But he opted against a run and did not put his name on the ballot. “I let the deadline pass because I felt uncertain from their guidance about how this is going to play out,” he said. He expressed regret about the decision to stay out and now is focused on getting signatures to get his name on the 2025 ballot. The post Wu administration puts City Hall attorney on leave amid his mayoral run appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250512_164545-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C688&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-13 09:04:25.381108

Records obtained and analyzed by CalMatters offer the first glimpse into what happened to some of the former prisoners after state leaders chose to shrink a prison population imperiled by the pandemic.


Nearly one-third of California prisoners released early during the pandemic by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration ended up back in prison, according to California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation data. 
The records, obtained and analyzed by CalMatters, offer the first glimpse into what happened to some of the former prisoners after state leaders chose to shrink a prison population imperiled by the spread of COVID in close quarters. 
At the time, the governor and the corrections department did not widely share the full list of the names and crimes of the thousands of people they sent home early, leaving the public in the dark about the scope of an unprecedented prisoner release effort.
In total, between April 2020 and December 2021, the corrections department freed about 14,800 people early. Roughly 4,600 had gone back to prison as of Jan. 31, 2025. 
The data shows that most prisoners who were released early steered clear of serious crimes that would land them back in prison. Thirty people returned to prison for first or second-degree murder offenses, representing fewer than 1% of the group. 
The top three reasons people went back to prison were illegally possessing a gun (14% of all cases), assault (10%), and burglary (9%). Vehicle theft, second-degree robbery and domestic abuse each accounted for about 4 to 5% of offenses. The data only includes the offense that gave the prisoner the longest sentence.
Using news reports, interviews, press releases, statements from district attorneys and data from the corrections department, CalMatters pieced together the details of what happened to some of the thousands who went back to state prison.
Isaias Alfaro was released in August 2020, after serving time for taking a vehicle without consent. Two years later, he was back incarcerated for burglary. 
Alfaro said in an interview that he was “doing his damnest” to stay out of trouble and “live a better life” after he was released early. “I was going to school and staying on the right track,” he said. “I started using drugs again, and it was only a matter of time before I began having criminal activity in my life and ended up back in jail.” He said he wished the counties had more resources to help people who are struggling with drug and alcohol addictions. 
Alfaro was released in April 2023. He’s now living in Los Angeles with family and looking for work, he said.
Santiago Contreras, 44, said she told prison officials she didn’t want to be released. As a transgender woman, “I had nowhere to go,” she said. “It was hard to survive.” 
Contreras was in prison for stalking, vandalism and assault, according to the corrections department. 
State officials released her to San Diego County probation officials for supervision, and she was given an ankle monitor, she said. A few months later, she said, she started drinking again and cut the monitor. Contreras was on the run when she strangled 43-year-old Tonya Molina to death inside a San Diego motel room, she said. Contreras is now serving 15 years-to-life, the San Diego District Attorney’s Office said.
The corrections department and other criminal justice agencies define recidivism as when someone is convicted of a new crime within three years of their release. The department mainly uses conviction data to measure recidivism, not return-to-prison rates, according to an agency spokesperson. CalMatters’ data only includes return-to-prison rates, and it’s over a much longer period of time, nearly five years.
According to our analysis, 23% of people released early during the pandemic returned to prison in less than three years. There’s no baseline rate for returning to prison to compare that figure over a similar time period. It’s slightly higher than the 17% of people who returned to prison within three years after being released in 2019-2020, according to the department’s most recent recidivism report.
Across the country, researchers at the Robina Institute for Criminal Law and Criminal Justice estimated that nearly 81,000 people were released from prisons in 34 states and the federal prison system during the pandemic. In 2022, National Public Radio reported that of more than 11,000 people released from federal prison, 442 had returned to prison; 17 committed new crimes. In Oregon, the governor commuted the sentences of about 950 people between July 2020 through October 2021. Of those, about 12% ended up back incarcerated within two years of their release, a 2023 report found.
Newsom’s office declined to comment on this story. 
Corrections department spokesperson Albert Lundeen said that the higher return-to-prison rates among those who were released early weren’t uncommon. 
“People eligible for expedited release were non-serious/non-violent, a demographic with a higher tendency to recidivate,” he wrote in an email. “It is expected that return rates for this subgroup would be higher than overall recidivism rates.”

Some left prison with “non-serious/non-violent crimes,” only to commit more serious offenses shortly afterwards. 
Jammerieo Austin, 29, was released in April 2020, after serving time for possessing/purchasing cocaine for sale, the corrections department said. He was out of prison for a little over a year when he shot and killed 40-year-old Karmen Anderson while a four-year-old sat in the backseat, according to the San Diego District Attorney’s office. Austin’s now serving a life sentence without parole, the corrections department said.
In Los Angeles County, David Grace was released from prison in August 2020 after a burglary conviction. In June 2023, he went back to prison after pleading no contest to killing someone while drunk driving, according to the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office and data from the corrections department. In a news release, the Long Beach Police Department said Grace hit a 62-year-old father who was pushing a van alongside his daughter. 
During the pandemic, the early-release policy targeted people who were a few months away from leaving prison, serving a sentence for non-violent offenses, and those who did not have to register as sex offenders, the agency noted on its website. The agency also “excluded people serving a sentence for domestic violence,” Lundeen said.
The prisoners who’d earned credits while incarcerated for things like good behavior, completing milestones, rehabilitation and education saw some of their sentences reduced. 
Francisco Gomez, 40, had been in and out of state prison over more than a decade when he was sent back in 2017 for “unlawful sex with a victim under 16 and subject over 21,” according to the corrections department and court records. He was sentenced to eight years in prison, but he didn’t have to register as a sex offender. Madera County Supervising Deputy District Attorney Eric DuTemple said a rape conviction would require registration, but consensual sex with a minor who’s 16 years or older “would not be a registered offense, as in this case.”
The state released Gomez in August 2020. He was sent back to prison in February 2022 after being sentenced to eight years for burglary. Gomez is expected to be released again in July, state data show. 
In Tuolumne County, David Pacheco was first sentenced to prison for eight years in 2012 for employing a minor to sell a controlled substance and a few other crimes. He was released on parole in 2016, went back in 2019, and was released again in July 2020 during the pandemic.Within the year, Pacheco was arrested for using “Snapchat to send and receive sexually explicit images and videos with juveniles in exchange for marijuana products,” according to a Facebook post from the Tuolumne County Sheriff’s office.
Using colorful packages that looked like candy and snacks, Pacheco sold drugs to more than 100 minors, ranging from 8th graders to high schoolers, the sheriff’s office said. In June 2021, he was back in prison after being sentenced to 30 years for “rape with force / violence / fear of a minor 14 years of age or older,” among other crimes, according to the corrections department.
Keith Breazell, 35, was sent to prison for more than 15 years in 2014 for assault with a semiautomatic firearm and a gang enhancement, among other charges, the corrections department said. He was released on parole on July 21, 2020. 
In an interview, Breazell said that about a week after leaving state prison, he panicked and got into a high-speed chase with police. Soon after, in a separate incident, he was caught with a firearm. He was sent to federal prison and, when released, Breazell went back to state prison to serve time for fleeing the police, he said. Breazell’s expected to be released in December.
As the pandemic forced the state to quickly release people, thousands were released into communities with limited services to support them while the state was under strict shelter-in-place orders. 
Terah Lawyer, president of CROP, a nonprofit that helps people reenter society, said the lack of support may be one reason people ended up back in prison. 
“There was no funding available to … pick people up from prison, bring them to housing beds that were not available, provide them with any type of case management system,” Lawyer said. “This was a very, very trying time in our community.”
The early releases from state prisons and local jails, combined with changes in court policies like no bail for most misdemeanors and some felonies, led to population declines in the prison and jail systems. The Public Policy Institute of California found that the prison population dropped by 23% between March 2020 and February 2021 — its lowest point in more than three decades. The average daily jail population was down by 17% over the previous year by March 2021, a report from the California Policy Lab shows. 
Soon, stories began making the news of recently released people going on to commit more crimes. At least one sheriff complained publicly that people released early from prison were winding up in county jails. 
Then the public started growing concerned about local crime. 
A recent study from the Public Policy Institute of California found that the drop in property-crime arrests after the pandemic led to a rise in commercial burglaries. 
Some of the initial political blowback came with the ousting of progressive San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin in San Francisco. Since then, more district attorneys have been ousted and Californians overwhelmingly supported the state getting tougher on crime with the passage of Proposition 36, which allows felony charges for some drug and theft crimes and creates a new category of crime called “treatment-mandated” felonies.

The current system essentially penalizes them for having children.,"Guest Commentary written by

Erika Jones
Erika Jones is a kindergarten teacher in Los Angeles and secretary-treasurer of  the California Teachers Association.


As a Los Angeles kindergarten teacher, I am charged with caring for, teaching and launching into the world the youngest Angelenos, yet I’m having a hard time finding time to take care of my own daughter. 
In a month meant to celebrate both mothers and teachers, I’m reflecting on my own journey of parenthood and wondering when we are going to finally fix this broken system in California that penalizes educators for having children. 
In August 2023, I gave birth to my first child, Josephine. Bringing her into the world was one of the greatest moments of my life. And she continues to be a joy, but she’s also a struggle to care for beyond just sleepless nights.  
I, like other teachers and school employees across the state, receive zero paid pregnancy or maternity leave. Schools in Los Angeles and throughout California treat pregnancy as an illness. An educator who takes leave because of a pregnancy or to recovery after giving birth is forced to use accumulated sick leave.
Once their sick leave is exhausted, teachers then go on differential pay. That means they are paid their salary minus the cost of a substitute teacher, resulting in a 50% or greater pay cut.
In California, 73% of the teaching workforce is composed of women. Because women giving birth tend to be younger and teachers having children are generally at an earlier stage in their careers, most, like me, will not have banked enough sick leave to carry them through a pregnancy-related absence. They’ll have to go on differential pay.
This loss of sick leave to pregnancy-related disability is a double-dose of gender discrimination. Not only are most women forced to exhaust their sick leave early in their careers, they also are less likely than their male colleagues to have banked an adequate amount of leave if they later have a serious illness or medical need. 
I can’t tell you how many conversations I’ve had in the teachers’ lounge with female teachers still recovering from childbirth — or a miscarriage — who are forced back to work. Or, mothers who are sick and should be home but are working because they don’t have enough leave to fall back on. 
In the 1970s, it was common to be pushed out of teaching or fired once you became pregnant. It wasn’t until 1978 that Congress passed a law making that illegal. And yet, nearly 50 years later, pregnant educators are still being pushed out of the classroom because they don’t have enough paid leave.

More sick days and family leave? California lawmakers push to improve work-life balance 

by Rya Jetha 





California is facing a severe teacher shortage. Among the factors driving this: a high rate of retirements, educators choosing to leave due to stress, political attacks on the profession, low pay compared to other fields, high levels of student debt, and a lack of support systems. 
The absence of paid maternity leave is certainly also a contributing factor — one that can be addressed. There is Assembly Bill 65, the Pregnancy Leave for Educators Act, which would grant public school employees up to 14 weeks of leave with full pay when an employee is pregnant or experiences pregnancy-related health issues.
It’s important legislation that is long overdue. The bill would bring California into alignment with a worldwide, fundamental standard for reproductive rights. Most advanced democracies are far ahead of us in treating maternity leave as a human right. According to the World Economic Forum, the United States is the only wealthy country that does not have a national parental leave policy for parents.
At a time when federal funding for our schools is under attack, California can commit to investing in our schools with measures that will recruit and retain highly skilled educators for our students. Don’t penalize teachers for having and taking care of their children.

Gavin Newsom ordered state agencies to clear homeless encampments from their properties last summer, holding up the California Department of Transportation as an example of how it should be done.
But in the more than nine months since, cities up and down the state have complained that Caltrans isn’t doing enough. City officials and staff say the state agency is slow, sometimes taking months to respond to their requests to clear an encampment. They complain the agency doesn’t consistently tell them when it plans to clear a camp. In at least one city, officials have no idea if Caltrans is offering services to the homeless people it kicks off its land. 
And for the most part, city workers are barred from going onto Caltrans property to do the job themselves. 
“The way it’s set up right now isn’t working,” said Jorgel Chavez, mayor of Bell Gardens — a city of nearly 40,000 on the outskirts of Los Angeles. “It’s too long. Folks are frustrated.”
A bill making its way through the Legislature seeks to change that by pushing Caltrans to better collaborate with cities. Senate Bill 569 would require the state agency to hire a liaison to communicate with local governments, and lay out timelines that make it clear when Caltrans should respond after a city asks it to clear an encampment.
The bill also would make it easier for cities to go onto Caltrans property and use their own resources and personnel to remove encampments and offer services. It would allow, but not require, Caltrans to reimburse cities for those efforts.
Caltrans refused an interview request and did not respond to emailed questions about its process for working with cities to clear encampments, or about the Senate bill. The agency hasn’t publicly endorsed or opposed the bill. 
The bill comes amid a statewide push to remove homeless camps, and sometimes arrest the people in them, despite a widespread shortage of housing and shelters. Newsom on Monday urged cities and counties to adopt a model ordinance that would make camping in one place for more than three days illegal.  
The U.S. Supreme Court last year found that cities can make it illegal to sleep outside in a public place, even if there is nowhere else for someone to go. Since then, more than two dozen California cities and counties have enacted new encampment bans, brought back old bans or made their ordinances more punitive. 
As cities push unhoused people off their downtown sidewalks and out of their parks, people often resort to sleeping on Caltrans land — alongside highway on and off ramps, on medians or under overpasses. Sleeping so close to cars whizzing by carries its own risks, but it can buy them time, as Caltrans tends to take longer than cities to clear encampments. 
Meanwhile, Caltrans is in the midst of a sometimes fraught transition from an agency tasked with building and maintaining highways to an agency increasingly also burdened with the difficult responsibility of humanely dismantling homeless encampments and helping unhoused residents access scarce shelter. In 2020, the agency agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle a lawsuit claiming it illegally destroyed the belongings of homeless people living on its land. Unhoused people and Caltrans workers have complained about cruel treatment and chaotic conditions during sweeps. A homeless woman was struck by machinery and killed during a Caltrans encampment sweep in Modesto in 2018.
The National Health Care for the Homeless Council has found encampment sweeps can have adverse effects on the health of displaced residents, put their safety at risk and undermine their efforts to get into housing.
Sen. Catherine Blakespear, the author of the Senate bill and a Democrat from Encinitas, said her goal is not to move unhoused people from one outdoor location to another, and that she recognizes the need to build more temporary and permanent housing — something her bill does not address. But having people living in public spaces, especially next to speeding traffic, is a “true disaster,” she said.
“I just wish Caltrans would handle the problems on their property,” she said. “But that’s not happening.”
‘We just keep swapping back and forth’
In July, Newsom signed an executive order requiring state agencies to adopt policies for clearing encampments on their properties — and held up Caltrans’ efforts as a model of success. 
Since then, there has been a steady drumbeat of complaints from city leaders, said Caroline Grinder, community services legislative advocate for the League of California Cities. There’s no universal model for how Caltrans should involve city personnel when clearing a camp, so the process varies widely. Some cities say their relationship with the state agency is great. 
“To other cities, it’s a real challenge to get Caltrans to respond, and they have a hard time working with them to address encampments,” Grinder said. 
In a recent League of California Cities survey, 40% of cities said coordinating with state agencies was a barrier to addressing encampments. They said it’s the biggest hurdle they face, after a lack of services and a lack of funding.

“This is up and down the state, in all different kinds of communities,” Grinder said. 
CalMatters requested data from Caltrans on encampment removals in January, which the state agency has yet to provide. 
Caltrans has funding for 30 “encampment coordinators” that manage camps along its roadways. Before removing a camp, Caltrans is supposed to warn occupants 48 hours in advance (unless the camp is deemed to pose an imminent threat to life, health, safety or infrastructure), according to the agency’s encampment policy. Once the sweep starts, people remaining at the camp are supposed to get “a reasonable amount of time” to remove their belongings, and Caltrans is supposed to store any personal items left behind. The policy also states that staff should contact service providers to request outreach at the encampment. 
In San Diego, the largest, most visible encampments tend to be on Caltrans land, said Franklin Coopersmith, deputy director of San Diego’s Environmental Services Department and head of its Clean SD effort. The city receives more than 300 complaints each month about encampments on Caltrans land. City staff can’t address them, so instead, they tell residents to fill out an online form on Caltrans’ customer service webpage. 
In San Jose, it can take weeks or months for Caltrans to remove an encampment. In some extreme cases, camps have lingered for a year or two, said Mayor Matt Mahan. After Caltrans clears a site, people return immediately, because they know the state agency won’t be back for three to six months, he said. 
“The longer we allow people to remain encamped along the freeway or along an on and off ramp, the more the encampment becomes established and people come to the location and we get a significant accumulation of waste,” he said. It can cost between $50,000 and $100,000 to remove a long-standing encampment, he said. 
San Jose has a staff of 40 outreach workers and experience preventing people from returning to encampments, Mahan said. It would be more efficient for everyone, he said, to let San Jose take over sweeps on Caltrans land and get reimbursed. 
San Jose is negotiating an agreement with Caltrans that Mahan hopes will let the city clear certain encampments along on and off ramps in East San Jose.
Los Angeles reached a similar agreement with Caltrans last year.
Blackspear’s bill, which Mahan supports, would make it easier for other California cities to set up similar deals. It would require Caltrans to create a publicly accessible online database of these agreements (called delegated maintenance agreements) that other cities can use as a jumping-off point for negotiations. 
Riverside has been trying to negotiate such a deal with Caltrans since September, said Mayor Patricia Lock Dawson. In the meantime, the city and the state agency aren’t always on the same page. Caltrans doesn’t consistently tell the city when it’s going to clear a camp, according to the mayor’s office, and the mayor’s staff doesn’t even know if Caltrans offers people services before forcing them off its property.
As a result, unhoused people bounce from Caltrans property, to city property, and back to Caltrans property without getting off the street, Lock Dawson said. 
“We just keep swapping back and forth and it’s really inefficient,” she said. 
Riverside has submitted more than 70 requests for encampment removals on Caltrans property so far this year, according to the mayor’s office. It generally takes between two days and two weeks for the state agency to clear those camps. 
Caltrans spent more than $51 million addressing encampments in the 2023-24 fiscal year, according to an analysis of Blackspear’s bill by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
If the bill passes, Caltrans told the committee it would cost about $200,000 per year to hire the “liaison” tasked with overseeing communication between the state agency and local governments. If the agency reimburses cities and counties for clearing encampments, those costs could balloon into the tens of millions of dollars annually, according to the committee’s cost analysis.
The reimbursement proposal has been popular among city officials and staff.
“Outreach is not cheap,” said Coopersmith, of San Diego. His city spends about $675,000 per year on four outreach workers who have permission to go onto Caltrans land and offer shelter (if it’s available) and other services before encampment sweeps.
“Placement is not cheap,” he said. “Police, encampment disposal, all of this costs money. We also need to ensure that if we’re working on any type of state property, we want to make sure that we’re compensated for it.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/021422-FRESNO-HOMELESS-LV-03-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-13 09:04:25.381108

His metaphor, Spendlove told attendees of a conference hosted by the tax watchdog group, the Utah Taxpayers Association, at the Grand America in Salt Lake City on Monday, is a “variation” of the gray rhino.

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)
“This is the orange rhino,” he said, drawing laughs when his Powerpoint presentation presented a slide of an angry, charging rhino with President Donald Trump’s signature hair style — an image Spendlove said he asked ChatGPT to help create. 
Levity aside, Spendlove — who began his presentation by saying no matter the source, economic analyses always have some level of bias, including his — said he’s heard plenty of takes about Trump’s approach, especially when it comes to tariffs. 
“I’ve heard a lot of people talking about Donald Trump saying he’s crazy, he’s stupid, he’s unpredictable,” he said. “I’m here to tell you, that he is none of those things. That his policy is founded on deep roots. Whether you agree or disagree … you need to understand that there is policy behind what they’re doing. There is a strategy. And it is very predictable.” 
In an effort to interpret Trump’s economic strategy, Spendlove said when it comes to Trump, “you should not take him literally, but you better take him seriously.” 
“And what you’ve seen over the last three months is too many people taking him literally and not taking him seriously,” Spendlove said. “And that is causing confusion. It’s causing chaos in the markets.” 
‘Economic revolution’
Many economists watching the impact of the Trump administration’s trade policies warn that tariffs and the ensuing trade wars have elevated the risk of recession, stirred uncertainty and will likely lead to increased prices for consumers and businesses.  
But Spendlove, in an analysis that was largely complimentary of what Trump is trying to accomplish, boiled down the president’s economic policy as an effort to “reindustrialize, reprivatize and refocus” the U.S. economy. 
He quoted directly from several of Trump’s posts on Truth Social, saying “he makes it really clear” what he wants to do. From one of the posts, Spendlove highlighted Trump saying “THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.” 
New report sheds more light on how tariffs could impact Utah — but uncertainty still abounds

Spendlove noted that Trump’s tariff proposals are constantly changing as he negotiates with other countries — pointing to the news Monday morning that the U.S. and China both agreed to slash tariffs, with the U.S. lowering them from 145% to 30% while China agreed to lower its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods down from 125% to 10%. In response, “the markets are rallying,” he said. 
Those negotiations, along with the president’s other tariffs that range from what he calls “reciprocal” tariffs on 75 countries and tariffs on a wide range of industries and materials, are meant to push a return to tariff rates seen more than a century ago — all to encourage increased manufacturing in the U.S., cut down on reliance on other countries, and strengthen the U.S.’s global competitiveness with other rising world powers, especially China.  
“Trump often talks about the tariffs from the 1800s. That’s where he wants to go,” Spendlove said. “This is a rewriting of the paradigm. It is an economic revolution, and they’re rejecting the globalism that has existed for the last 100 years.”
Additionally, another big goal of the Trump administration is to reduce the U.S.’s increasing trade deficit. “What they say is we’re getting a bunch of cheap crap from China, and we’re exporting our wealth, and that can only continue for so long,” Spendlove said. 
Spendlove also predicted where it will all “settle out.” 
“Maybe we settle out around 10% to 15% (tariffs), maybe even settle out around 30%,” Spendlove said. “But I’ll tell you, 10 years from now, I don’t think we’re back to 3%. I think we’re in a new era of higher tariffs moving forward.” 
Along with slashing federal spending, cutting government regulations, and lowering income taxes and encouraging more workforce participation, Spendlove said the Trump administration wants to address “some of those big issues that we haven’t been willing to address for too long.”

“You’ve got to take the policies together. Yes, the tariffs hurt. Yes, slowing migration hurts. Reducing government spending and support is hard for those that rely on it,” Spendlove said. “But you’re going to see dramatically lower taxes, supporting the domestic workforce (and) deregulation.” 
Spendlove also acknowledged that an economic downturn is more likely than it was at the beginning of the year. But he also said even though consumer confidence is down and “lower-income groups are getting stressed,” data isn’t showing a slowdown in the labor market or rising inflation. 
“We could see it,” he acknowledged, “but we haven’t seen it yet.” 
‘Tariffs are tax increases’
Spendlove’s presentation had an optimistic tone. But another presenter who took the podium not long after him had a more pessimistic outlook as he explained the economic implications of tariffs and the impact they’ll have on consumers and businesses. 
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects for the Tax Foundation, which describes itself as a leading nonpartisan tax policy nonprofit, said he’s “more concerned about the economic impacts.”
“Partially because I’m not sure the (Trump) administration itself really has a consistent theory of what these tariffs are supposed to do,” Walczak said, adding that federal officials have not “put out any economic estimates whatsoever on what they expect from these tariffs.” 
The Tax Foundation has an online tracker documenting the impacts of Trump’s tariffs, which he said has become “very long and really complex because seemingly every week or so there’s a significant change in what the tariff policy is.” 
Even with the recent rollback of China’s tariffs, Walczak said, “we’re talking right now about some pretty significant tariffs.” Bottom line, he said “tariffs are tax increases” that impact businesses and consumers. 
“Fundamentally, this is one of the largest tax increases” in the U.S. in decades, perhaps even modern history, he said. 
Utah GOP leaders defend Trump’s tariffs while bracing for economic ‘turbulence’

While he said the Trump administration is using tariffs as a tool to encourage domestic production in the U.S., “there are a lot of problems with this,” Walczak said, adding that it’s encouraging the U.S. to shift away from industries that it’s “good at” — like high-end manufacturing — in favor of “less productive things.” 
“We don’t make a lot of textiles. We make a lot of airplane parts. We don’t make a lot of low-end plastic goods, (but) we make a whole lot of information technology,” he said. 
Walczak also said many economists warn against tariffs because they have been shown to actually discourage production, not encourage it. He pointed to steel tariffs under former President George W. Bush, which he said negatively impacted jobs downstream of the steel industry that used partially imported steel. 
“You lost significant numbers of jobs, even in the targeted industry … and certainly in the broader economy because of the higher cost of the imports,” he said. 
So while Trump is characterizing his economic policy as a “win” for American consumers and businesses, Walczak said “that has not been the experience of tariffs in the past.” 
“Tariffs reduce economic outputs and income, they function like a consumption and reduction tax,” he said. 
Even by optimistic estimates, Walczak said Trump’s tariffs, as currently proposed, “would lose about 550,000 jobs, just on the U.S. side of this.” That all depends on how other countries respond and what plays out next. But retaliatory tariffs, he said, results in losses for both sides. 
“That’s the problem with tariffs. It creates this tax wedge,” he said, “where the consumer is getting less for their money, the producer is getting less value. There is a cost in the middle. And it’s a really inefficient cost. If you are going to raise taxes for some reason, this would not be how you do it. … You are discouraging capital investment. You are distorting labor markets. You are distorting production markets.” 
Walczak apologized that he brought “such a negative message” to a room that was full of many conservative lawmakers, “but this is burdensome for the U.S. consumer who will have lower purchasing power, will have lower incomes over time.” 
“It’s bad for American workers because businesses are affected by tariffs, they raise their prices or they reduce their income,” he said. “All of these effects will happen. It’s just a question of balance.” 
He said most economists widely agree that tariffs are bad economic policy. 
“The Trump administration is a little bit out on its own on these things,” he said. “So in terms of business impact, I would be concerned.”

The 2026 General Fund Gov. Kay Ivey signed last week makes funding for the board dependent on drafting new parole guidelines that determine the likelihood that an applicant can be safely released on parole. The budget goes into effect on Oct. 1.

“When a state entity does not follow state law, I think it is incumbent upon us in our oversight role to do whatever we need to do, or can do, to help them follow state law,” he said in an interview last week.  “And the power of the purse is really about the only tool that we have to do that.”
The Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles did not return messages sent last week seeking comment.
Lawmakers also cut the General Fund allocation to the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, the agency that oversees reentry and rehabilitation for people in the custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections, by 4.1%, bringing it from $94.5 million to $90.6 million.
Missed deadline

Lawmakers enacted legislation in 2019 that updated rules on parole, part of a broader overhaul of the parole system after Jimmy O’Neal Spencer, who had been serving two life sentences, was mistakenly released on parole in late 2017. The following year, Spencer killed three people, including a seven-year-old child, during a robbery in Guntersville. Spencer was later convicted of the murders and sentenced to death.
The 2019 law required the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles to update the parole guidelines within three years, based on evidence and data for those who were released.
The Parole Board missed the 2022 deadline and has yet to release an updated version required by state law.
Several lawmakers expressed frustration with the Parole Board, particularly chair Leigh Gwathney, after they did not receive any response from a set of questions concerning the low parole rate and their process for deciding who should be granted parole and who should be denied that were submitted in the spring of 2024.
At a meeting of  the Joint Legislative Prison Oversight Committee meeting in October, Gwathney gave meandering replies to lawmakers’ questions. Chambliss demanded that Gwathney provide her responses by the end of November.
They never received any response.
“We didn’t get a response,” Chambliss said. “When the Attorney General’s Office got involved and asked questions, apparently a response was prepared in November, but we never got it.”

‘Defying the Legislature openly’

Chambliss said that he only made his final decision to introduce the amendment shortly before he took the floor on April 29. But Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, one of the most vocal critics of the Parole Board, said he understood it could be a possibility when he learned that lawmakers were discussing the proposal among themselves toward the start of the current legislative session.
England said the amendment is the result of actions of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, particularly Gwathney.
“The money being taken away isn’t to suggest that the Bureau is doing a good job with reentry and rehabilitation, but it is to focus on the fact that the chair, who has been there since 2019, is not following the law and defying the Legislature openly.”
The amendment was one of several actions taken by Democrats and Republicans in an attempt to create additional oversight for the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles that they believe has flouted their oversight authority.
SB 324, also sponsored by Chambliss, would increase the number of Parole Board members from three to five and allow members of the Board to appoint their own chair instead of the governor making the appointment.
HB 40, sponsored by England, would create a commission that would create a validated risk and needs assessment, as well as parole release and classification guidelines for people in custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections. It would also requires the Parole Board to adhere to the parole guidelines when making decisions and disclose reasons for not adhering to them in any parole decision.
But with just one day left in the 2025 session, neither bill seems likely to get to Gov. Kay Ivey’s desk. England’s legislation remains stalled in the House chamber. Chambliss’ bill has passed the Senate and squeaked though the House Judiciary Committee in April, but will compete with many other bills seeking approval on the final day of the session Wednesday.
That leaves the amendment, which says that the board’s funding for “personnel and employee benefit costs” will be released “after the board revises and adopts guidelines concerning the granting or denial of paroles, and make available on the Board’s website.”
“My guess and my hope are that they will update the guidelines,” Chambliss said. “If they do that, then it is a moot point. I am pretty confident, I heard they are working on it.”
His amendment received unanimous support from the Senate when it was introduced.
“We do that all the time with money, that is a stick that legislators have that if someone is not following the law, whatever that may be, to use money to say, ‘Hey, if you are not going to do this, then we are going to withhold funds,’” said Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Parole decline
Parole rates declined dramatically, falling to the single digit percentages at times during 2023 before increasing slightly to roughly 25%. The parole rates were low even though the conformance rates, the percentage that the decisions of the Parole Board aligned with the recommendations based on the parole guidelines, was about 20%.
During the meeting in October, Gwathney said she altered the score sheets to favor parole applicants, and even then, the parole rate remained low.
“What we wanted was several years of data to figure out if the guidelines worked or not, but since they were not being followed, and the conformance rate was so low, and the chair admitted to changing them to fit whatever goals she had, not only do we not have the data, but the data is corrupted,” England said. “We wasted a bunch of time, and we wasted a bunch of money.”
Controversy regarding the parole rate has become so problematic that civil rights groups have weighed in on the issue.
“It is good to see a little added accountability with some financial strings attached to it to ensure compliance with, honestly, what the Parole Board is supposed to have been doing for years,” said Jerome Dees, policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit civil rights group.

All states, with the exception of Alaska, rely on provider taxes to help increase the amount of Medicaid funding they receive from the federal government. A Senate Finance Committee document from January estimates a savings to the federal budget of $175 billion over a decade by eliminating the tax.
Nevada has a 6% provider tax in place on nursing facilities and hospitals.  In 2023, Gov. Joe Lombardo’s budget estimated the tax would generate $388 million in the 2024/25 fiscal year. 
“I think you’ll see some more ‘WTF’ moments,” Horsford said of the mark up sessions during a phone interview Monday, harkening back to his exchange last month during a House hearing with a U.S. trade representative, who said he learned while testifying that Trump had paused some tariffs. 
“He announced it on a Tweet?” Horsford barked at the official. “WTF! Who’s in charge?” 
Hours before the pause, Trump, via social media, advised investors to buy stocks, leading to questions about improper manipulation of the markets and allegations that Trump insiders are profiting from the president’s political moves.  
On Monday, Bloomberg reported that purchasers of Trump’s $TRUMP meme coin spent $148 million to win a chance at dining with Trump at his private golf club later this month, according to crypto intelligence firm Inca Digital. 
Trump’s move to “invite his biggest investors from his crypto meme” to the event “flies in the face of logic and ethics,” Horsford said. 
Horsford says Trump’s assertion Sunday that the U.S. will accept a 747-8 jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family to replace Air Force One violates the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits a federal officer from accepting gifts and other benefits from a foreign government, without approval from Congress. 
“This president doesn’t give a ‘f’ about standards,” Horsford said. “The Supreme Court basically said he has full immunity to do anything that he chooses as the president, and he’s definitely showing that now in the first 100 days of this presidency.”
‘Oh, give me a home…’ 
So far this year, Congress has passed half a dozen bills, leaving the government to operate largely on executive fiat. 
Horsford is hoping legislation aimed at curtailing corporate buying of housing stock nationwide will resonate on both sides of the aisle. 
Almost one-third of homes in North Las Vegas and 15% of homes in Las Vegas “are owned by these corporate, out-of-state hedge funds,” Horsford said, which are targeting “working-class neighborhoods that are predominantly Black and Latino.”
Horsford’s Housing Oversight and Mitigating Exploitation Act of 2025 (HOME Act) would make it illegal for corporate investors to sell or rent at unreasonable prices during an affordable housing crisis. 
“Even when they convert the property to a rental, they’re gouging renters, charging upwards of 30% more, evicting at higher rates, and not maintaining the properties,” Horsford said, adding the “bill has gotten traction. There are Republicans who identify that it’s a problem.”
Another bill, Utilizing National Land for Opportunities and Community Key (UNLOCK), seeks to make federal land available, “especially for multi-family properties,” says a news release. Unlike other measures sponsored by Nevada congressional delegates, Horsford’s would allow the Bureau of Land Management to not only sell, but also lease land to local governments and Native American tribes. 
Horsford joined other Nevada Democrats who condemned Rep. Mark Amodei, the state’s only Republican in Congress, for submitting a last-minute amendment last week to the Republican budget package that would sell off nearly 450,000 acres of public lands in Nevada, some of it in Clark County. 
Income generated from the sale of Nevada’s public lands in the amendment would not fund projects in Nevada, as portions of federal land sales income have in the past. Instead it would be siphoned to the U.S. Treasury to help cover the Trump administration’s proposed tax cuts, according to the amendment.
“Obviously, I take offense to my colleague from the north offering an amendment in the dead of the night that had no advance notice, no consultation with me or my office,” Horsford said Monday. “He doesn’t represent one square inch of Clark County. I do, and my constituents should always have a say when it comes to the land legislation dealing with Southern Nevada.” 
A third bill introduced by Horsford, the Housing Market Transparency Act, would require states and the federal government to maintain data on properties that receive Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC). 
“We need transparency for landlords who are still receiving tax credits because they have a requirement to keep those units affordable for the term of the tax credit,” he said, adding there’s currently no effort to ensure that’s happening.
Horsford and fellow Nevada Democratic Rep. Susie Lee were among 35 Democrats who joined Republicans early this month  in voting to eliminate an Environmental Protection Agency waiver that allowed California to set its own emission standards, including a mandate that all passenger cars sold by 2035 be emission-free. 
“The vote I took opposes the California Clean Car waiver, because it puts too much pressure on the industry to actually meet the requirements, because of all of the uncertainty that’s coming from Donald Trump and the tariffs,” Horsford said. “Literally, they don’t have the ability to stay on track. My commitment to electric vehicles and to renewables remains sound, but I support giving additional flexibility.”
Horsford said he was unaware of a Government Accounting Office directive that Congress did not have the authority to repeal the waiver.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/horsford-at-aoc-rally-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-13 08:05:37.753361

During the Civil War, Robert Smalls and other Black Americans who were enslaved commandeered an armed Confederate ship in Charleston. Wearing a straw hat to cover his face, Smalls disguised himself as a Confederate captain. His wife, Hannah, and members of other families joined them. 
Smalls sailed safely through Confederate territory by using hand signals contained in the captain’s code book, and when he and the 17 Black passengers landed in Union territory, they went from slavery to freedom.

After the war ended, he returned to his native Beaufort, South Carolina, where he bought his former slaveholder’s home (and allowed his widow to live there until her death). He served five terms in Congress, one of more than a dozen Black Americans to serve during Reconstruction. He also authored legislation that enabled South Carolina to have one of the nation’s first free and compulsory public school systems and bought a building to use as a school for Black children. 
After Reconstruction ended, however, white lawmakers passed laws to disenfranchise Black voters. 
“My race needs no special defense for the past history of them and this country,” he said. “All they need is an equal chance in the battle of life.”

But the sponsors of the bills – one a Democrat; one a Republican — feel they managed to move the issue forward. 
“We may not have won the war on postpartum depression, but we certainly got a victory in the battle,” said Rep. Frances Holk-Jones, R-Foley.

As originally filed, HB 322, sponsored by Holk-Jones, and SB 191, sponsored by Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, would have required the Alabama Medicaid Agency to provide and cover postpartum depression screenings and to cover specific prescription drugs used to treat depression. The bills would also have removed a requirement that those suffering from postpartum depression go through separate 30-day treatment trials with at least two generic antidepressants before covering an FDA-approved therapy for postpartum depression like Zurzuvae.
Melanie Cleveland, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Medicaid Agency, said in an email Friday that the agency no longer requires patients with postpartum depression to try less expensive generic medicine before getting approved for pricier treatments. Cleveland said that FDA-approved medication for postpartum depression will no longer depend on two prior failed therapies.
“That’s a step in the right direction,” Holk-Jones said.
Medicaid covers mental health treatment for low-income mothers up to a year after childbirth. But significant obstacles prevent many from receiving adequate care, forcing some women to go without treatment until they are in crisis.  These barriers include Medicaid’s underfunding, which leads to low reimbursement rates for therapists and limits the number who accept Medicaid, and issues with administrative requirements, lack of transportation and childcare, and limited telehealth accessibility. 
The initial version of the bill would have mandated universal postpartum depression screenings for new mothers as part of the postnatal care model. The bill would also have required the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) to develop educational materials on postpartum depression for health care professionals and parents of newborns.

Holk-Jones’ bill was amended in the House Health Committee to focus only on educational material that would have been developed by ADPH, which the House passed unanimously. Figures’ Senate bill was also amended in committee to reflect the changes in the House, but the Senate never voted on it. 
Figures said that although the remaining educational provisions of the bill did not become law, it is something that the department could do without statute.
“They can do that on their website. If the bill does not pass, the health department can still do that, too,” Figures said, but she said that “the major thing that needed to be done was done without a statute,” referring to the requirement that people not fail two prior medications.
Jennifer Harris, a health policy advocate at Alabama Arise, a nonprofit organization focusing on poverty issues, said that while some providers already provide screenings, the new policy allows providers to assess patient needs without being subject to cost-saving controls.
“One of the administrative changes they made was that the provider should be able to assess the needs for the patient, and if not, if it doesn’t meet the criteria of being the least costly, less evasive, medication first, then they’re able to prescribe that medication that the mother would need,” Harris said.
Despite changes in Medicaid’s policy, Holk-Jones said there was still a critical need for the legislation, pointing to the prevalence of postpartum depression in Alabama.
“I do think this bill is absolutely needed, especially for all of the mothers with newborns who are dealing with the difficult mental health issue of postpartum depression,” Holk-Jones said.
Mental health care for new moms is critical. And hard to access.

Nearly 19% of mothers had frequent postpartum depressive symptoms in Alabama in 2021, compared to 12.7% of mothers nationwide, according to latest March of Dimes data.
Holk-Jones also said that untreated postpartum depression is not only damaging to the mother’s health, but can also have more significant economic costs, including long-term health care costs from emergency intervention and “long-term mental health issues that have damaging effects on both the mother and their child.”
She said this was “a genuine attempt” to address an issue that affects more people in Alabama than in other states. She will pre-file the bill for the next legislative session, saying “it is time we address this issue.”
“This bill … is about making sure every woman, no matter where she lives, gets screened and supported. That’s the standard we should all be working toward and that is why I will be refiling this legislation again next session,” Holk-Jones said.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)One candidate for governor has accused an opponent of “a long history of corruption.”
Another called his chief rival a “professional liar.”
Yet another produced an ad depicting him boxing President Donald Trump.
And another was arrested last week by federal agents during a protest outside a new migrant jail in Newark.
Welcome to the wild race for New Jersey governor, which features 11 candidates and is potentially the most competitive race for the state’s top job in half a century. Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, is stepping down in January after two terms, and six Democrats and five Republicans are vying in the June 10 primary for their party’s nomination to succeed him.
The drama of the race has increased significantly in recent days with the May 9 arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat accused of trespassing at Delaney Hall, the new migrant jail.
Speaking to reporters in Newark on Saturday, Baraka attacked the Trump administration for making law firms afraid to represent certain clients and causing judges and elected officials to fear getting arrested for “behaving in their conscience.”
“This is authoritarianism. There is no other way to describe what’s happening in this country right now but authoritarianism,” he said. 
Baraka’s arrest elicited a rare moment of unity among Baraka’s opponents, who all condemned his arrest. Three of them made their own appearances outside Delaney Hall on Saturday to highlight their opposition.
Asked for his thoughts on the statements of support from his rivals, Baraka said with a smile, “I’m glad that they are, you know, making the most of this.”
Baraka is joined in the race for the Democratic gubernatorial nod by Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill, teachers union chief Sean Spiller, and former state Sen. Steve Sweeney.

Sherrill took aim at President Donald Trump over Baraka’s arrest at an appearance in Cranford Saturday. Speaking to more than 100 people crowded in the gymnasium of a community center in this Union County town, Sherrill likened the masked federal immigration agents that arrested Baraka to secret police, worrying the administration would broaden its net to target dissidents in addition to immigrants who lack permission to be in the United States.
“I know what it’s like in countries where people are picked up without charges, and let me tell you: It might start with green card holders, but it does not end there,” she said. “It ratchets up until anyone speaking out against the government is detained without charges. That’s my fear. That’s why I’m speaking out right now.”
Trump appeared top of mind for many of the attendees. Every question Sherrill took from the audience touched on his administration. Residents asked how to deal with fear of the administration, how to protect the state from federal cuts, and how to push back against Trump’s government broadly.
Sherrill said New Jersey should seek to recoup federal funds diverted from congressionally approved spending, bolster civics education to stop democratic backsliding, and stay united to better survive attacks.
“The way this works is if you get picked off one by one, it doesn’t result in us winning. It’s us coming together — that’s the biggest challenge to this administration,” she said.
Sherrill has in recent weeks set her sights on Fulop, accusing him of serving real estate interests over his constituents during his three terms as mayor of New Jersey’s second-largest city. Fulop, in a video he posted last week on social media, said Sherrill’s attacks on him show her campaign is “rightfully” scared of him.
“I’ve seen on the ground over the last month that we’ve been growing fast and I can see the sentiment, and I guess that the political establishment in New Jersey is concerned that our campaign will change New Jersey, and I feel good about that,” he said.
Fulop has said he wants to remake Trenton, aligning himself with about three dozen Assembly candidates, many of whom are running against incumbent Democrats, and offering some of the harshest criticism of the incumbent governor outside of the GOP race. During an interview on ABC 7 over the weekend, Fulop said Murphy has been too cozy with Trump administration officials.
“I think sometimes Governor Murphy is conflict-averse and risk-averse, if you want to be honest about it. And I think that he’s taken a tone with President Trump since he’s been there of somewhat conciliatory, and I think that that’s a mistake because I don’t think President Trump respects people when they’re too kind. I think he respects strength and I think if you have a point you should be assertive on it,” Fulop said.
Gottheimer has made lowering taxes the central plank of his campaign (he promises to lower property taxes by 15%). Gottheimer appeared at a supermarket in an industrial section of Elizabeth last week to tout his support from Latinos who said they’ve already cast their ballots for him, in large part because of his promise to lower taxes.
Gottheimer said that while he believes New Jersey is the best state, there needs to be a sharper focus on making sure people can afford to live here to raise their families and stay here after they retire.
“Our state’s at an inflection point. Our next governor needs to be someone who understands that squeeze families are feeling,” he said. “We’ve got to actually change the way we’re doing things and prioritize lowering taxes and lowering costs for families and making sure we fight to look out for everybody.”
Gottheimer also pointed to the rising cost of utility bills, set to jump 20% next month, and the looming impact of Trump’s tariffs. He said consumers could pay an extra $5,000 annually on goods like clothing and food because of Trump’s economic policies. He said he’s been “leading the charge” to fight back against the tariffs.
“In our great state, we want everyone to have a great education, a great shot, and a safe neighborhood to grow up so their families can do well and they can do well,” he said.
Gottheimer joined Spiller in Newark Saturday to speak to reporters outside Delaney Hall and denounce Baraka’s arrest.
“We’re here right now because it takes every one of us, right?” Spiller said. “We all know that part of being a community is that we can all do different work, we can all fight for the people. But this is an example of if you’re going to come after one of us, you’re going to come after all of us.”

Spiller, like the rest of his Democratic rivals, has used Trump and Trump advisor Elon Musk as punching bags on the campaign trail. He said the pushback against Baraka’s arrest is part of the collective movement among Democrats to push back against “what we’re seeing in D.C.”
“They’re attacking our people. They’re working to divide us,” Spiller said.
Sweeney has leaned heavily on his background as an ironworker, with his allies saying 2025 is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to “put a man of labor” in the New Jersey governor’s seat.
“I’m running against people who went to the Naval Academy, people who went to Harvard, and I went to apprenticeship school. But guess what? My education was on the street. That’s as valuable as any other education you can possibly get,” Sweeney told the International Longshoremen’s Association.
Sweeney was a state senator for nearly 20 years and has used his time in the Legislature to argue that he can get things done in ways his rivals cannot. During a Monday Democratic debate on NJ Spotlight News, he argued that a Christie-era 2% property tax cap that he supported has helped keep property taxes from rising higher than they would have without it.
“What that cap has done has forced towns to start sharing,” he said. “But the 2% property tax cap … cut the property tax from $15,000 to $10,000.”
The GOP primary includes contractor Justin Barbera, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, ex-Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, and former New Jersey 101.5 talk show host Bill Spadea.
Bramnick has separated himself from his rivals by distancing himself from Trump (Bramnick has been a vocal Trump critic) and offering to work with Democrats. During a debate last week hosted by NJ Spotlight News, Bramnick urged his opponents to “show some heart.”
“I’m not a bully pulpit guy, I’m a guy who says, ‘Let’s work with everybody,’” he said. “You don’t treat people with disrespect. That’s not what toughness is.”
Ciattarelli, who is running for governor for the third time this year, told supporters in Manahawkin on Thursday that voters have told him they’re focused on four big issues — affordability, public safety, public education, and overdevelopment — and he believes this will be a change election.
“It’s not just Republicans. I find it wherever I go, all around the state. People are ready for change because Phil Murphy’s policies have failed, and the Democratic hopefuls have all been complicit in that failure,” he said.
Ciattarelli said he wants to freeze property taxes for homeowners once they turn 70 and place a moratorium on home reassessments after improvements. He said he wants to lower the corporate business tax and attract more data centers to the state.
He also urged people to vote for Republican legislative candidates, underscoring the importance of a majority in order to move his goals forward. All 80 state Assembly seats are on the ballot this year (Democrats hold a 52-28 majority in that chamber).
“If you want change, you got to make a change,” he said. “Give us a chance. I guarantee you’re going to like our common sense, conservative approach to governance here in New Jersey, but just give us a chance. I will tell you this opportunity exists.”

In Seaside Heights on Saturday, Spadea took a page from the Trump playbook, riling up a crowd of about 75 supporters in a restaurant off the boardwalk by dreaming up new nicknames for Ciattarelli.
“Jack China-relli — while we have veterans who sleep without a roof over their head or a job to go to on Monday morning, he’s supporting, with your money, funding illegal aliens going to college. Think about that,” Spadea said.
(Ciattarelli once supported legislation to make some undocumented immigrants eligible for in-state college tuition rates.)
Spadea repeated that he intends to overhaul New Jersey’s energy goals and remove political adversaries from the state Board of Education. And he made sure the crowd knew he’s aligned with Trump. 
“Being the only candidate that has a plan to lower energy costs, the only candidate that has a solid plan to lower real estate taxes, the only candidate that’s got an actual plan to make our streets safer and our government more affordable — I feel fantastic,” Spadea said. 
Spadea was joined by Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser who twice pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI about his conversations with a Russian diplomat (Trump pardoned Flynn in 2020). Flynn elicited massive cheers from the crowd when he talked about needing more “legal citizens” to vote in June. After the rally, people lined up to take photos with Flynn.
Spadea’s appearance with Flynn was part of a push to woo Trump voters, an effort that may have been dealt a fatal blow on Monday when Trump himself endorsed Ciattarelli, calling Ciattarelli “the best positioned to STAND TALL against the Radical Left Democrats.”
“Jack Ciattarelli is a WINNER, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement,” Trump said on social media.

(Getty Images)The Louisiana Senate advanced a bill Monday that would create an individual income tax credit for homeowners who install a fortified roof. 
Senate Bill 28, sponsored by Sen. Kirk Talbot, R-River Ridge, cleared the chamber in a unanimous vote. 
The measure would give homeowners a nonrefundable income tax credit for up to $10,000 for out-of-pocket expenses used to pay for a fortified roof. 
Fortified roofs are built with improved techniques and materials designed to prevent leaks and withstand hurricane-force winds, lowering the risk of storm damage and typically lowering homeowner insurance rates. The Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) set standards for the products and materials used,
The Louisiana Department of Insurance began its Fortify Homes Program about two years ago, offering grants of up to $10,000 to homeowners who want to upgrade their roofs and can cover any costs in excess of that amount. 
A homeowner who receives a fortified roof grant from the insurance department would also be able to claim the tax credit but only for amounts the grant does not cover. The median cost of a fortified roof in Louisiana is about $16,229.
Combined, the grant and the tax credit could allow more Louisiana homeowners to invest in fortified roofs, which could reduce the cost of property insurance. Louisiana Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack reviewed the Fortify Homes Program recently and found that roofs built through the grant program directly reduced homeowners’ insurance costs at a median rate of 22%.
The state’s Fortify Homes program is in its third year of existence and has awarded more than 1,800 grants since its first round of funding in October 2023. Many more homeowners have opted to upgrade their roofs without grant money. As of Feb. 1, the IBHS had issued 5,413 fortified certificates to property owners in Louisiana, according to the auditor’s report.
Talbot’s proposal limits the total amount of credits the state may issue in a single fiscal year to $10 million, and they are to be issued on a first-come, first-served basis. 
The bill next heads to the House for consideration.

But a sketchy economic outlook and accompanying reduced state revenue estimates means a funding source to implement the program  might have to wait.
Assembly Bill 104 would establish the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program, which would allow willing landowners to sell their water rights back to the state through the year 2035. The bill would direct the state engineer to permanently retire those rights from future allocation to address Nevada’s dwindling groundwater supply.
Last week, the Senate Committee on Natural Resources heard the bill, which will need to pass through the committee by Friday to move forward. The bill passed the Assembly unanimously last month.
Legislation to create a voluntary water rights retirement program was first introduced in 2023 by former Republican Sen. Pete Goicoechea, but stalled in the Legislature. 
For more than a year, lawmakers, conservation groups, mining interests and local water managers worked together to craft the bill’s language and ensure its passage, an effort reflected by the bill’s bipartisan passage in the Assembly and wide support.
“Establishing a water rights retirement program in statute would be simply a step forward in our state in addressing over-appropriation and over pumping,” said Democratic Assemblymember. Natha Anderson of Sparks, who chairs the Assembly Natural Resources Committee and presented the bill to the Senate panel last week.
During the hearing, representatives from several rural counties spoke in support of the measure, including officials in Washoe, Humboldt, Eureka, and Churchill counties.
“It’s a really, very well thought out bill that has lots of support, and we just appreciate that this bill is before your committee,” said Jeff Fontaine, representing the Central Nevada Regional Water Authority and Humboldt River Basin Water Authority.
Several conservation groups also spoke in support of the legislation, including the Great Basin Water Network, the Walker Basin Conservancy, the Nevada Conservation League, and the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition.
Assembly Bill 104 builds on a pilot program launched in 2023 that used a one-time allocation of $25 million in federal funds to purchase groundwater rights from private Nevada landowners in over-pumped and over-appropriated basins. 
More than 22,500 acre-feet of groundwater were retired under the pilot program — enough to cover annual water usage for about 45,000 homes — at an average cost of just over $1,000 per acre-foot.
The pilot program proved more successful than anticipated, attracting offers from water rights holders to sell a total of $65.5 million in rights in a matter of months — about $40 million more than available funding.
Despite wide support, the establishment of the voluntary water rights retirement program has faced some difficulties during this year’s legislative session. 
One drawback discussed during the hearing was the lack of any funding to implement the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program, if passed.
A bill with similar language was introduced in the Assembly, but faced challenges due to the addition of a fiscal note as lawmakers face challenging budget cuts. 
“While we don’t have any money to fill the coffers right now, if we build it, they will come,” said Kyle Roerink, the executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, which was part of the working group that shaped the bill.
“What we are asking you all to do is, let’s build this statutorily. Let’s figure out ways to get the money,” he continued.
The bill authorizes the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to apply for and accept any gift, donation, grant, federal money, or other source of money for the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program. If established, the program would be administered by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
Groundwater is vital in Nevada, where it supplies about 30% of the state’s total water use, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.  In fact, in many rural communities, it’s the primary or sole water source for homes, farms, and ecosystems.
Prior to the 1960s, Nevada experienced relatively minimal development of groundwater sources. Now significantly more groundwater is extracted than is returned to Nevada’s aquifers each year. 
As a result, more than half of Nevada’s 256 groundwater basins are over-appropriated, meaning the volume of water listed in the rights exceeds the amount of actual available water.
A little more than half the groundwater withdrawn is used for agriculture with another 30% used for mining operations.
Mining and farming representatives agreed Nevada’s dwindling groundwater supply is an issue that must be addressed.
During the hearing, Doug Busselman, the executive vice president of the Nevada Farm Bureau, spoke in support of the bill. The Nevada Farm Bureau was part of the working group that helped develop the bill.
“Nevada Farm Bureau also has a policy which supports a voluntary purchase of water and retirement to bring basins back into balance,” Busselman said. 
The Nevada Mining Association was also heavily involved in the creation of the bill, and helped present the bill during the Senate hearing.
“We all know groundwater is a critical resource in Nevada, and it’s facing pressures like none before, including an increasing population base in Nevada, climate change and the need for reliable and up to date resource information,” said Alan Biaggi, a representative for the Nevada Mining Association.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/groundwater-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-13 08:05:37.753361

This burden is especially devastating because women often enter the system at a significant economic disadvantage, making it even harder to navigate and recover from monetary sanctions.
Amber Foster — a commercial truck driver, advocate with Return Strong, and mother of four based in Las Vegas — experienced the financial and psychological burdens of fee debt during her eight year sentence in Nevada.
When Foster was incarcerated, her mother took over primary care of her children, even though she was suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and surviving on SSI benefits. “What many people don’t really understand is that it’s not just the person who is incarcerated, our families are incarcerated with us,” Foster said.
Research shows that when prisons impose fines and fees, it is entire families – specifically women – who pay the price. One study on the fees imposed on incarcerated people across 14 states found that 83% of the family members shouldering these costs were women. Most often, it’s mothers who pay.
These fees are not about accountability—their primary function is to raise revenue. And when you consider the full weight of court debt on incarcerated people and their families, it becomes clear: these monetary sanctions amount to a form of double punishment, compounding the consequences of incarceration long after a sentence has been served. Though often framed as a tool for accountability, in reality, the imposition of fines and fees often extract money from people with no means to pay, driving them further into debt that follows them for years after release.
The burden of court debt falls especially hard on women, particularly mothers. It erodes their sense of identity and the pride that comes from being a provider. “Being a mom to me means being their financial provider and protector. It hurt for me not to be able to be there financially. There was a time when they were homeless and I wasn’t able to help,” said Foster. A study from the Center for American Progress underscores this, finding that almost two-thirds of women, and more than two-thirds of Black women, were either the primary or co-providers for their households.
Even when families are able to send money to their loved ones inside, those funds are often siphoned off for debt repayment. As Foster notes, “let’s say my mom put $100, I would only get $20. They were taking like 80% of it [for restitution, fines, fees, and medical bills], Foster explained. “A couple of times I had to call my uncle because my mom was out of food, because she would send the money to me.”
In Nevada, as in the majority of states across the country, fees imposed on a single person often translates into a decades-long debt sentence for their entire family. A recent national survey on the impacts of fines and fees found that 99% of parents impacted by court debt were forced to cut back on at least one essential need. This translates to 17 million households facing food or housing insecurity or lacking another basic need. For women who are already at socio-economic disadvantage, the burden of court debt is doubly amplified. As Foster noted,“Without all the fines and fees payments, I could have gotten a car, a down payment for an apartment, clothes for my daughter and son, money for my mom,” she added. “It could have done wonders.”
With multiple fee-traps laced throughout the criminal legal system, Nevada is one of the most expensive places to be incarcerated in the U.S. Commissary markups — or fees on items purchased from commissary — once climbed as high as 66%, resulting in massive profits for the state at the expense of families. Thanks to recent reforms, however, markups capped at 35%, meaning families will now see their dollars go further when supporting loved ones. In addition, Nevada passed legislation eliminating markups on hygiene items, room-and-board fees, and medical co-pays, taking an essential step toward protecting the health of incarcerated people and easing the financial load on families.
But we still have work to do. One man released after nearly 15 years in prison received a letter from the Nevada Department of Corrections demanding $7,216.76 in medical debt, payable within 30 days. To meet that demand, one would need to earn $115,000 annually without spending a dollar on basic needs. It’s not just cruel, it’s impossible.
The financial toll is just one part of the story. The emotional and psychological toll is just as crushing. Foster noted how difficult it was to be a mother when your only means of connection to your child is being blocked by fees. “Letters and phone calls were how we stayed connected. There were times I couldn’t call them because I didn’t have money for the phone call fees. The system is made to break you. If you don’t have a strong mindset it will break you.”
Right now, the Nevada Legislature has another opportunity to support mothers and families of people who are currently and formerly incarcerated by passing SB88, which would discharge medical debt upon release from prison, and SB323, which makes a pilot program that allowed 15 minutes of free phone calls for women in the women’ s prisons permanent. Additionally, lawmakers have the chance to pass SB120, which would require judges to offer payment plans, at no cost, for fines and fees and end public defender fees. These critical reforms recognize that incarceration should not come with a lifelong debt sentence that prevents people rebuilding their lives and caring for their children.
Nevada has already demonstrated leadership in eliminating exploitative fees that burden struggling families and hinder successful reintegration. This session, the state has a chance to actively support women like Foster, who have risen above unimaginable trauma and hardship to rebuild their lives and provide for their families.
By continuing to eliminate these court-imposed costs, and passing reforms like SB 88, SB 120, and SB323, Nevada can serve as a model for a compassionate, rehabilitative justice system that puts people first – not profit.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1245003810-scaled-1-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-05-13 08:05:37.753361

(Photo courtesy of Attorney General Alan Wilson's Office)Attorneys general from six states say they’re demanding accountability from WeChat, a Chinese messaging and payment platform being used by fentanyl traffickers.
The bipartisan group is giving WeChat, what’s become known as a super app, a month to detail what steps it’s taking, if any, to combat its use as a money launderer for the international drug trade.
“We need answers; we need them now,” Republican Alan Wilson, South Carolina’s attorney general since 2011, said at a news conference Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Standing beside him was North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat.
A letter dated Monday instructs WeChat to send answers by June 11 to the attorneys general in North Carolina and New Jersey, two states where “knowingly facilitating, or aiding and abetting, money laundering” is a crime.
“WeChat’s contribution to the devastating fentanyl crisis endangers the life and health of our people,” they wrote in the letter, also signed by attorneys general from Colorado, Mississippi, and New Hampshire.
If WeChat fails to respond, lawsuits from the states’ chief prosecutors could follow, as well as advocacy for laws and regulations, Wilson and Jakson said.
WeChat is one of the world’s most popular messaging apps with more than a billion users globally, including a million-plus in the United States. The app created by the company Tencent allows encrypted messaging and payments to be made within it — two features that have made it incredibly popular for criminal activity, according to prosecutors.
The app has been linked to major drug operations.
In October 2023, the Drug Enforcement Agency announced indictments against eight Chinese companies and 12 people in a bust dubbed Operation Chem Capture. They were accused of importing the chemicals used to make fentanyl — called fentanyl precursors — as well as other drugs such as xylazine that are mixed with fentanyl to increase cartels’ profits.
The multi-agency operation seized enough synthetic chemicals to make more than 48 million potentially lethal doses, the agency’s administrator, Anne Milgram, said in a statement submitted to the U.S. House last May.
“Operation Chem Capture once again showed that these synthetic chemicals are cheap — a deadly dose costs mere cents — and sold online on public websites and through encrypted applications like WhatsApp, WeChat, and Wickr,” the statement read.
Jackson illustrated a three-step process for how Chinese brokers and drug cartels use WeChat to partner for fentanyl dealing.
Chinese companies sell the chemical ingredients to the cartels, who make the fentanyl. The drug is then smuggled into the country and sold for cash. In the final step, the cash is given to Chinese brokers who use WeChat to give the money back to the cartel, he said.
“We estimate that we are talking about billions of dollars per year,” Jackson said.
The joint letter, which uses Jackson’s letterhead, is addressed to WeChat’s registered agent in Delaware.
People “are using the internet to evolve how they launder money, to evolve how they evade detection by law enforcement, to evolve how they promote this type of illicit activity,” Wilson said. “So, we have to evolve with them.”
Wilson told reporters the fentanyl epidemic is the top issue that keeps him up at night.
In South Carolina, overdose deaths have soared from 613 in 2013 to 2,296 in 2022, according to the most recent statistics from the state Department of Public Health. That represents a near-quadrupling over that decade.
Fentanyl accounted for more than 70% of those 2022 deaths, or 1,660 overdoses, representing a near-quadrupling over just five years, according to the 2024 report.
“Everybody knows someone, either personally or within one or two degrees of separation, where a family has lost a young person or someone has died as an overdose as a result of the illicit fentanyl trafficking going on in our respective states,” Wilson said.
Last month, three men — two from Sumter and one from Georgia — were indicted in South Carolina in what federal prosecutors called one of the largest international, drug-related money laundering operations the Palmetto State’s ever seen.
They’re accused by the U.S. Department of Justice of laundering more than $30 million in the trafficking of fentanyl and other drugs, as well as taking cash from two Mexican cartels and using it to purchase and ship electronics to Hong Kong, China and the United Arab Emirates to be sold for profit.
SC men indicted in $30M money laundering scheme tied to Mexican drug traffickers

WeChat played a crucial role in the alleged criminal dealings, the Wilson’s office noted in a news release Monday.
“WeChat has become a digital safe haven for fentanyl traffickers and money launderers, and they know it,” said Wilson.
Last week, the Legislature passed a law creating the charge of fentanyl induced homicide. Following Gov. Henry McMaster’s expected signature, anyone who provides the fentanyl that causes a fatal overdose can be charged with homicide and sent to prison for up to 30 years.
That came two years after a law threatened fentanyl trackers with up to 40 years in prison.
Wilson said he’s working on “getting the most stringent and aggressive laws passed that we possibly can go after fentanyl trafficking and illicit money laundering that supports it.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/86E8A89C-14F2-49F0-9E43-9914BCD25BF5remote428533b2de1c4cf0b2b3878bc5d3d74707b2cf8c-2-original-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-13 08:05:37.753361

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Hannah King: The $15-million case for legal aid in Vermont.","This commentary is by Hannah King of Burlington. She is executive director of the Vermont Bar Foundation and a former Burlington city councilor.When we talk about access to justice, we are talking about something foundational to democracy: the idea that everyone, regardless of income, status or circumstance, should be able to understand and exercise their rights under the law. At the Vermont Bar Foundation, we fund legal services that make this promise real for thousands of Vermonters each year. And as new data from Vermont Law and Graduate School makes clear, the economic return on this investment is not just powerful — it’s transformative. VLGS’s latest report on the economic impact of its pro bono legal clinics reveals something Vermonters can be proud of: over $15 million in Vermont-centric economic benefit generated from just $1.36 million in Vermont-focused operating budgets. That’s an astonishing return of $11 for every $1 invested, all by providing no-cost legal services to those who need them most. These clinics aren’t hypothetical. They are lifelines. Vermont Law and Graduate School is not just a hub for legal education — it’s a vital partner in the state’s justice ecosystem. By embedding students in hands-on legal clinics, VLGS equips future lawyers with real-world skills while directly serving Vermonters in need.Its unique focus on public interest law and community impact sets a national example and reflects Vermont’s values of fairness, equity, and innovation. Investing in VLGS is investing in a pipeline of legal professionals who are deeply committed to justice, sustainability and rural advocacy — priorities that define our state and its future.  In South Royalton, legal advocates have supported over 700 veterans since the inception of the program in 2014, and 200 client families each year — including domestic violence survivors and children – resulting in more than $6.3 million in impact.  The Small Business Law Clinic, in collaboration with Vermont Legal Aid and the Vermont Bar Association, helped nearly 300 small businesses, many of them recovering from catastrophic floods, creating over $3.1 million in economic benefit. Clinics focused on food justice, immigration, environmental health and renewable energy are improving lives while strengthening communities across every Vermont county. This work is not possible without the generosity of donors and the strategic vision of our partners, including the Vermont Supreme Court, which commissioned the original economic impact study this work builds upon.As the executive director of the Vermont Bar Foundation, I see daily how these efforts ripple outward — stabilizing families, empowering small business owners, protecting vulnerable populations and training the next generation of legal professionals to lead with compassion and purpose. Legal aid isn’t charity. It’s infrastructure. It’s public safety. It’s economic development. It’s justice.At a time when trust in institutions is being tested and the rule of law must be fiercely defended, Vermont’s commitment to legal access is more than a moral imperative — it’s an economic engine. Let’s continue to fund it, expand it and celebrate it. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Hannah King: The $15-million case for legal aid in Vermont.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-13 08:05:37.753361

(Courtesy of the Office of Secretary of State)Secretary of State Steve Hobbs is preparing to lay off nearly 50 Washington State Library employees due to a decline in state and federal funding.
In the past two weeks, 47 workers at the main library in Tumwater and at the Washington Talking Book & Braille Library in Seattle learned they are at-risk of losing their jobs, some in June and others in September, because of the lack of resources, Hobbs announced Monday.
“It is heartbreaking and distressing to witness the near elimination of our state’s Central Library, which has existed since territorial times to enrich our culture and serve as a research hub for our state’s residents,” Hobbs said in a statement.
Staff in 27 state-funded positions received a layoff date of June 30 while those in 20 federally funded positions have a Sept. 30 date. 
Hobbs warned of potentially far-reaching repercussions.

Operating hours of the main state library in Tumwater will be trimmed and it may be closed entirely to the public, curbing access to its trove of historical and governmental collections.
In addition, the Ask A Librarian program that receives thousands of calls each year could go unanswered, and email inquiries will not receive timely responses. Additionally, subscriptions to newspaper and genealogy databases will be discontinued, and the acquisition of new materials will be drastically limited, said deputy secretary of state Randy Bolerjack.
Similarly, the Talking Book and Braille Library may be closed to the public with phone support reduced and circulation and registration services slowed. Production of braille and audio materials could also be reduced or suspended at the state’s only accessible library service for people who are blind or have other disabilities.
Fiscal challenges are playing out on two fronts.
At the state level, the library system continues to suffer from a sluggish housing market that’s generated less revenues from fees paid on real estate transactions. A portion of this fee revenue goes to support the library. 
The secretary of state’s office requested $6.7 million for the next budget to make up for lower-than-expected receipts and maintain current service levels. While House and Senate budgets contained a smaller sum — $2.7 million in the House and $1.2 million in the Senate — there was no money in the final budget passed by the Legislature, Bolerjack said.
Those dollars were counted on to fund 15 jobs in the library in Tumwater and 12 positions at the Talking Book and Braille Library.
A thin silver lining looms.
A bill awaiting action by Gov. Bob Ferguson would impose a new $50 surcharge on all filings handled by Superior Court clerks, of which $20 would go to the secretary of state’s office for the library, archives and state legacy projects. This would generate up to $6 million in a full biennium, according to a fiscal analysis.
So while there will be job cuts, hopefully, if the legislation is signed, some of those laid off can be hired back, Bolerjack said.
Meanwhile, the federal government informed the state April 2 that it had terminated a grant that paid for 20 positions. Then last week, the federal government rescinded the termination and will be providing $3.9 million, Bolerjack said.
Those employees still face layoffs because there is no indication whether the grant funding will be continued after Sept. 30, he added.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/6265035794_1844eba4dc_o.jpg,,,2025-05-13 08:05:37.753361

Read the competing commentary here. 
Our state net metering policy is what allows Minnesotans to install solar and be power producers, not just power consumers. Net metering requires that solar owners be fairly credited by the electric utility when the owner delivers solar power to the grid. 
But the first goal of a monopoly is to maintain their monopoly. This is why monopoly power utilities are constantly trying to weaken net metering. They want to be the only option when it comes to delivering power.  
The concept of net metering is fair and simple. Power produced by a small solar array — defined in state law as an array under 40 kW — is first consumed by the homeowner, small business or farmer who installed it. If there is any power they can’t use, it goes to the grid, flowing to nearby power users. The utility charges the user for that power even though the utility did not produce it. The utility then credits the solar owner who produced the power that same amount. For the utility, this is an economic wash — the credit is equal to the income the utility generates for charging for the solar owner’s power. 
Net metering is key to advancing small-scale solar, which benefits us all. 
First, it quickly adds renewable solar power to our energy mix. With the demand for electrical energy surging as more of our cars and appliances become electric, we need all the renewable energy we can get as soon as we can get it. Rooftop solar goes up in weeks, as opposed to utility scale solar — which takes years. Second, producing power closest to where it is used is most efficient. There is almost no line loss with rooftop solar, and it reduces the need for large transmission lines. Third, it allows Minnesotans to take control of their energy costs and become energy producers, not just consumers. 
Representatives of Minnesota’s rural electric cooperatives and municipal power companies are proposing state legislation to gut net metering. They propose that when a solar owner shares electricity with the neighbor, a rural electric cooperative or municipal utility can still charge the neighbor full retail price, but for any credits the solar customer has at the end of the year, they will compensate them a small fraction of that. And rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities already can and do charge solar access fees just for having solar. They want to keep charging solar owners a fee for having solar and pay them a dramatically reduced rate for solar they deliver to the grid. 
I can see why they would want this change. I can’t see how they can claim it is fair.
Opponents of net metering like to bring up California, but that comparison actually makes the case for Minnesota keeping our current policy. 
California had such a successful net metering policy that they reached 2 million rooftop solar arrays (versus fewer than 25,000 in Minnesota) which by one analysis has saved utility customers as much as $1.5 billion in 2024 alone. But utilities succeeded in dramatically weakening California’s net metering law by pushing a cost shift myth. As a result, the adoption of solar slowed and thousands of solar jobs were lost. (For a deep dive on this issue go to the Solar Rights Alliance website.) That isn’t what we want here in Minnesota. 
Solar United Neighbors is a non-profit that works with folks throughout the state to help them go solar. The majority of people we work with are middle or lower income and small businesses looking to control energy costs and be a part of a carbon-free energy future. This is also what the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory reports from their 2024 report on the income of solar adopters: “Roughly 49% of solar adopters in 2023 had incomes below 120% of their area median income, a threshold sometimes used to define ‘low-and-moderate income,’ while 26% were below 80% of AMI, often used to define ‘low-income.’” It’s a myth that solar adopters are only wealthy. In fact, solar is a key way that middle and lower income folks can take control of their energy costs.  
Solar is still emerging and growing in Minnesota, especially in rural areas. The overwhelming majority of utilities in Minnesota have solar penetration that is less than 1% of customers with fewer than 500 small solar arrays in their service area. Changing our net metering policy now would reduce solar adoption dramatically just when it is most needed. 
Decentralizing and democratizing our energy production may threaten monopoly utilities, but it is clearly in the public interest and we should be proud that Minnesota has a simple and fair net metering policy that is making this possible.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-129260624.jpg,,,2025-05-13 08:05:37.753361

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Elizabeth Frascoia: Arts education produces creative leaders.","This commentary is by Elizabeth Frascoia of Taftsville. She is the executive director of the Governor’s Institutes of Vermont and a professional musician.On the night of May 2, the Governor’s Institutes of Vermont received an email identical to many across the state and country: the National Endowment for the Arts had rescinded its offer to fund us. After a decade of steady funding, the $30,000 to support this summer’s Governor’s Institute on the Arts is gone with the click of a button as federal priorities change.The funding may be gone, but the 190 accepted high school students from every corner of Vermont are very much still here. They are telling us that they crave connection with peers and inspiration from professional artists. Their recommenders are telling us that arts opportunities in their home communities are limited. And their parents and guardians are telling us that without significant financial aid, they cannot afford this transformational experience for their children.The Arts Institute is a two-week immersive learning experience for Vermont high schoolers, which helps them form a community with peers and professional artists, shows them career opportunities and introduces them to college life. Students tell us it changes their lives and helps them find belonging and confidence, critical to good mental health and the desire to contribute to our communities. GIV is committed to a sliding-scale tuition model based on family income, to ensure that any young person with motivation and passion can access our summer Institutes. Students can pay as little as $20 to attend a two-week institute on Vermont State University’s Castleton campus.This model depends on community support — the proverbial “it takes a village” is alive and well. We are grateful for the 20% of our funding which comes from the state. Combined with contributions from dozens of generous businesses and foundations, and hundreds of individuals, we all come together to make this possible. So when a steady funding source like the NEA evaporates overnight, we must scramble to find other generous folks who can step up to invest in these students.These young folks will not be students for long: soon they will be Vermont’s leaders. And I know I want to live in a place where our leaders have the resilience and creativity that studying the arts brings.Arts education isn’t extra — it’s essential. It helps people learn to approach a problem from multiple perspectives. To listen thoughtfully and think critically. And to understand one another, listening to other points of view while seeing the human behind the argument. This builds flexible thinkers who can imagine new possibilities — which Vermont needs more than ever.Our state has many challenges right now, from an aging population to a housing crisis to our newfound propensity for floods. I want to be a part of inspiring people to be creative citizens, ready to lead Vermont into what surely will be even more challenging times.This is not just about the young person who wants to become a painter or a musician — though these folks are critical to Vermont’s economy. Did you know that, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Vermont’s arts and culture sector brings in more than $1.2 billion annually for the state? Arts students also go on to be business owners, engineers, bankers and local leaders. All of these young people are our future and they need us to advocate for them.I urge you to speak up for how essential the arts are to our state, and to be a voice for the power of arts education to produce creative leaders. Our students need your voice.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Elizabeth Frascoia: Arts education produces creative leaders.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-13 08:05:37.753361

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Editor’s note: The Reformer is publishing dual commentaries as Minnesota lawmakers consider changes to the state’s net metering law. Read the competing commentary here.
As Minnesota continues its clean energy transition, the policies guiding it must be rooted in fairness, sound economics and the realities of how our electric grid operates. Unfortunately, some recent arguments against reforming Minnesota’s outdated net metering laws rely more on ideology than understanding — and risk harming the very communities we all want to support.
First let me explain what net metering is and why it’s become so controversial. Net metering — instituted in the 1980s — allows owners of rooftop solar systems to get credit for the excess electricity they send back to the grid. That credit is given at the full retail rate — the same rate other consumers pay for power that includes not just energy, but the cost of delivering it: the poles, wires, substations and 24/7 reliability.
Imagine a customer selling produce to their local grocery store at the same price they see on the shelf. No grocery store would survive without any margin to pay for employees, maintenance, taxes, etc. and neither can a not-for-profit electric cooperative. We understand in the short term the deal is great for the produce-selling customer, but in the long run, it will hurt the entire community when the grocery store is forced to close or raise prices.
This isn’t about opposing solar. The electric cooperatives and municipal utilities pushing for pragmatic net metering reform support solar power and consumer choice. We are not-for-profit, democratically elected utilities that exist to serve our member-owners — not outside shareholders. But when disproportionately wealthy rooftop solar owners are paid above-market rates for the energy they don’t use themselves, those costs don’t disappear. Those costs are shifted, or paid by everyone else, including families who can’t afford solar panels or who rent their homes.
Furthermore, utility-scale solar is being built at a rapid pace because it’s more efficient and less expensive than rooftop solar. Larger, more strategically placed solar power will do much more to help Minnesota’s clean energy transition than expensive decentralized generation. We’re doing our part to achieve the state’s mandated carbon-free by 2040 goal, but we have an obligation to our member-owners to meet this target in the most efficient, cost-effective manner possible.
Some in the for-profit solar industry deny that this cost shift exists or argue it’s too small to matter. But the reality in rural Minnesota tells a different story. One small electric cooperative recently encountered a situation where a solar developer proposed a large system whose retail credit for power produced would exceed more than 10% of the cooperative’s annual operating margin. That’s money intended to reduce electricity bills and maintain reliable service for all members — not a windfall for developers looking to exploit policy gaps.
This is exactly why Minnesota’s net metering law needs reform. The policy was written in the 1980s, when solar was expensive and rare. Today, we’re proposing a simple, balanced and bipartisan update: Homeowners would still receive full retail credit for the solar energy they use themselves. But when they export excess electricity to the grid, that portion would be credited at a fair, market-based rate — one that reflects the actual value of that power to the grid, not an inflated retail price.
It’s a targeted fix that ensures solar owners are fairly compensated, without shifting unnecessary costs onto their neighbors. It doesn’t eliminate net metering; it modernizes it. Furthermore, when solar systems are sized appropriately for a home’s needs, it leaves more room on the grid for additional installations and benefits more consumers.
Critics have tried to paint this reform as an attack on solar or a cash grab by utilities. That’s simply untrue. Again, cooperatives and municipal utilities are not-for-profit — our mission is affordability and reliability for the communities we serve. The modest grid access fees we sometimes charge help recover the basic costs of safely connecting solar systems to the grid, but they don’t begin to cover the ongoing financial imbalance created by outdated net metering laws.
It’s imperative we act now to modernize this outdated policy and minimize disruptions to Minnesota’s existing solar industry. We understand that for-profit solar developers are concerned about how these changes might affect their bottom line. But by addressing these issues today, we can avoid the kind of drastic measures seen in states like California — where billions in regressive cost shifts prompted aggressive action.
We share a genuine passion for solar and want to work alongside reputable developers to strengthen the grid. But passion cannot justify policies that leave others to foot the bill. Instead, let’s create a fair system where consumer-owned, not-for-profit utilities and solar developers can work together to deliver a clean, affordable and reliable energy future for everyone.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/solarwind2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-13 08:05:37.753361

Adding diverse energy resources to Indiana’s grid increases reliability, decreases consumer costs, creates jobs, and has the potential to foster massive economic growth — to the tune of $565.7 million annually. 
That is why, in 2022, the federal government created this set of tax credits to incentivize the development of clean energy infrastructure and technologies. In the first two years, $9 billion has been invested in projects across Indiana. An added $20 billion in outstanding investment for projects has been announced but not implemented. Through these tax credits, Indiana has expanded the sector and fostered economic growth to the benefit of all Hoosiers, and there should be more to come. 
A new study commissioned by The Nature Conservancy shows that between now and 2032, these credits will annually generate $300.8 million through household income, $59.3 million in local, state, and federal tax revenue, and support 6,300 jobs. Further, these benefits are not isolated to only one industry but span construction, manufacturing, professional services, and the supply chain.
Despite the incredible results and the promise for future growth, these tax credits are at risk of being eliminated. The current budget talks make tax credits an easy target for federal cuts looking to reduce the debt fast. In response, 21 Republican members of the House of Representatives signed a letter showing their support for these credits. But this may not be enough to save them from being cut. That is why we urge the entire Indiana Congressional delegation to use their influence while serving on key committees to protect this potential growth engine for our state. 
We can keep Indiana competitive in the national market and support local businesses. However, we must take full advantage of all the available tools, including clean energy tax credits. As the new administration works to encourage industries to return to the U.S., it is imperative to keep Indiana a desirable environment to retain and attract strong economic potential. Indiana, with its clear advantage due to a diverse energy portfolio—both in infrastructure and land—is set to benefit. 
Hoosier businesses make decisions based on economic potential. The clean energy tax credits offer a proven way to foster economic growth, bolster manufacturing, lower energy costs, and attract more companies to Indiana—all while diversifying energy sources and promoting clean energy. More clean energy also means cleaner air and water—outcomes that improve Hoosier’s quality of life, the local environment, and people’s health. 
Our elected officials should work to foster economic growth, provide jobs, and lower energy costs, that’s arguably why the people chose them to stand for Hoosiers in Washington.

For many Missourians, especially in rural or low-income areas, public radio and television are far more than entertainment. They’re essential services. Now, those services are under threat.


The Trump administration has proposed eliminating all federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting(CPB), which supports NPR, PBS, and hundreds of local stations across the country. This $1.1 billion cut would gut the infrastructure of public media, leaving many stations without the resources to continue serving their communities. If Congress approves, we are cutting off vital access to information for people who need it most.


Here in Missouri, we know the value of public broadcasting. In towns where broadband access is limited and local newspapers have shuttered, NPR affiliates are often the last remaining source of reliable news. For families navigating a fractured education system, PBS Kids programming offers a free and trusted learning tool. And for communities of color, immigrant populations, and other marginalized groups, public media has offered a rare platform to tell our stories and hear others like them.


I know the power of public broadcasting firsthand. In 2010, I was an intern at Nine PBS in St. Louis, where I saw how dedicated teams work tirelessly to deliver educational and cultural programming that reflects and serves our local communities. That experience continues to inform my belief in the role public media plays in strengthening democracy.


What’s most frustrating about this proposal is that it’s not taking place in isolation. At the same time that public broadcasting is vulnerable to losing needed funding, the federal budget for the Pentagon is on track to exceed $1 trillion. While billions are poured into weapons systems and defense contractors, pennies are being pinched from programs that inform, educate and unify.


At the Peace Economy Project, we advocate for a reallocation of public funds away from militarism and toward programs that strengthen our communities. That includes healthcare, education, climate resilience — and yes, public media.
When we spend more on missiles than on minds, we undermine both our security and our democracy.


Public broadcasting has proven to be one of the most cost-effective investments our government makes. The CPB costs each American about $1.35 per year. For the price of a candy bar, we receive educational programming, local journalism, cultural enrichment, and civic discourse. These are the building blocks of a healthy democracy. They are not luxuries.


Cutting federal funding would also disproportionately harm stations in rural and underserved communities. Unlike urban stations that can supplement their budgets with corporate sponsorship and philanthropy, many small stations rely heavily on federal support. Without it, they may be forced to shut down or dramatically cut services. That means fewer local voices on the airwaves, fewer educational programs for kids, and less access to emergency information when it’s needed most.


Defunding public broadcasting is shortsighted and dangerous. It weakens the flow of fact-based journalism at a time when disinformation is surging. It disconnects communities already struggling with isolation, and it sends a clear message that the voices of everyday Americans matter less than the interests of weapons manufacturers.


This administration would lead people to believe that public safety is about border walls and military bases. It’s actually more about social programs and access to reliable information, early childhood education, cultural expression, and civic participation. Public broadcasting supports all of these.


I urge Missouri’s congressional delegation—Democrats and Republicans alike—to reject this proposal. Stand up for the farmers tuning into Harvest Public Media. Stand up for the kids watching Mister Rogers reruns in the far reaches of the heartland. Stand up for the voters who depend on unbiased election coverage, and for the storytellers who bring our region’s history and hopes to life.

(Photo by Mitch Perry Florida Phoenix)Although he’s already been endorsed by Donald Trump for governor, Southwest Florida Republican U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds is just now beginning to introduce himself to Floridians who don’t know much more about him other than his ubiquitous appearances on cable news over the past few years.
Speaking on the back of a small flatbed truck outside of Conservative Grounds, the MAGA-flavored coffee shop in Pinellas County on Saturday afternoon, Donalds was intent on responding to a criticism voiced by Ron DeSantis earlier this year that he “hasn’t been part of any of the victories” that Republicans have enjoyed in Florida in recent years.
“A lot’s been made about what I’ve been doing the last couple of years,” Donalds acknowledged about halfway through his 22-minute speech. He said the choice before him a year ago was whether he should stay in Florida and work for GOP candidates or “do I go on the road with Donald Trump and campaign to make sure that we save the United States of America?”
He said that, after conferring with his wife Erika and his team, he went all in for Trump.
“I told the president and I told his campaign, I said, ‘Listen: You can have the entire calendar. Just take it. It’s yours,” he said.
“Because Florida is wonderful. We have leadership that has protected this state.  Gov DeSantis is to be commended for that. He’s done a tremendous job. But the fight this last November was not in Florida. The fight was across America. And so it didn’t matter where the liberals were, that’s where I was. If they were in Detroit, I was there. If they were in Philadelphia, I was there.”
Donalds, 46, is a Brooklyn native who moved to Florida to attend Florida State University, where he graduated in 2002 before beginning a career in banking, finance, and insurance, according to the biography listed on his congressional website. He got involved in politics in 2010, the year of the Tea Party, which led to his first run for Congress in 2012 (when he lost in a Republican primary in Congressional District 19 to Trey Radel).
He was elected to the state House representing all of Hendry and a part of Collier County in 2016 and was re-elected in 2018. In 2020, he opted to run for Congress in Florida’s 19th District in Southwest Florida after GOP incumbent Francis Rooney announced he was resigning. He narrowly defeated fellow Republican Dane Eagle in a nine-person GOP primary in 2020, and has been re-elected to that seat twice since.
Few details
In speaking about his plans if elected governor in 2026, Donalds touched on a variety of subjects without delving too deeply.
The property insurance situation? “We’re going to fix it once and for all.”
Transportation? “We’re going to continue the work from Gov. DeSantis. We’re going to expand these roads. We’re going to make it easier for people to move through, not just here in Clearwater, not just here in Pinellas, but all through Florida. We’re going to make it clear for everybody.”
The economy? “We’re going to make sure that our economy is the number one economy in the entire [nation],” he said. “We’re going to have more businesses coming here employing more people.”
Donalds is the only major declared Republican candidate in the race, although how long that remains the case remains to be seen here in the spring of 2025.
First Lady Casey DeSantis has kept the idea alive that she might enter the race. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez says he is still considering getting into the contest. Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson was reportedly considering his own bid, although that was before Trump stepped in and endorsed Donalds (before the congressman himself had officially announced).
Early polls show that the Trump endorsement is a big deal for Donalds.
As Donalds begins his campaign, Florida’s top Republicans are in disarray, with a tentative budget deal between the state House and Senate now off the table, according to state legislative leaders in comments made on Friday.
Donalds assured the audience that “they’re going to figure this out, I promise you that.”
No RINOs
He added that “there will be no RINO (Republicans in Name Only) activity in Tallahasee,” drawing large cheers. “None of that is going to occur.”
He dismissed Democrats, inaccurately claiming that they have now grown so low that they’re behind registered independents in the state.
“We are going to make sure that the Democrats stay exactly as they are in the state of Florida. And that’s not number two, it’s number three,” he said. “Because there are actually more independents than Democrats now.”
As of April 30, the Florida Division of Elections website shows that there are 5.5 million people registered as Republicans and 4.32 million registered Democrats in the state, with 3.58 million registered as No Party Affiliation. Another 425,882 are listed as registered with minor parties.
Donalds was introduced to the crowd by his wife, Erika, a former member of the Collier County School Board who now serves as the chair of the Florida state chapter of the America First Policy Institute. She described the Tea Party movement that they joined.
“We got angry at what we saw the government doing, making decisions that were ruining our economy, bailing out people and companies that didn’t deserve it, while we were working our butts off to pay all of our bills and do things the right way. That’s what got us involved in politics,” she said.

Bob Ferguson’s signature. 
Washington created the Abortion Access Project following the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling, which guaranteed the right to an abortion. While the court’s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson cleared the way for states to restrict or largely ban abortion, Washington is one of the states where reproductive care is more accessible. 
The pending $8.5 million cut could mean reduced hours and staffing cuts at clinics and less security for patients seeking care, advocates say. 
The state Legislature previously allocated $15 million in the 2023-25 budget to support clinics providing care.
“With less dollars, we’re going to be able to provide abortion care for less patients,” said Jennifer M. Allen, CEO of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates.
The group described the reduction as “devastating” at a time when other states around the country have adopted more restrictive abortion laws. 
“To our knowledge, it is the only cut to abortion funding in state history,” Allen said. “Our state has never before gone backwards on access to abortion.”
Since the Dobbs decision, abortion restrictions in other states are causing a growing demand for reproductive health services in states like Washington. 
“This loss of care will further burden our already overburdened clinics and put patient lives at risk,” said Sami Alloy, executive director of Pro-Choice Washington. “It will lead to more emergency complications and more burden on our emergency health care system at a time when access to care is already under attack.”
From 2021 to 2022, there was a 17% increase in abortions provided to Washington residents and a 45% increase in abortions provided to non-residents, according to the state’s Department of Health. Washington’s neighboring state, Idaho, has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. 
Funding for the Abortion Access Project is used for anyone seeking abortion care, regardless of income or residency status. 
The five abortion care agencies in the state supported by the program provided 80% of the total abortions in 2022, according to the Department of Health’s Center for Health Statistics. These clinics are located in 20 out of the 39 counties in Washington state. 
There are “wide swaths of geography where patients have no care,” Alloy said, and the cuts will harm patients who already face higher barriers to care. Medicaid reimbursement rates for reproductive health services are also lower than for other kinds of health care, she added.  
Allen said Planned Parenthood has been in contact with Ferguson and his team about possibilities for shoring up funding. 
“If there’s no money to fund that actual care for patients, then that right doesn’t mean very much,” Allen said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/planned-parenthood-sign-2025-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-13 08:05:37.753361

The spending on new construction isn’t essential for the day-to-day operations of state government. But failure to pass the bill means 86 projects developed over many months — or in some cases years — must secure other funding, wait a year for another opportunity for state support or be canceled.
Jefferson City was in the bill for $20 million to help a $130 million project for a conference center, hotel and parking garage come to life. That project, developed in detail in 2023, would be funded mainly by bonds secured by revenue from city lodging taxes and the activity it generates, said Luke Holtschneider, executive director of the Jefferson City Regional Economic Partnership.
The project plans will likely be pared back, he said.
“Obviously it came as a bit of a shock, or very much a shock, on Friday,” Hotschneider said in an interview with The Independent. “So we’re still trying to understand from our standpoint, how we envision the future of this project without that.”
 State Rep. Dave Griffith, R-Jefferson City (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
State Rep. David Griffith, a Jefferson City Republican, noted that his community lost other projects as well, including $15 million to preserve the Missouri State Penitentiary structures and $4 million for a juvenile detention center.
But Griffith supports the House’s decision. 
“I can tell you that we all lost,” Griffith said. “Everybody on our side of the aisle, everybody in the House, lost projects. We lost projects that were important to all of us.”
When the Senate took up a House bill being handled by state Sen. David Gregory, a Chesterfield Republican, the reverberations began — Senate Appropriations Chairman Lincoln Hough rose to say he did not intend to let any House bills pass.
And, Hough made clear, he had called Gregory to tell him before going to the floor.
“I wanted everyone to understand the openness in which you and I talked about what was getting ready to happen today based on the activities or really, I guess you can see the inactivity of our counterparts on the other side last week,” Hough said.
Hough then spent the next two hours going through the spending measure, line by line, calling colleagues to the floor to discuss projects in their district that would not be funded.
And, he said after Gregory set the bill aside two hours later, he will continue at the next opportunity.
“It’s important to itemize what is lost now, due to just the inaction of the House last week,” Hough said.
Some of the projects not funded include:

$50 million to support the University of Missouri’s project to build a new research reactor. 
$55 million for a new livestock display and stalling barn at the Missouri State Fairgrounds.
$40 million for health care projects in amounts ranging from $750,000 to $10 million in St. Louis, Lee’s Summit, Barry County, Springfield, Kansas City, Joplin, Clinton, Butler, Salem, St. Joseph, Pineville, Sullivan County, Scotland County and Pemiscot County.

The result of the House inaction, Hough said, is more precarious access to health care in rural areas, slower action on crime evidence at state laboratories and higher costs for residents in areas where projects go ahead.
In Park Hills, $2.5 million was to defray some costs before the city goes to voters in November for a bond issue for replacement of lead water lines, said Zach Franklin, city administrator. It would help reduce the increase in rates needed to pay for the project, he said.
“It shows we were acting in good faith to say to our users we have saved you this much money to date,” Franklin said.
MU spokesman Christopher Ave said the university would “move forward aggressively with fundraising and planning” despite the setback because of the need for the isotopes.
“The importance of NextGen MURR in producing life-saving radioisotopes cannot be overstated,” Ave said. “These radioisotopes have not only extended the lives of Missourians but hundreds of thousands of others around the globe.”
Under questioning from Hough, state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat, noted that the MU Research Reactor is one of the few places in the world producing many of the products.
“I would like to think that when it comes to cancer patients, and cancer research, I would say, ‘you know what, maybe I didn’t get everything I wanted, but I’m going to support that,’” Webber said.
The livestock barn, said state Sen. Rusty Black, a Republican from Chillicothe, is the essential adjunct to a new arena under construction at the fairgrounds.
“Why build a football field at the Arctic Circle if you’re not going to put the locker rooms for people to dress in?” Black said. “And that’s what they’ve done with that facility.”
And when Hough called on state Sen. Karla May, a St. Louis Democrat, to give her take on the House inaction, she said she was still simmering in anger. The action, she said, was like a tantrum.
“When you’re raising kids and you’re a parent, you know how your children get upset and they storm out of a room because they haven’t figured out how to handle their emotions maturely?” May said.
The House response should have been to talk and warn the Senate that there was a limit to what it would accept, she said. But when the state has a healthy fund balance and needs to fill, the money should be spent, she said.
“This is taxpayers’ money,” May said. “Taxpayers’ money is supposed to go back to benefit taxpayers.”

The budget process this year was the most routine in several years in large part because factional fights among state Senate Republicans have been quashed. Like nine of the last 10 years, the House and Senate passed budget plans for state operations, then met in conference committees to iron out differences.
The Senate took up three capital spending bills first thing Friday. Along with the bill with money for new projects, there was a $633 million bill for maintenance projects and a $2.7 billion spending bill to continue projects first authorized two years ago.
Meanwhile, the House was passing the negotiated versions of 13 bills spending $49.8 billion to fund the day-to-day operations of state government in the coming fiscal year.
The House recessed after finishing the operating budget, took up a couple of non-spending bills when members returned and then, after the Senate had adjourned for the week, started voting on the construction bills. Only when the House also adjourned was it clear members would not vote on the bill for new projects.
In a news conference Friday, House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton said the bill was killed because overall spending in the budget had exceeded the amount he set as the ceiling and there had been no time to work out differences.
In Gov. Mike Kehoe’s budget, the bill cost $329.4 million, including $143.8 million in general revenue. When it left the House, it had grown to $401.5 million, with $215.9 million in general revenue. When the Senate approved it, the bill cost $513.1 million and $327.5 million in general revenue.
Unlike the operating budget, in nine of the last 10 years the capital improvements budget passed the Senate too late to arrange a conference committee. In those nine years, the Senate either passed the bill as approved in the House without changes or the House accepted the Senate version in order to meet the constitutional deadline.
The only year a conference committee was appointed, in 2017, no compromise was reached and the bill, which had $63 million in total spending, was not passed.
There was no individual project in the bill for new projects that led to the decision to kill it, said state Rep. Bishop Davidson, a Republican from Republic and vice chairman of the House Budget Committee. Instead, he said, it was the overall cost.
The budget as passed would use $15.8 billion in general revenue. With the bill for new construction, the total would be pushed to $16.1 billion, or about $2.6 billion more than expected revenue. The difference will come from banked surpluses.
Passing the bills as they were revised in the Senate, “would have been definitely on the table this year if it weren’t for the fact that it would have put us in what we saw as a fiscally irresponsible position,” Davidson said.
State Rep. Barry Hovis, a Cape Girardeau Republican, was watching four projects in the construction budget — $750,000 to support a city water project, $7 million for an air traffic control training center for the Southeast Missouri State University aviation program, $12.7 million for a new crime lab for Troop E of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and $20 million to support a redevelopment project in downtown Cape Girardeau.
All four projects were added in the House, with the redevelopment project increased from $11 million to $20 million in the Senate. 
There had been hints the Senate additions to the bill might cause problems, Hovis said, but he did not know when he returned to the floor after the recess that no action would be taken.
“I did not know, the day of, that we were not going to bring the bill up for a vote, but we’re still discussing it as a caucus and want to stay unified,” Hovis said.
Kehoe could bring lawmakers back to pass the bill in a special session or lawmakers could decide to do that on their own.
“I hope that we can come up with some sort of a plan or position that would allow us to revisit this,” Hovis said, “because there are still some options that could be considered, like a special session or something along those lines.”

(Laina G. Stebbins | Michigan Advance)The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa is preparing to argue against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issuing a permit to reroute Enbridge’s Line 5 oil pipeline in northern Wisconsin. 
For years, the tribe has fought against Line 5, which runs from far Northwest Wisconsin 645 miles into Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, under the Straits of Mackinac and across the U.S. border  into Canada near Detroit. It transports about 23 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids daily. 
An underground section of the pipeline currently passes near a bend in the Bad River on the tribe’s reservation. In 2023, a federal judge ruled that the company was trespassing on tribal land and gave Enbridge three years to shut down the pipeline. 
Since 2020, Enbridge has been working on rerouting the pipeline about 41 miles away from tribal land. That proposal requires permits to be issued by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
The tribe is also currently challenging the state’s permitting process. Hearings will be held in August, September and October in Madison and Ashland in which an administrative law judge will hear arguments against the DNR’s decision to issue permits for the project. 
Army Corps approval of Enbridge’s plan to replace a separate section of the pipeline on the floor of the Straits of Mackinac has been fast tracked under President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring a national energy emergency, but the Bad River section of the pipeline is still moving forward under the normal approval process. 
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Bad River Band and its attorneys will present to the Corps their finding that the proposed rerouted pipeline, which would pass the Bad River upstream of the reservation, threatens the tribe’s water quality and therefore violates the Clean Water Act. 
The tribe’s presentation is scheduled to take all day Tuesday and some of Wednesday. Members of the public will then be able to provide public comment during a virtual hearing and send written comments for 30 days after the hearing. 
Robert Blanchard, the tribe’s chairman, says he’s working to protect the tribe’s resources and way of life by bringing the challenge. 
“Ultimately, we are protecting our resources. We’re downstream from this project. If it were to go in, were to happen, there’s a lot at stake just with how this will affect our waters,” he says. “We have one of the biggest wild rice areas on the Great Lakes. We have a lot of medicines that I and members of my community collect that have been around for hundreds of years, and we have hunting and fishing rights that will be affected. You know, if we can’t use those because of what’s happening upstream, then that will affect our way of life.” 
Juli Kellner, a spokesperson for Enbridge, says the hearings this week are an important step for completing the project, which she adds won’t affect water quality. 
“Extensive and thorough analysis by leading, third-party experts has confirmed that construction impacts will be temporary and isolated, have no measurable impact on water quality, and will not violate the Bad River Band’s water quality standards,” Kellner says. “The project will have environmental protections and restoration plans in place, as approved by state regulators. State permits were issued last fall. We’re confident the Corps is close to completing its process which has included more than five years of public input, expert studies, and rigorous review. In fact, this is one of the most studied projects in Wisconsin’s history.” 
Under the Clean Water Act, if the Corps finds that the project will adversely affect a downstream jurisdiction’s water quality and there are no conditions that can be put on the permit to ensure water quality standards aren’t violated, the permit cannot be granted, according to the tribe’s attorney, Stefanie Tsosie. 
“We are presenting evidence to the Army Corps that the band’s water quality standards will be affected, and there are no conditions that they can put on the project permit such that they can issue it,” she says. “So, I think our hope here is one, to show how much the project is going to impact the advanced water quality, but then two, urge the Corps to not issue the section 404 permit eventually.” 
But the hearing is taking place as the Trump administration has worked to encourage more extraction of natural resources, boost the oil industry and go easier on polluters. Last week, the climate-focused news outlet Grist reported that under Trump, the EPA has practically stopped enforcing the country’s environmental laws. 
Tsosie says all the tribe can work with is what the law says. 
“Well, the standard in the Clean Water Act is pretty clear,” she says. “And that’s statute, so that’s what we’re going with.” 
Blanchard says he can’t forecast what the Corps is going to do, but he can just make his best case that granting the permit will be harmful to everyone who lives downstream. 
“I wish I had that crystal ball to be able to forecast that, but I don’t, so what we’re going to do tomorrow is do our very best to convince them that this is the way it should be,” he says. “We need to look after our Mother Earth, to pay attention to what we’re doing, what’s happening to it, and like I said before, it’s going to affect not just our way of life and not just those that live in the region, not just us as Anishinaabe people, but everybody.” 
If the Corps grants the permit, that decision could still be challenged in court.

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
Congressional budget agency projects sweeping Medicaid cutbacks in states under GOP plans

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
 Half of U.S. kids

About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
For Medicaid cuts, national work requirements being considered, says Idaho’s U.S. Rep. Fulcher

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
 School health services

Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”










As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services


But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”
Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

A rainbow appears after a March 31, 2023, tornado tore a path through Little Rock. (Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)In the 30 days after several damaging twisters hit Arkansas on March 14, the state saw nearly four times as many tornado warnings as Texas did.
The National Weather Service issued 144 warnings in Arkansas, compared to 39 in Texas from March 14 to April 14. Mississippi also recorded 144 warnings over the same period and Tennessee saw 125 warnings. Alabama noted 57 warnings.
It’s an indication that the classic “Tornado Alley” region — the area from central Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas, so named because of the number of tornadoes there — is shifting eastward.
The shift is attributed to climate change, the warming of the Gulf of Mexico’s waters and a dip in the cold jet stream pattern.
Arkansas, scientists say, is nearly in the bull’s eye of a new tornado-prone area that’s referred to as “Dixie Alley.”  The region, which has seen a vast increase in tornadoes over the past several years, also encompasses Mississippi, Alabama and western Tennessee.
Weather Service survey teams have already confirmed 35 tornadoes have touched down in Arkansas through April. The state averages 42 twisters per year.
The storms have also been larger.  Arkansas was hit with two EF-4 twisters on March 14 — one in Jackson County and one in Izard County
The last time a tornado of that strength hit the state was on April 27, 2014, when a tornado cut a 41-mile path of destruction through western Pulaski County, Mayflower and Vilonia in Faulkner County, and on into White County. Sixteen people died in that storm.
Victor Gensini, a professor of meteorology at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois, conducted research about the shift, authoring a paper in 2018 that noted the change. Since then, he’s continued to monitor the trend and says the trend is ongoing.
“It’s still more prevalent in the southeast,” he said. “And we’re seeing more evidence of that each year.”
‘Drying up’
Gensini tracked tornado reports from 1979 to 2018 for his initial study, but also noted atmospheric conditions in the areas at the time that were favorable for the formation of tornadoes.
Gensini blames a combination of weather phenomenon for the increase in Arkansas’ tornadoes. A drought in the southwest is taking away needed moisture for the formation of twisters in the traditional Tornado Alley region.
More than 67% of Arizona is experiencing “extreme” and “exceptional” drought conditions — the two highest levels of drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The Drought Monitor is based at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln and records weather conditions and patterns weekly.
Three months ago, only 17% of Arizona was under the same two drought conditions. A year ago, the state was considered free from extreme and exceptional drought.
New Mexico, Texas and Utah have also seen increases in drought in their respective states. Thirty percent of Texas is in “extreme” and “exceptional” drought, an increase from 14% three months ago.
“The most intense levels of drought now cover a broad area from southeastern California, southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah through much of Arizona, New Mexico and the Texas Big Bend, said Richard Tinker, a meteorologist with the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, and the author of the latest drought report.
“The southern Great Plains are drying up,” Gensini added.
 Faster rate of change

The dry atmospheric conditions in the southwest create a dome of high pressure over the western U.S., sapping energy from the atmosphere and forcing potential tornado-producing systems to move further east. The jet stream, a strong current of frigid Arctic air, is also dipping further south into the Mississippi delta region because of the Southwestern drought.
Water temperature in the Gulf has also increased on average by one or two degrees, creating the moist, humid air needed for tornadoes.
“One or two degrees may not seem much. But think of the difference between 32 degrees and 33 degrees,” Gensini said, referring to the temperature when water freezes. “It’s early in the season, and the waters are warmer. That warm, humid air is heading into Arkansas where the air has been unstable already. It makes things more potent.
“We’re seeing weather pattern changes over the last 70 to 80 years that didn’t happen in 100,000 to 120,000 years before,” he said. “There is such a rapid rate of change, and it’s not lessening.”
Of the 144 warnings issued in Arkansas between March 14 and April 14, not all produced tornadoes, said Dennis Cavanaugh, the National Weather Service warning coordinator in North Little Rock.
In fact, the Weather Service strives to keep its “false alarm” rate of tornado warnings to less than 80%. Warnings are issued when Doppler weather radar picks up rotation in clouds, signature “inflow notches” that indicate the building of cyclonic air patterns, hail cores and other indicators.
The Weather Service also must balance the need to warn people while also not unnecessarily alarming them. Issue too many warnings that don’t produce tornadoes, and the public may become complacent and not heed future warnings as seriously.  John Robinson, a former Meteorologist in Charge at the North Little Rock station, used to say that more people were injured in tornadoes while gawking at clouds for confirmation of those tornadoes rather than seeking shelter when warnings were issued.
On the other side, if the Weather Service curtails its warnings and an unwarned tornado does form, results could be devastating.
“Radar can’t see tornadoes,” Cavanaugh said. “It can see circulation aloft when it’s likely a tornado is forming. If we wait to see the debris cloud from a tornado that’s on the ground to issue a warning, it’s much too late.”

 More hail

Cavanaugh said continued advances in technology should help the Weather Service lower its rate of false alarms. But the service will always rely on trained storm spotters who can see the lowering of wall clouds — a first step in the formation of tornadoes — and any circulation of clouds overhead.
“That’s really not applicable to this year,” he said of the fear that the scores of warnings issued may eventually be ignored. “I don’t think the average Arkansan thought he or she was not warned unnecessarily.”
During a round of storms one April evening, Ryan Vaughn, the meteorologist for KAIT8 in Jonesboro, was broadcasting live storm coverage. At one point, most of northeast Arkansas was placed under a myriad of tornado warnings.
Vaughn took a deep sigh on air.
“I don’t think I’ve ever said this before, but if you’re anywhere in northeast Arkansas, take cover now,” he told viewers.
Tornadoes are formed by opposing winds at various levels. Strong winds in opposite directions cause a shear and a horizontal column of air circulating overhead. Warm, humid air feeds the twister and eventually the column of air begins tilting vertically and lowering to become a destructive tornado.
And if the increase in tornadoes in Arkansas and the Delta is not enough, Gensini said the ingredients for twister formation should also cause larger hail storms.
Hail is formed inside supercell thunderstorms. The rising air inside a building storm lofts raindrops into freezing air. It causes hail, which falls to the ground. Many times, a frozen raindrop falls in the size of a pea or gravel. But with more convection inside the stronger storms, that pea-sized bit of hail is lofted over and over again inside the system, growing larger as more water freezes on it.
That’s what causes the golf ball- and baseball-sized hail and are indicative of stronger storms and tornadoes.
Gensini is about to embark on a 40-day field study this summer of hail storms.
“Tornadoes get all the attention on the news because of the visual destruction,” he said. “You see a path of destruction with shattered homes. But hail is much worse overall.  It damages roofs, cars and agriculture in a much larger area.
“I think the south and southeast will see a lot more problems in the years coming,” he said.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner) For more than two years Wisconsin child care providers have been warning that failing to provide ongoing support will mean their fees will go up and their numbers shrink drastically.
Starting Tuesday, some providers will try to give lawmakers and the public a taste of what that could look like — by staging a strike.
Their goal is to persuade Republican leaders on the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee to commit to including in the state budget a significant child care support program.
Gov. Tony Evers’ proposed $480 million child care measure was among more than 600 items the committee removed on Thursday, May 8, from the draft budget Evers proposed for 2025-27. The motion to remove the items passed 12-3 with only Republican votes.
“We are demanding that the Joint Finance Committee guarantees they will put $480 million of state dollars back into the budget” for child care support, Corrine Hendrickson, a New Glarus child care provider and advocate, told the Wisconsin Examiner Monday.
Until they get such a guarantee, some providers have decided to close their doors, Hendrickson said.
Providers who intend to shut down their operations on Tuesday will go to the state Capitol for a press conference organized by Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), which Hendrickson cofounded. They plan to remain at the Capitol at least through the rest of this week, she said.
“The goal is that Republicans and Democrats will stop by and talk to us about our concerns,” Hendrickson said. She added she was hoping for “a real conversation” about measures that child care providers favor as well as proffered solutions that they oppose — “since they keep leaving us out of these conversations.”
Hendrickson said Monday afternoon that about 100 participants — providers, child care workers and parents in support of their actions — were expected at the Capitol Tuesday. She said there was not a count yet of how many child care centers might close.
Organizers have established a donation portal with Community Change Action to raise funds that will be used to offset lost wages for child care workers and providers who take part in the walkout, Hendrickson said.  
‘Day Without Child Care’ events
The action planned to start Tuesday follows events across Wisconsin Monday for “A Day Without Child Care” —a national campaign to draw attention to the need for child care programs and their need for stronger financial resources.
At a rally Monday morning in New Glarus, parents, state officials both elected and appointed, education leaders, local economic boosters and child care providers took turns championing the need for a state investment that would strengthen child care providers.
“Whether you’re a parent, an employer, an educator or a policy advisor, child care affects each and every one of us and it touches our future as well,” Cortney Barry, director of the New Glarus Chamber of Commerce, said at the rally. “The current system is not working, especially in small communities like ours. It’s just stretched too thin. It’s fragile, and it’s scary to think just how close we are to a true crisis.”
Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski said business leaders she met with in central Wisconsin last week told her that child care was a pressing need for them to be able to hire locally rather than going out of state, and that they could not find workers “not because people don’t want to work for [them] — they can’t find a place to send their kids.”
Democratic lawmakers and parents have since 2023 pushed to continue the monthly Child Care Counts support program that Wisconsin began with the help of federal money during the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds bolstered child care providers’ revenues so they could raise wages without charging parents more for care.
“We lost 6,000 [child care] programs between 2010 and 2019,” Hendrickson said at the New Glarus rally. “You know what stopped [the decline]? COVID — when we started getting money. All of the sudden we had more programs open at the end of the year than we had at the beginning of the year. It worked.”
A proposal to continue Child Care Counts with state funds was stripped from Evers’ 2023-25 budget, and the Legislature’s Republican majority repeatedly rejected attempts to restore the funding. The Evers administration was able to continue a reduced support program, but that will end with the final payment to child care centers early this summer.
That has escalated a campaign to keep the program going with state funds. In a state survey released in April 25% or more providers said they might close without continued support at the level Child Care Counts provided.
Hendrickson said at the New Glarus rally 54% of providers in Green County in the survey expected to close after the state funding program ends. Half of providers will have to raise tuition, she said — including her family child care business, which cares for eight children.
Even with fee increases totaling $50 a week phased in over the months of August and September to replace lost Child Care Counts revenue and higher expenses, “I will still be taking a pay cut,” she added.
Brooke Legler, the other WECAN cofounder and operator of The Growing Tree child care center in New Glarus, said shutting down to protest starting Tuesday is “our last effort — it’s the only thing we have as a community, as a profession, that we can say, like, ‘No, I’m not going to subsidize the economy off of my pay, off of the teachers that work there.’”
Providers who can’t shut down
Other child care providers who took part in Monday’s Day Without Child Care campaign across the state said they cannot shut down in protest this week, but they support providers who choose to do so.
In Waupaca, Tracy Jensen, director of Sunny Day Child Care, used the day as a teach-in for parents. “We  were raising awareness about the true cost of child care and how important it is to have child care in our community,” Jensen told the Wisconsin Examiner.
About 75 parents came through the center Monday, and Jensen said she plans to continue the opportunities for more such parent education through the week.
Sunny Day is the largest center in Waupaca County, Jensen said, with a license for 292 children at one time. There are 350 families with children enrolled currently, and a waiting list of 70 families, she said.
Jensen said that given the center’s size it won’t take part in the organized shut down. She said she told employees that if they want to go to Madison Tuesday to voice their concerns they can do so, and she has tried to organize staffing to make that possible.
Tricia Peterson directs Future All Stars Academy in Juneau. On Monday she closed the center for a day and took 11 employees to an event in Waunakee, where providers, staff and parents rallied.
Peterson won’t close Future All Stars for the walkout starting Tuesday, however.
“I’m not in a position right now to do that,” she said, “But I will say I will do everything I can in support of that.”
The center’s long-term future will depend on the state budget, however.
“I’m one of those centers that if funding doesn’t come forward in June, we’ll have to close,” Peterson said. She’s already notified parents about that possibility.
“They understood where we were coming from,” Peterson said. “We didn’t have one parent complain.”

Management plan that was a decade in the making calls for continued monitoring, but does not impose any new regulations to give the wary bruins space. 
The post Shoshone Forest: No trail restrictions, area closures needed to safeguard moth-eating grizzlies appeared first on WyoFile .","CODY—Hundreds of moth-eating grizzly bears will gather in backcountry talus fields in the months to come. It’s a high-altitude gathering similar to coastal bruins’ seasonal salmon feasts that serve as well-publicized spectacles.
But land and wildlife managers face hard choices when it comes to spreading word of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s remarkable natural phenomenon, which occurs chiefly in the Absaroka Range. Backcountry travelers should know about it — the grizzlies can be easily displaced from the sites. Yet, educational information aimed at keeping people safe and grizzlies undisturbed can also have unintended consequences.
“We don’t want to encourage people to visit moth sites, although we realize some people are going to do it anyhow,” Shoshone National Forest Wildlife Biologist Andy Pils told a room full of grizzly managers on May 1 in Cody.

“There’s kind of that fine line between providing enough information to people that they can make good decisions about their safety,” Pils said, “without doing stuff to actually encourage more people to show up.” 
A grizzly that’s in moth-gobbling mode can down 40,000 of the insects daily, but land and wildlife managers believe there are not too many people showing up to compromise the bears’ access to the calorie-rich food source. 
That’s among the findings of the Shoshone National Forest’s first-ever management plan for the roughly three dozen known army cutworm moth sites distributed around the Abasoka Range.

Pils presented the plan to the public for the first time at the Cody meeting, a gathering of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee’s Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee. Someday, he explained, there may be a need for measures like permitting systems to access moth sites or restricting travel to designated trails.
Monitoring of the sites and human use of the area would continue under the plan. Every three years, Pils said, grizzly and land managers will look at the latest data and make recommendations for any changes, should the need arise. 
Seldom visited 
Currently, only one moth site — and Pils and others didn’t identify it — sees anything more than very occasional human use. WyoFile visited the site with the wildlife biologist in summer 2022 and watched as grizzly bears scattered upon seeing peak-bagging humans and a dog. The interaction aligns with research from former Montana State University graduate student Erika Nunlist, who observed 43 human-bear interactions in 2017 and ‘18 and found that moth site grizzlies walked or ran away from people 80% of the time. 
Using trailhead surveys, registers and peak logs at the same site in 2024, Pils and colleagues found that human use of the most trafficked moth site had not significantly increased.

Human use of the other 35 moth site areas is mostly restricted to ungulate hunters, who come in the highest numbers after grizzlies’ seasonal feast has slowed.
The Shoshone National Forest has been assessing its moth sites in consideration of management changes since 2015, when it completed its Forest Plan. Before that, around 15 years ago, Yellowstone region managers prioritizing grizzly bear issues identified the moth sites as a top-three issue in the ecosystem, U.S. Forest Service biologist Dan Tyers told the room in Cody. 
Moth bear basics
Subsequently, a team of researchers launched into years-long studies, gathering information about human-grizzly interactions, where army cutworm moths are coming from and what grizzlies are eating in the subalpine aside from the fatty insects. They learned — and presented to the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee’s subcommittee — that the moths come from many directions, which insulates the moth bears against regional declines. Additionally, biscuitroot was identified as a key supplementary food source for the bears. 
Wildlife managers have also ramped up routine monitoring of the moth sites and the hundreds of bears that use them. A decade ago, they conducted census flights to count every individual bear that was using the rock fields and adjacent alpine meadows. 
“We counted upwards of 220 bears on these sites,” Wyoming Game and Fish Department Large Carnivore Biologist Justin Clapp told the room in Cody. “That was somewhere between 20 and 25% of the entire population estimate.”

Spatially, the sites represent less than 1% of the grizzly-occupied landscape, he said. The moth grizzlies, in other words, are highly concentrated. 
Aided by aerial captures — a technique that debuted for grizzlies in Wyoming — wildlife managers have also been able to get tracking collars on 85 individual bears that use moth sites. The location data those collars produced show that, on average, grizzlies arrive on July 12 and depart on Sept. 8, Clapp said.
During that couple of months, grizzlies are taking it relatively easy: Moth site-users move about 50% less, Clapp said.

Females, the biologist said, are especially fond of the moth sites. Sows are a disproportionately high segment of the moth bear population, and they arrive earlier and stay later. 
“It does seem to be a space where females can take cubs in close proximity to males,” Clapp said, “and not have high concerns about infanticide.”
Game changer?
While Shoshone National Forest officials have not yet signaled the need for any rigid regulations to safeguard moth sites, there are scenarios where restrictions would become much more likely. Given the extraordinary nature of the phenomenon, it’s within the realm of possibilities that an internationally renowned documentarian could set his or her sights on the grizzlies lapping up moths high in the Absarokas. Just like that, Wyoming’s moth-eating grizzlies could become much better known.
“That’s why we want to track this stuff over time,” Pils told WyoFile. 
Commercial film permit requests have come in pulses, he said, but since the Shoshone Forest Plan was completed in 2015, all have been denied.

With a moth site management plan now in place, there’s a “framework” going forward for evaluating the requests, Pils said.  
“It’s going to depend on the specifics of what they want to do,” he said. “Ultimately, it’s the forest supervisor that’s going to make the decision.” 
Currently at the Shoshone National Forest, that’s Ken Coffin. At the Cody meeting, he told WyoFile that there’s a “fine line” between good and bad exposure, but that he’s committed to reviewing commercial filming requests on a case-by-case basis.

There’s good that comes from telling stories about the Yellowstone ecosystem, like the grizzly bear moth sites, he said. 
“But it brings more notoriety,” Coffin said. “It’s good, but it’s also concerning.” 
For now, the locations of moth sites are being closely guarded. Overview maps presented at the Cody meeting marked the Absaroka Range sites, but the markings were redacted from documents since uploaded online. 
“Specific moth site locations … it really is considered sensitive data to us at this time,” Clapp said.

A recent court ruling against the state, legislative promises to expand school choice and new property tax cuts, present a ""real challenge,"" Gordon said. 
The post Governor: Paying for both public ed, expanded school choice poses ‘substantial concerns’ for Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","RIVERTON—School choice advocates made major legislative advances in Wyoming this year with the passage of a universal school voucher program and the removal of caps on charter school approvals.
Now, paying for these initiatives on top of the state’s already large constitutional obligation to fund public education will be a challenge, Gov. Mark Gordon said. 
“I have substantial concerns,” Gordon told WyoFile during an interview Friday in at Central Wyoming College. “I think the Legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things.”
Another major factor at play is the February ruling from Laramie County District Court Judge Peter Froelicher that the Wyoming Legislature has been constitutionally underfunding education and must remedy that. 
“The state just got stung with a lawsuit, and I think the judge was pretty clear about needing to meet the requirements under the [Wyoming] Constitution for funding education,” Gordon said. “We, at the same time, have provided a lot more school choice. And all of those things are coming due.”
Wyoming’s new Steamboat Legacy Scholarship education savings account program is scheduled to open its application process to families Thursday. The program will give up to $7,000 per K-12 student to Wyoming families to pay for private education costs. The bill that created it was hotly debated in the Legislature, with critics asserting that it plainly violates the constitution. 
Along with that, the Legislature overrode Gordon’s attempt to veto a bill that removed the cap on the number of charter schools Wyoming’s new authorizing board could approve. 
While a school-choice supporter, Gordon wrote in his veto letter, “I cannot, in good conscience, approve an expansion in charter schools at a time when our public education system faces significant financial uncertainty and the framework to support the expansion of Charter Schools remains incomplete.”

Finally, Wyoming lawmakers are gearing up to undergo “recalibration.” The process, which is mandated every five years, entails a comprehensive review of how Wyoming funds education and what it offers students in its so-called “basket of goods,” or what is being taught.
In the wake of the court ruling against Wyoming, many anticipate the process will force lawmakers to pony up more money. Plaintiffs hope it results in everything from better teacher pay to more mental health resources at schools. 
“The State’s failures have affected Wyoming children’s right to a proper education,” Froelicher wrote in the 186-page ruling. The judge ordered the state to modify its funding model in manners consistent with its obligation.
Wyoming will challenge the court decision, according to a March notice of appeal filed in Laramie District Court.
Still, Gordon said the various education factors have created a difficult task. 
“I think the Legislature was very good about providing choice, but they were not necessarily measured in a way that they understood what the consequences would be,” Gordon said.
Legislators also passed a law to significantly cut property taxes, which will result in declining local revenues for school districts around the state.  
Reimagining 
Gordon was at Central Wyoming College in Riverton for a celebration of his administration’s Reimagine and Innovate the Delivery of Education Initiative, or RIDE. The program, which aims at fundamentally rethinking Wyoming’s traditional education models with more emphasis on student-led learning, is wrapping up its second year of implementation.

Twenty school districts have signed up to participate, with nine districts serving as pilot schools in the inaugural 2023/24 school year and another round joining for the school year that is ending.
The program has been hard to nail down given the scope of schools and curricula involved, but events like Friday’s bring forth tangible examples of what it looks like: firing off rockets and using range finders to understand mathematical concepts; honing the art of meaningful conversations in an era dominated by cellphones; sending students to gain clinical experience by working hospital shifts and teaching students how to complete the real-world task of tax filing. 
While traveling the state to see the educational strategies firsthand, Gordon has witnessed Cody students interning at law offices, Powell students learning taxidermy in art class and Kemmerer students who get a chance to coach PE. 
“They’re unique, but they all have a commonality of kids coming away with basic things that they need … that will help them graduate and go on and be successful,” Gordon said. 
Wyoming shouldn’t be concerned with national trends, he told the audience in a speech kicking off the RIDE event. “We should be worrying about what we’re able to accomplish,” he said. “Wyoming is a leader.”
Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder also spoke at the RIDE Celebration, saying the first two years of the program “are only the beginning.”

She framed the program as a way to clear obstacles or regulations from the education landscape, “and have the room to really move and innovate.”
Degenfelder’s education department is the agency tasked with standing up the school voucher program that opens applications this week. She has been a strong advocate of both school choice and limited government, and noted in her Friday speech that Wyoming is in a “historic” time as it relates to the federal government. 
President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order that set out a plan to close the federal Department of Education and return power to states.
“We have a unique opportunity, this window of time, that we can truly take what the feds are saying that they want to give more back to the states,” Degenfelder said, “and we can replicate what we’re doing here today all across the state.”

Pin the GENIUS Act's death on Trump’s shady crypto deals, coin memes and charlatan history, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Lummis’ allegiance to Trump led to crypto bill’s demise appeared first on WyoFile .","Trump loyalty proved to be the politically unsavvy move last Thursday for U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis. The Wyoming Republican, known as the “Crypto Queen,” has the president to blame for the death of the GENIUS Act — landmark legislation she co-sponsored to regulate the stablecoin industry.

Opinion

Despite working on the issue for years and chairing the Senate’s Digital Act Subcommittee, Lummis somehow missed that the majority of her colleagues wouldn’t vote to line Trump’s pockets.
The bill would have established the first federal framework for regulating payment stablecoins — cryptocurrency tokens pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. Although stablecoins have been widely used for more than a decade in both the crypto economy and traditional financial markets, a lack of regulation has led to uncertainty for businesses and consumers.
Trump and his family stood to seriously gain from the passage of the oh-so-cleverly named GENIUS Act — short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins. And though he was not the only long-time grifter who would have potentially benefited, Trump’s support alone was enough to kill it.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, saw to that. And Lummis couldn’t stop her.
The GENIUS Act was a bipartisan bill before Warren led its derailment. A long-time champion of consumer protection laws, Warren agrees that stablecoins should be regulated. She just wants to ensure such regulation doesn’t inadvertently hand Trump and his family billions of dollars, real or crypto.
World Liberty Financial, co-founded in late 2024 by the president’s son, Eric Trump, developed USD1 stablecoin. MGX, which is owned by the United Arab Emirates, announced it will buy $2 billion worth of USD1 stablecoin and use it to invest in Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. 
“The Trump family stablecoin surged to the seventh largest in the world because of a shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates — a foreign government that will give them a crazy amount of money,” Warren warned on social media. “The Senate shouldn’t pass a crypto bill this week to facilitate this corruption.”


In case you think this corruption talk is hyperbolic, consider this: Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported in March that Binance founder Changpeng Zhao — who recently served a four-month prison sentence for money laundering — was seeking a pardon from Trump amid discussions of a business deal between the president’s family and Binance. 
Zhao initially denied that he applied to Trump for a pardon, then admitted it on a podcast. Say, how many stablecoins does a presidential pardon cost these days?
Five Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, including GENIUS Act co-sponsors Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, joined GOP members in voting for the bill in April. But that was before news of the UAE’s deal with World Liberty Financial went public.
Warren called for Democrats to drop their support unless Republicans adopt stronger provisions on anti-money laundering, foreign issuers, national security and accountability for noncompliance. 
Warren logically contends Trump’s position as president gives World Liberty Financial an undue advantage and an upper hand in the market, given the Trump administration’s pro-crypto policies that could lead to insider trading.
In January, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the U.S. and directed his administration to promote the use of blockchain.
At a Digital Act Subcommittee meeting early last week, Democrats asked Lummis to delay an important procedural vote to allow more time for negotiations. The chairwoman denied the motion, likely sealing the bill’s demise.
Two days before the vote, Lummis reportedly left a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York full of optimism. “We had a great meeting, and I came away with the impression that they still truly do want to get something across the finish line,” she told the Washington Examiner.
Lummis, who stressed it wasn’t a partisan bill, sounded confident that it had enough Democratic support to pass. But it was a serious miscalculation on her part, and ignored how fed-up many Americans are with Trump’s never-ending schemes to make his devoted followers part with their money and enrich his family.
Prior to his presidency, Trump hawked Trump Wine and Trump Steaks, had ghostwriters pen Trump best-sellers, and enrolled dupes in Trump University. He went bankrupt building casinos and hotels before hosting NBC’s “The Apprentice,” forever solidifying his phony reputation as a business titan.
After losing the 2020 election, Trump’s money-making schemes were mostly ways to raise funds to pay enormous legal bills. They included $333 Trump gold sneakers with a “strict limit of three per customer,” Trump bibles, and a surreal line of Trump digital trading cards depicting him as superheroes and athletes.
Back in the White House in 2025, Trump is hustling to promote crypto any way he can. The U.S. Constitution prohibits Trump from seeking a third term, but it didn’t deter him from hosting a closed-door, $1.5-million-per-plate “Crypto & AI Innovators Dinner” campaign fundraiser at his Washington-area golf club. 
The president is also peddling his own $TRUMP meme coins. Such coins usually have no intrinsic value in the crypto world, but Trump has a different game plan. He’s offering a free dinner at the same club on May 22 to the top 220 owners of his meme coin. 
The top 25 will win a bigger prize: a chance to personally schmooze with the leader of the free world at a pre-dinner reception. News about the contest naturally sparked more trading activity and higher prices.
Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, calls the event “a profoundly corrupt scheme that endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government.” He’s right: People who want to cultivate influence with Trump can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls. 
On the Senate floor a few hours before the vote, Warren said the bill “runs a substantial risk of blowing up the U.S. economy and putting us once more in a position where taxpayers have to bail out the billionaires while they end up paying for risks that the rich people took on.”
The cloture vote needed 60 senators to agree to debate the bill for it to advance, likely toward a quick passage. But every Democrat and two Republicans voted no. The final tally was 48-49.
Warren signed on to Merkley’s common-sense bill to ban presidents, lawmakers and their families from financially benefiting by issuing, endorsing or sponsoring crypto assets, including stablecoins. The End Crypto Corruption Act directly targets Trump and his family’s crypto ventures.
The president’s crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — or approximately $2.9 billion. 
Lummis, obviously stung by the lopsided defeat of her signature legislation, hasn’t said much publicly. Her office issued this statement from the senator: “I’m deeply disappointed that we were unable to pass this important, bipartisan-crafted stablecoin legislation. Make no mistake, digital assets are the future and America must lead the way.”
I don’t doubt Lummis’ sincere belief in the bill, but if she wants some version to pass while Republicans control both the House and Senate, she must finally temper her support of every single thing Trump does and realize it was his shenanigans that killed her bill.
Lummis did seem to acknowledge that when the New York Times asked her about Trump’s impact on the legislation. “It does give me pause because it complicates our work here,” she said.
That bipartisan legislation Lummis worked so hard on is now in a crumpled heap, and it won’t be resurrected without major concessions from the GOP that prevent money laundering, improve consumer protections, and keep politicians like Trump from exploiting the law. 
It won’t be easy to rebuild the coalition that formed to support the GENIUS Act, but Lummis now knows there are pro-crypto Democrats out there. Warren remains probably the biggest skeptic, but she obviously has the most clout on the issue within her party.
If Lummis wants to broker a deal that the minority party will accept, she should concentrate on winning over the Massachusetts senator. The bill may be Lummis’ pride and joy, but Warren is the key to it becoming a law.

Why are so many conservative politicians obsessed with denying the existence of transgender people? Several years ago, it was the infamous bathroom bill that sought to micromanage the public restrooms trans people used.
Now, the same forces are at it again with bills targeting transgender youth. Under legislation approved by the state House last week, charges of abuse and neglect against parents who refuse to acknowledge their child’s gender identity would be barred.
Supporters say the bill is about validating parental rights, but if that’s so, why did they defeat an amendment that would protected parents who acknowledge and support their transgender kids?
After all, some politicians have promoted attacks of precisely this kind on parents who love and celebrate their trans children.
The bottom line: Gender dysphoria is a long-established medical condition for which gender transition frequently amounts to lifesaving care. By denying this reality, lawmakers are assuring that some young people will be denied care and that their lives will be cruelly and needlessly endangered.

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Defense attorneys tried to poke holes Monday in the corruption case against a former Tennessee House speaker and his ex-top aide, saying they were starting a small political consulting company and simply made mistakes.
During closing arguments, Nashville defense attorney Ed Yarbrough said federal prosecutors “twisted” the law to create a litany of charges against his client, Glen Casada.
Casada and his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren, are charged with 19 counts of bribery, kickbacks, fraud and money laundering connected to a secretive political vendor named Phoenix Solutions that operated from late 2019 to mid-2020.
Casada and Cothren are accused of hiding Cothren’s role in Phoenix Solutions after he resigned from his state job in early 2019 in the midst of a racist and sexist texting scandal. Former Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson pleaded guilty to one charge three years ago and testified against the pair in hopes of getting a lesser sentence.
Yarbrough cast doubt on whether the federal charges filed against his client and Cothren even amounted to criminal activity, instead saying they were “amateur” business people who made “rookie errors.”
Cothren and Casada declined to testify in the trial as it entered the fourth week. 
Casada flipped story about knowledge of Phoenix Solutions 

Yarbrough argued that the missing “elephant in the room” was House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who didn’t testify either. Testimony showed he had authority to approve vendors for the state’s postage and printing program in which House members receive $3,000 annually for constituent mailers but allowed Phoenix Solutions to do work even though the state slow-walked payments to the company and consulting businesses owned by Casada and Smith. The defense also said a state handbook on the program didn’t have an official vendor approval process, only the payment protocol handled by former Legislative Administration Director Connie Ridley and ultimate approval by the Speaker’s office.
“How can you possibly convict anybody when you don’t know what Cameron Sexton would have said?” Yarbrough asked the jury.
Sexton was expected to be one of the prosecution’s star witnesses, along with Smith, and the defense subpoenaed him to testify, but neither side called him to the stand.
Cothren had said previously that he helped Sexton win the Speaker’s election after Casada stepped down in 2019, citing a list of text messages and phone calls. But those weren’t among the main pieces of evidence in the trial.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Blake Ellison made a portion of the prosecution’s closing argument, saying Cothren came up with a private business and used two state legislators to tap into state funds, which were described as “low-hanging fruit.”

“All of them lied,” Ellison said, and covered up Cothren’s role to receive kickbacks. 
In audio of Casada’s interview with FBI agents the morning they raided his Franklin condo five years ago, Casada told agents that Cothren couldn’t “deal” because Speaker Sexton didn’t like him. The inadvertent playing of that unreacted recording nearly led to a mistrial last week.
Testimony from former Rep. Patsy Hazlewood and Reps. Jay Reedy and Esther Helton-Haynes showed they wouldn’t have allowed Phoenix Solutions to handle their mailers if they had known Cothren was involved because of his role in the scandal.
Ellison told jurors the defendants forged an agreement with Smith to start Phoenix Solutions, which was set up through New Mexico’s secretary of state, and to keep Cothren’s part in the company secret because he was “politically radioactive.”
“They were eager to make an extra buck,” Ellison said, adding Smith and Casada were to use their positions as lawmakers to drum up business and then pressure Ridley to make payments.
Amid questions about Phoenix Solutions, the Legislative Administration office and Speaker’s office started requiring vendors to sign a federal W-9 tax form. Cothren signed the document as “Matthew Phoenix,” the owner of Phoenix Solutions. Cothren also signed a state form for direct bank deposit as “Matthew Phoenix.” 
Ellison said the trio came up with the story that Phoenix Solutions principals had been doing consulting work in Washington but were tired of the “Trump/DC” atmosphere.
Emails also showed Chip Saltsman, an advisor for Sexton, received information showing the company was run by “Matt Cyrus,” another bogus character.
If the FBI hadn’t shut down the scheme in 2021, it would have made the “conspirators an easy stream of money,” he said.
Both sides wrapped up arguments Monday and jury deliberation will begin on Tuesday.

Jared Polis signs Senate Bill 25-3, a gun safety measure, on April 10, 2025, at the Colorado Capitol. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado lawmakers, led by a Democratic majority in both chambers of the Legislature, passed a suite of firearm-related bills this year aimed to reduce gun violence and boost public safety.
Over the previous two years, Colorado had enacted gun laws concerning a minimum purchasing age, purchase waiting period, safe storage in vehicles, and an expansion of the type of people who can petition courts to remove a potentially dangerous person’s firearm.
They did more this year, such as passing what could be the most consequential gun law in recent history with a permit-to-purchase program for most semiautomatic rifles.

Safety training for guns with detachable magazines
Beginning in August 2026, purchasers will need a special permit to buy certain semiautomatic firearms that can accept detachable ammunition magazines. Without the permit, they can buy models of those firearms that have fixed, 15-round-maximum magazines, which are far less common.
Those provisions are in Senate Bill 25-3.
People will need to be vetted by their county sheriff, take a safety class and pass a test to get a permit, which will be valid for five years. The training will be four hours for people who have gone through hunter education and 12 hours for everyone else.
“If you’re going to be purchasing these weapons, it should be your responsibility to make sure that you’re educated on how to safely use these weapons. I think that’s common sense,” Polis said when he signed the bill in April.
Polis wants to see financial assistance for lower-income Coloradans who wish to obtain a permit, and he also thinks some people, such as retired law enforcement and former military personnel, should not have to undergo redundant training.
The bill was originally introduced as an outright ban on the manufacture, sale, purchase and transfer of those types of guns with detachable magazines. It was proposed as a way to enforce an existing large-capacity magazine ban. The permit-to-purchase program was amended into the bill in the Senate to get Polis on board.
Gun show security plans
The promoter of a gun show will need to submit a security plan for the event to local law enforcement starting next year under House Bill 25-1238, which Polis signed in April. Additionally, promoters will need to carry liability insurance, make sure vendors have the proper federal and state licenses and have video surveillance of all areas of the gun show, including the parking area.
Children will not be able to attend a gun show without a parent or guardian.
“One of the best ways we can prevent gun violence is by requiring firearm dealers and gun show promoters to utilize proven methods that keep guns out of the wrong hands, like running background checks, securely storing firearms and ammunition, and boosting security measures like video cameras,” bill sponsor Rep. Sean Camacho, a Denver Democrat, said in a statement when the bill passed the House. “This legislation helps enforce responsible gun-selling practices and that makes gun shows more resilient to illegal sales or theft.
In a signing statement, Polis emphasized the law would not impact “gun collector shows” that concern collectible firearms like curios, relics or antique firearms.
Self-imposed restrictions
Senate Bill 25-34, a suicide prevention measure, would allow people to voluntarily waive their right to buy a gun by giving their name to the Colorado Bureau of Investigations through an online portal. They could also include information of someone to contact if they try to buy a gun while the voluntary waiver is in effect. CBI will need to verify someone’s identity before adding them to the “Do Not Sell” list. People could then remove themselves from that list after 30 days.
“We know that when people have mental health issues, sometimes they feel better and sometimes they feel worse. And we know that when people feel better, they might know that when they feel worse, they might not want to be able to go purchase a firearm,” bill sponsor Sen. Cathy Kipp, a Fort Collins Republican, said on the floor in April.
Polis has not yet taken action on the bill.
Gun information from schools
Under House Bill 25-1250, schools will need to provide materials about gun violence prevention to students’ parents or guardians at the start of each year. They will also need to post the materials, developed by the state Office of Gun Violence Prevention, online.
“Some of the most devastating and preventable tragedies in our nation’s history have happened in Colorado schools, and one in three Colorado middle and high school students say they can access a firearm in their home,” bill sponsor Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Jefferson County Democrat, said in a statement after it passed the Senate. “Safe storage dramatically reduces firearm suicides and overall youth firearm fatalities. Information is power, and this bill simply helps inform and educate students and their families about gun violence and how to prevent it.”
Polis has not yet taken action on the bill.
New felonies for gun thefts
A rare bipartisan gun-related bill, House Bill 25-1062, would make all firearm thefts a felony, instead of structuring the charge based on the value of the stolen gun. All firearm thefts would be a Class 6 felony, which can result in a prison sentence up to four years and fines up to $100,000.
Bill supporters say it will deter gun theft and reduce the circulation of stolen guns in illegal markets. The potential misuse and lethality of guns are reasons to treat them differently than other stolen goods, they said.
“By setting a consistent felony classification for firearm theft, the state signals that stealing guns carries a significant consequence,” bill sponsor Rep. Ryan Armagost, a Berthoud Republican, said during floor debate on the bill. “Stolen firearms often end up in the hands of people who cannot legally purchase firearms, such as felons or minors, and are frequently used in violent crimes.”
This bill passed on a bipartisan vote. Polis has not yet taken action on it.

Impact Dakota temporarily lost its federal funding last month. Jodie Mjoen, CEO and president of Impact Dakota, said federal funding is usually renewed on April 1. This year on April 1, he was informed that the federal funding — more than $800,000 for the year — was being pulled by the Trump administration. 
  Jodie Mjoen, and president of Impact Dakota (photo courtesy of Impact Dakota)
“We were told about 5 p.m. on the 1st that they weren’t going to renew the funds, and we had no advance notice at all,” Mjoen said. “And so we were scrambling.”  
The nonprofit organization got a reprieve a couple weeks later, but with funding only for the next six months instead of the usual year. 
Impact Dakota did have some revenue coming in from 22 ongoing projects, Mjoen said. Manufacturers that use Impact Dakota for training often pay fees that provide the matching money needed to be eligible for the federal grant. 
But without the federal funding, Mjoen said it essentially cut the organization’s revenue in half. 
Without federal funding being restored, “We would have been probably shut down within 30 to 60 days,” Mjoen said. 
Jeff Edberg is vice president of operations at Spectrum Aeromed, a company that makes interiors for air ambulances and is based at Hector International Airport in Fargo. He also chairs the Impact Dakota board. 
He said the funding reprieve gives the organization a little time to work on a Plan B if funding is cut in September. 
“We do have a little bit of a reprieve to dig into that little bit more,” he said, with a board meeting coming up later this month. 
Mjoen said the organization may be forced to focus more on North Dakota’s larger cities.
“One of the things we’ve always prided ourselves on is that we’re able to support manufacturers in every single community throughout North Dakota,” Mjoen said.
Impact Dakota is part of a national network of state programs supporting manufacturing. Mjoen said the program can offer on-site assessments and advice on how to make the best use of space in a facility and make the manufacturing process more efficient. 
Mjoen said Impact Dakota, which has seven employees, can provide some classes to multiple employers at the same time, providing training at a lower cost than private consultants in the Twin Cities or Denver.
Mjoen said value-added agriculture processing is a large manufacturing sector and Impact Dakota helps those businesses navigate and comply with federal regulations.  
Edberg’s Spectrum Aeromed has been among the beneficiaries. 
“It’s a great resource for all manufacturers in North Dakota,” Edberg said. 
Impact North Dakota also works with the state Commerce Department. The department reimburses some businesses for the cost of using Impact Dakota’s services.

“While it’s difficult to predict the exact impact of federal funding cuts on Impact Dakota, we remain hopeful,” Kim Schmidt, communications manager for the state Commerce Department said in an email to the North Dakota Monitor. 
“Federal funding is secure through September, and we are optimistic that Impact Dakota will adapt and find alternative sources if needed. We expect more clarity in the coming months as federal priorities for manufacturing growth are revealed.”
 The Commerce Department also administers the North Dakota Development Fund that received $5 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to create Automate ND. Impact Dakota helped assess the applicants for the grant program to address workforce shortages through automation. 
Impact Dakota also is working with Bismarck State College on a program to use virtual reality to expose people with disabilities to potential careers in manufacturing.  
Impact Dakota dates back to 1999. Mjoen has been with the organization for six years. 
“The reward is being able to help and grow these companies,” Mjoen said. 
Mjoen said Trump administration tariffs and economic uncertainty mean manufacturers have to be even more cost conscious. 
“It seems really bad timing for cuts to come,” Mjoen said. “The program is more needed tomorrow than it is today.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”



As hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services


But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”
Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Cherlynn Stevenson, the former Kentucky House Democratic caucus chair, announced Tuesday that she plans to seek election to the state’s open U.S. House seat in 2026. 
Stevenson, of Lexington, is the first Democratic candidate to say she’s vying to succeed Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District. Barr, who has represented the central Kentucky district since 2013, announced last month that he is running for the U.S. Senate seat opened by Sen. MItch McConnell’s announced retirement.
Stevenson won a seat in the Kentucky legislature in 2018 and won a close reelection bid against a Republican challenger in 2022 despite the GOP-controlled General Assembly having heavily redistricting the constituency after the 2020 U.S. Census. Then, she narrowly lost her 2024 bid for the statehouse seat to freshman Republican Rep. Vanessa Grossl, of Georgetown. The House Democratic Caucus elected Stevenson as its chair in 2022. Throughout her time in the legislature, Democrats held a minority in the House and Senate. 
Stevenson will hold a campaign kick-off Tuesday morning at Bluegrass Distillery in Midway. In a media advisory to reporters, Stevenson’s campaign highlighted her upbringing in Knott County in Southeastern Kentucky. She has lived in Lexington for about 25 years. The campaign said Stevenson “has devoted her life to the well-being and service of those in her immediate Central Kentucky community, her Eastern Kentucky heritage, and throughout the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky.”

So far, one Republican has announced plans to run for Barr’s seat — Kentucky Rep. Ryan Dotson, of Winchester. Dotson’s campaign kickoff is set for June 3 in his hometown. Of potential Republicans who may enter the race, he’s seen as one of the farthest to the political right and is making culture war issues a part of his campaign messaging, stressing his commitment to banning transgender women and girls from using women’s restrooms. 
Though Barr has held the U.S. House seat for over a decade, Democrats see the district as one they could flip heading in the midterm elections. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has said it considers the district is in play heading into midterm elections in 2026.
Kentucky is positioned to receive a lot of national attention during the midterm elections. Gov. Andy Beshear, who has not ruled out a 2028 bid for president, will serve as the chair of the Democratic Governors Association in 2026. That positions Beshear to rally support and money behind his party’s candidates across the nation in key elections. 
Some see the 6th Congressional District as a purple district. It includes Lexington, the state’s second largest city and one of Kentucky’s last remaining Democratic strongholds. However, Republicans regularly fare better in elections in the more rural and suburban parts of the district, such as Georgetown and Richmond. Barr easily won reelection in recent cycles with nearly two-thirds of the vote over little known and underfunded Democratic challengers. 
The Republican Party of Kentucky views the 6th Congressional District as a safe seat for the party. Spokesman Andy Westberry said in a statement that Stevenson’s “entry into this race isn’t a serious campaign; it’s a one-way ticket to political career-ending humiliation.” 
“Let’s be clear: the 6th District is Trump Country — rock-solid Republican ground where liberal pipe dreams go to die,” Westberry said. “If the DCCC thinks Cherlynn Stevenson is their ticket to a majority, they’re more delusional than we thought. This district will send another conservative fighter to Washington, and Democrats will be left wondering why they even bothered.”

(Photos courtesy of Jean Stothert for Omaha and John Ewing for Mayor | Omaha-Douglas City-County Building photo by Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Voters in Nebraska’s largest city, those who haven’t cast early ballots, hit the polls Tuesday to decide what kind of history the city should make, a fourth term for Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert or a first for Douglas County Treasurer John Ewing Jr.
Stothert started the five-way race this spring as a heavy favorite facing historical vulnerabilities common to Omaha mayors who seek to stay in office a long time. Some local political observers have worried she set herself up to learn the Hal Daub lesson.
Like Daub, Stothert has ruffled feathers among some in Omaha by unapologetically pressing her vision for the city, sometimes at odds with voters and donors. Daub faced pushback from voters and donors tired of his controversies and cantankerousness.
Voter fatigue vs. Name ID
Political scientists, consultants and politicians have said Stothert’s biggest challenges may be voter fatigue with a three-term mayor, unrest about the economy under President Donald Trump and the lack of a clearly articulated plan for a fourth term. 
Stothert’s GOP defenders say she easily advanced in an April primary with former State Sen. Mike McDonnell, a fellow Republican. But he softened Stothert with relentless criticism of her support of the city’s streetcar project and poor street quality. 
Ewing, a Democrat with a long history on local ballots as county treasurer, largely let them fight. He lost a close 2nd Congressional District race in 2012 with then-U.S. Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., in which he stressed competence and steadiness.
Stothert record
The mayor, a Republican running in the officially nonpartisan race, has argued that her record speaks for itself, that downtown Omaha, because of city partnerships with private donors and her work with businesses like Mutual of Omaha, is rebuilding stronger after the damage to the commercial real estate market from the COVID-19 pandemic.
She has argued that the city is safer because of the way she has worked with Police Chief Todd Schmaderer to pay police officers more and grow the budgeted number of officers the city can hire and help curb violence.
But McDonnell, a former Omaha fire chief, and Ewing, a former Omaha police officer, argued Stothert hasn’t done enough to help the city recruit and fill those new officer positions and, because of that, the city has neglected property and nuisance crimes.
Ewing’s pitch
Ewing would be the first Democrat to lead the city since former Mayor Jim Suttle, who helped revive the city’s finances with moves that upset some City Council conservatives, including implementing a restaurant tax that Stothert opposed and eventually accepted and has let stand as mayor.
If he beats Stothert, Ewing also would be the city’s first Black mayor, clearing a hurdle that former State Sen. Brenda Council of Omaha came closest to in 1997, losing narrowly to Daub. The Ewing campaign has pointed to Ewing’s record as a treasurer and as a high-ranking police officer. He was first elected treasurer in 2006.
Ewing and his campaign have said he is ready for the job and that he would focus the city more on the basics of providing city services, emphasizing improving roads, working with police and neighborhood groups to address crime, helping all of the city grow and boosting affordable housing.
Late attacks
Stothert’s camp has criticized miscalculations by his treasurer’s office in 2021 of how much to pay local school districts and governments based on funds from the Omaha Public Power District. A state audit found that the mistake led to incorrect payments to some local school districts and governments.
Late in the race, in an effort to overcome what looks like an advantage in energy and enthusiasm from local Democrats, some Stothert supporters have sought to force Ewing to discuss transgender rights, which has helped Republicans nationally. 
Ewing has argued that the move is a political distraction irrelevant to the job as mayor. Stothert, a former grand marshal of Omaha’s pride parade, has defended the ads as fair game given his party if Ewing and his supporters can lump her in with Trump, whom she has publicly supported.
Omaha’s election runs from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Early ballots can be turned in until polls close. Early ballots turned in by the close of business Monday will be counted on Election Day. Early ballots returned Tuesday will be opened and counted on Friday.

Minneapolis is among the cities forced to cancel vaccinations after cutoffs in federal funding. (Courtesy of City of Minneapolis)The number of measles cases is approaching 1,000 across 29 states, according to newly released federal statistics. Even as the outbreaks grow, more local governments are complaining that their efforts to combat measles with vaccination clinics have been shut down by abrupt federal funding cuts.
As of May 1, a total of 935 confirmed cases had been reported, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They were in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
There have been three confirmed deaths, two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all unvaccinated.
Metro Nashville, the combined county and city government in Tennessee, and three other local governments sued on April 24 over reductions in federal public health funding, saying the abrupt $11 billion in cuts nationwide forced Nashville to cancel vaccination clinics needed to combat this year’s measles outbreak. Colorado and a group of other states sued earlier in April, mentioning the impact of cuts on their ability to control measles, flu and other vaccine-preventable illnesses.
Others joining the April 24 lawsuit: Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri; and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. They called the cuts “a massive blow… at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.”
The funding cuts also forced Minneapolis to shut down clinics in March that had been scheduled to run through June, said Luisa Pessoa-Brandão, director of health initiatives for the city’s health department.
Last year the city’s clinics served 501 patients with 1,475 vaccination shots, including against measles, she said. About 30% of children in the city are not fully vaccinated, much too high to ensure unvaccinated children won’t fall victim to measles outbreaks like the current one, she added.
“There’s fear and hesitancy about the vaccine, based on some of the misinformation out there,” Pessoa-Brandão said. “There are other factors — access [to medical care] and the COVID pandemic, which delayed people getting vaccinations. We’re playing catch-up the last few years.”

Nearly five years ago, on May 19, 2020, the Edenville and Sanford Dams, located near Midland, failed due to record rainfall, forcing thousands of individuals to evacuate and causing catastrophic flooding and damage to property. 
The Edenville Dam’s former owner Lee Mueller was found liable for $119 million in environmental damage in a suit brought by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.
Days after the dam failed, a number of property owners took action against the DNR and EGLE, seeking compensation and arguing the departments’ actions contributed to the dam’s failure. The DNR and EGLE sought summary disposition on the grounds that there is no genuine issue of material fact within the complaint. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the Michigan Judicial Institute’ Civil Proceedings Benchbook,  a motion of this nature should not be filed until discovery is completed, however the motion may be granted when “there is no reasonable chance that further discovery will result in factual support for the nonmoving party.”
“The bottom line is, there’s some, limited albeit, but there is some expert discovery that’s continuing,” Redford said. 
Any further motions for summary disposition must be filed no later than July 3, 2025, with the court scheduled to hear arguments on those motions on Sept. 15, 2025. 
The DNR’s motion clearly created factual questions on whether EGLE was aware of the safety risk posed by the dam, Redford said, noting that the court’s task under the specific motion filed by the state is to determine whether an issue of material fact exists to warrant a trial.
“The opinion to deny [this motion for] relief is not an opinion which states the plaintiffs will win this case at trial. That’s not the standard. This case, if allowed to, will go to trial, and the trial court will have to weigh and evaluate the credibility of the evidence in a standard and in a manner which is far different from that in the [summary disposition] motion,” Redford said. 
Kevin Carlson, who represents the individuals impacted by the dam failure, was pleased with Redford’s decision, saying they would “finally have their day in court.”
“These plaintiffs have suffered unimaginable losses, and we are committed to holding the parties responsible accountable for their actions. For five years, the State of Michigan knew about the dam’s dangerous condition but refused to act in the best interests of the public and instead made the dam more dangerous by authorizing higher water levels. We look forward to pressing forward with this case and ensuring justice for those impacted by this catastrophic failure.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-13 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,A pill could end the HIV epidemic. Why do so few Mississippians take it?,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/13/prep-hiv-epidemic-mississippi/,Expanding access to PrEP is a national public health challenge. But Mississippi is the farthest behind the rest of the country in reaching people who could benefit from the medication.,"This story is part of “Uninsured in America,” a project led by Public Health Watch that focuses on life in America’s health coverage gap and the 10 states that haven’t expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
Jermany Gray worked up the nerve to ask his doctor about preventive medication for human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, at his last check-up before leaving Jackson to go to college. 
He knew that for someone like him – a young, Black, gay man living in Mississippi – the odds of acquiring HIV were alarmingly high. 
In 2016, when Gray was a sophomore in high school, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers estimated that if current HIV rates persisted, one in two Black gay or bisexual men would be diagnosed with the virus in their lifetime. 
As college approached, he wanted to take his health – and his future – into his own hands. He asked his doctor to prescribe him pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a highly effective medication that people who are not living with HIV can take to protect themselves from the virus. 
But she refused to write the prescription and instead recommended that he abstain from having sex. 
The bravery and excitement Gray had built up dissipated. “I kind of went back into my shell,” he said. 
Gray’s experience isn’t an anomaly. Thousands of Mississippians with risk factors for HIV don’t take PrEP due to insufficient provider education, lack of awareness, stigma, affordability and limited access to health care. 
Closing the gap
PrEP, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2012, blocks HIV from replicating in the body and has a 99% efficacy rate for preventing transmission by sex and a 74% efficacy rate for people who inject drugs, according to the CDC. 
Epidemiologists and public health experts agree that getting the medication into the hands of people who need it most is critical to curbing the domestic HIV epidemic, which drags on with over 35,000 new diagnoses each year – in spite of scientific advances in prevention and treatment. 
Expanding access to PrEP is a national public health challenge. But Mississippi is the farthest behind the rest of the country in reaching people who could benefit from the medication. 
“States that have made more progress in getting PrEP to the people who would benefit from it are the same states that have experienced greater declines in HIV diagnoses,” explains Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University whose research focuses on HIV prevention.
His research indicates that gaps in PrEP coverage are the most pronounced in states that have not expanded Medicaid – the policy intervention experts widely agree would be the most impactful intervention to increase PrEP coverage. 
Medicaid expansion would alleviate the cost concerns and barriers that prevent many low-income and uninsured people from accessing health care services, said Dr. Leandro Mena, a clinician-researcher with expertise in prevention of HIV who spent many years of his career in Mississippi and is currently a professor at Emory University. 
For over a decade, Mississippi has opted not to expand Medicaid to make health insurance available to more low-income adults in Mississippi. Expansion would result in 200,000 uninsured Mississippians gaining coverage and more low-income people seeking preventive care, said Khayla Scott, program manager for Mississippi Health Advocacy Program.
States that have expanded Medicaid are evidence of its impact, said Sullivan. His research shows that the number of PrEP users is 25% higher in states with Medicaid expansion, and 99% higher in states with PrEP drug assistance programs, or state-run programs to pay for medication and associated costs of care. 
“It suggests that there are policy options that improve access to PrEP and utilization of PrEP, and probably a lot of other preventive services,” Sullivan said.
For Gray, moving to Louisiana for college was a turning point in his journey to get on PrEP. There, he had a doctor that was willing to prescribe PrEP and instantly qualified for Medicaid coverage.

Getting on PrEP in Louisiana was “really forgettable, because it was that easy,” he said. 
Medicaid not only covered Gray’s medication, but also his quarterly labs and appointments, which can be expensive. Under federal law, Medicaid plans must cover preventive services like PrEP, clinic visits and lab tests with no cost sharing. 
Gray was able to get coverage because Louisiana expanded Medicaid in 2016, and while the state’s PrEP uptake, too, has been slower than the rest of the country, its rate of PrEP users is double that of Mississippi. The state has seen a noticeable drop in new HIV diagnoses since 2014.
When Gray returned to Mississippi after graduating, he found that accessing PrEP was again difficult – even with private insurance. His current plan doesn’t cover the name-brand PrEP he was previously prescribed, and he now has copays for the medication and routine testing. 
It is impossible to know how many HIV infections might have been prevented if PrEP was used more widely in Mississippi — or if the state had expanded Medicaid at any point since 2014, when it first became an option and two years after PrEP was approved for use. But Mississippi’s slower PrEP uptake compared to the rest of the country may have contributed to its modest decline in new HIV cases.
HIV rates have ticked downwards in the United States since the late 1990s. But cases remain especially high in the South, where half of all new HIV diagnoses occur each year, and where most states have not expanded Medicaid.Mississippi has remained in the top 10 states for HIV incidence for over a decade, and today about 10,000 Mississippians are living with HIV. The state’s new HIV diagnosis rates have fallen over the last two decades, but at a rate slower than the nation as a whole.
People living with HIV in Mississippi are the least likely in the country to receive timely care or achieve viral suppression, which can also contribute to higher transmission rates. Viral suppression means that the amount of the HIV virus in the body becomes undetectable, which keeps people healthy and prevents the transmission of HIV to others. 
Just 53% of Mississippians are connected to specialized HIV care within one month of their diagnosis, compared to a national average of 82%.
“We have so much work to do,” said Kendra Johnson, the director of communicable diseases at the Mississippi State Department of Health, who took the position last fall. 
‘The era of PrEP’
In 2011, June Gipson became the chief executive officer of My Brother’s Keeper, a HIV prevention and treatment nonprofit in Jackson. She could tell that the world of HIV advocacy was changing. 
“I knew things were different, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on what was happening,” she said. 
It wasn’t long before she pinpointed the shift: “the era of PrEP” had arrived. 
The behavioral HIV prevention interventions My Brother’s Keeper had focused on – “condoms and comfort,” and “testing and hand-holding,” in Gipson’s words – were no longer the most effective methods for preventing HIV, leading the organization to launch Open Arms Healthcare Center, one of the state’s largest PrEP providers, in 2013.

The University of Mississippi Medical Center, another major provider of PrEP and HIV care and the state’s safety net hospital, declined to grant Mississippi Today an interview with the medical director of the hospital’s adult special care clinic, which offers HIV treatment and preventive services.
PrEP usage has accelerated fifty-fold across the country in the last decade, surpassing half a million people who take the medication. 
Mississippi, too, has seen improved uptake. Since 2018, the number of PrEP users in Mississippi has nearly tripled, reaching 1,800 users. 
But a statistic that estimates whether the medication is reaching the people who need it shows Mississippi still lags behind other states. 
Researchers studying HIV prevention compare the number of people who take PrEP with the number of new diagnoses in a population – called a “PrEP-to-need” ratio – to identify whether the medication is being equitably distributed across geographic areas and groups. A high PrEP-to-need ratio indicates that PrEP is being utilized well, while a low PrEP-to-need ratio suggests that a population has less adequate coverage. 
The PrEP-to-need ratio in the United States is 13, meaning that for every new HIV diagnosis, there are 13 people who take PrEP. But in Mississippi, the PrEP-to-need ratio is four, demonstrating the lowest coverage rates compared to need in the entire country. 
And data shows that even within Mississippi, PrEP is not reaching all communities equally.  
Black Mississippians are diagnosed with HIV at a rate five times that of white residents, while Hispanic Mississippians face rates four times higher. But together, Black and Hispanic Mississippians make up only 54% of PrEP users in the state. 
And among Black and Hispanic Mississippians, just two people take PrEP for each new diagnosis, demonstrating a notable racial disparity in access to the medication. 
Will Holt, the special populations program manager at Coastal Family Health Center, a federally-qualified health center in Biloxi, said he sees this discrepancy reflected in his clients. Most of his white patients are receiving PrEP, while most of his patients living with HIV are Black. 
“It is very disheartening,” he said. 
Serving communities equitably isn’t only an issue of fairness, said Sullivan, the Emory professor who studies HIV prevention. It’s important to focus PrEP in the places where it will be most impactful to halt the spread of HIV. 
“We have the tools that we need to end the HIV epidemic now,” he said. 
Barriers to access
Experts say that Mississippi’s high HIV rates and low PrEP uptake are steeped in the same barriers that thwart many Mississippians’ access to health care – poverty, rurality, racism, poor public health infrastructure and high uninsurance rates – all of which are linked to being a state without Medicaid expansion.
“Many of the communities at highest risk for acquiring HIV have more limited access to the health care system,” explains Sullivan. 
The systemic barriers that prevent people from accessing care are then also worsened by the stigma that surrounds HIV and a lack of education about PrEP and HIV among patients and providers alike that prevents people from accessing care.
Although primary care providers can prescribe PrEP, many don’t — often due to a lack of training or familiarity with the medication. 
Many providers are uncomfortable discussing sexual health with their patients, which prevents important conversations about sexual activity and HIV testing and prevention options from occurring, said Mena, the clinician-researcher and Emory University professor.

“I don’t think we’ve trained our health care professionals adequately to really overcome the cultural challenges that we grew up with in a society where sex is something that we don’t talk about,” he said. 
Advocates say that a lack of patient awareness of PrEP can also prevent important conversations between patients and providers from occurring. Mississippi’s sexual education law allows schools to teach an abstinence-only curriculum, which does not include information about HIV prevention methods beyond abstinence.
Many Mississippi students come to college without any sexual health education, said Maggie White, a nurse practitioner at First Horizons Health Center in Starkville, where Mississippi State University, one of the state’s largest public universities, is located. During appointments, she often finds herself focusing attention on teaching students about safe sex and condom use. 
“They don’t know anything (about sexual health),” she said. “…They’ll come in for sinus stuff, and then start asking other questions.”
A lack of representation in messaging about HIV can also play a role in the dearth of education about PrEP. Many people assume based on advertisements for PrEP that it is a drug exclusively for gay men, which can lead them to feel like it isn’t for them, said Holt. 
“It takes time and a lot of education to address biases that exist both in the provider side but also in the consumer side,” said Mena. 
‘A major setback’
In 2019, President Donald Trump unveiled a national initiative to quell the domestic HIV epidemic by 2030 by pumping millions of dollars to areas with high infection rates, choosing Mississippi as one target area. Increasing access to PrEP was one of the cornerstones of the plan.  
To meet the administration’s lofty goals, the state would have to reduce its new diagnoses by 75% in five years and 90% in a decade. 
New diagnoses in Mississippi crept down 5% in the first three years of reported data – far from keeping pace with federal goals. Other states, too, struggled to keep up as COVID-19 spread across the country. 
The Mississippi State Department of Health published its plan to accomplish these objectives in 2021, laying out detailed strategies for increasing PrEP access. Goals for the first year of the plan included routine HIV testing for Medicaid recipients, the creation of a statewide education campaign to discuss the availability of PrEP and hiring staff to train clinicians at high-volume clinics. 
But the state’s efforts to increase PrEP coverage as a part of the initiative were stalled for years as an understaffed public health department struggled to battle the COVID-19 pandemic and skyrocketing syphilis cases.
The health department saw a 10% decline in staffing capacity from 2021 to 2022, according to data from the Mississippi State Personnel Board. 
The agency’s HIV division was left “severely understaffed” as a result, said Johnson, the current director of the program. 
And a recent report by Mississippi’s State Auditor Shad White alleged that from 2021 to 2024, the health department distributed hundreds of thousands of dollars in grant money the state received as a part of the federal initiative to curb HIV with little oversight, approving questionable purchases and continued payments even as the nonprofits performed few of the HIV tests they were tasked with administering. 
The agency could not produce monthly reports for the grant activities or documentation of hundreds of thousands of dollars of expenses, the report said.
Last fall, the HIV division found its footing again and hired new leadership, according to agency officials and community-based organizations that work with the department. With increased staffing capacity and a “recommitment” to HIV, the health department is again turning to the state’s plan and hopes to make updates to it in coming months.

But just as the state’s response to HIV efforts was beginning to regain traction, the Trump administration took office, cutting or destabilizing federal grants the state depended on for prevention efforts.
Some community-based organizations in Mississippi have not been able to offer HIV testing since last year due to a federal grant transition that was first delayed by the health department and then by a breakdown in communication between the agency and the CDC, said Johnson. 
This lapse caused Open Arms’ Gulfport clinic, which depended on the grant to provide services to patients, to shut its doors in February. 
“We held on as long as we could,” said Gipson. 
Dozens of HIV-related federal research grants were abruptly axed in March by the Trump administration, including a $1 million grant to My Brother’s Keeper that studied health services that automatically link patients with HIV risk factors to PrEP. The University of Mississippi Medical Center, University of Southern Mississippi and the State Department of Health were all partners on the project. 
Cuts to COVID-19 pandemic relief funding for public health efforts have also impacted the state’s public health infrastructure and have ended free STI testing at county health departments. And the federal government froze millions of dollars in grants to the state’s Title X family planning recipient, which administers HIV prevention and testing services in Mississippi. 
But these cuts may just be the beginning. 
President Trump’s preliminary budget request for fiscal year 2026 suggests that federal HIV prevention efforts may be scaled back or eliminated. The CDC – which is the hub for domestic HIV prevention and distributes most of its prevention funding to state and local jurisdictions – would see its funding cut in half. 
If federal funding for HIV prevention is cut, it would be difficult for Mississippi’s health department, which is 66% federally funded, to make up the difference.
Advocates fear that if these cuts take effect, the progress Mississippi has made – slowly but surely – to get PrEP to more people, ensure that people are aware of their HIV status and lower new HIV infection rates, will be lost. 
“If that happens, or when that happens, it’s going to be a major setback to everything that we have been able to achieve,” said Mena. 
And Mississippians will bear the burden. Funding cuts for HIV prevention efforts in Mississippi will undoubtedly lead to a rise in HIV infections, Gipson said. 
“We’re turning back the hands of time.”

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”










As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.

But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”

Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

Jim Justice (R-WV) speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on March 25, 2025 in Washington, DC (Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images)“I’ve joined 25 other Republican governors in supporting President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Initiative. The goal is to streamline government, cut wasteful spending, and balance the federal budget. Let’s make it happen.” — West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice
Sen. Jim Justice was once a billionaire, although now estimates of his wealth vary. Raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy (like President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Justice) is not politically feasible due to lack of support from GOP politicians, like Justice. Therefore, balancing the budget means spending less.
On Dec. 5, 2024, Musk sent out a tweet that I agree with 100%: “Shouldn’t the American people be getting their money’s worth?”
However, for Musk to have credibility, he must address budget cutting in a targeted, bipartisan, rational way.
He has not done so, which caused Justice to later state, “It is impossible to not mow past the fence in some areas… you’re going to have to adjust.” But Justice and his GOP colleagues have done nothing to stop Musk or Trump.
The key to DOGE (Musk’s Department of Governmental Efficiency) being successful — which we should all hope for — is prioritizing. Musk must change course and choose easy targets which show that he is serious and selfless, a tough issue for both Musk and his boss. Especially when Congress, including Justice, sits on its hands.
Health care spending and waste is a big problem for U.S. and West Virginia taxpayers. So is health delivery. Our mortality and morbidity rates are worse than other democracies and West Virginia is near the bottom on most measures. Plus, we pay much more than any of these democracies, with much of it coming from our federal and state taxes. Data provided illustrates that the U.S. spends $1,055 per capita on health care administrative costs. The average OECD (developed nation) spends only $194.
As a health care professional, it is obvious to me why that is so. We have a convoluted multi-payer system in the U.S., the only nation so disorganized. Physicians for a National Health Plan (PNHP), with 20,000 members (including me), has been advocating for a single payer system for several decades.
But lobbyist money from Big Pharma and Big Insurance has made this topic a third rail for supposedly fiscally conservative politicians like Justice. So, DOGE has not advocated the obvious solution to excessive administrative costs in the U.S. health care system-single payer. Neither has Congress under blue or red control.
Also, it is a fact that much of Musk’s wealth comes from two firms — Tesla and Space X, both of which rely on money coming from the federal government, directly or indirectly. So, what should DOGE examine as another priority on the hit list? If Musk is serious, it should be NASA.
I love Star Trek as much as anyone, but the federal government’s return on investment (ROI) is extremely low. And federal funding for Space X, worth $210 billion and Musk owns 40% of it, is coming from NASA which our taxes fund. Since 2008, Space X has gotten $20 billion in U.S. tax dollars, including nearly $4 billion last year. Cutting funding gives Musk immediate credibility across the aisle and with the American public. Why isn’t Justice advocating for that?
Here is what NASA states regarding its benefits to taxpayers — “Dollars spent for space exploration create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. Our innovations improve daily life, advance medical research, support disaster response, and more.” Let’s examine their vague, idealistic statement in more detail.
Our Star Trek, excuse me, I mean NASA, budget totals over $25 billion of our federal tax dollars. That figure includes nearly $8 billion for moon exploration (Artemis), over $4 billion for items related to the International Space Station, over $1 billion for space technology (Moon to Mars), nearly $8 billion for general space exploration, and over $2 billion for research related to earth science and climate control.
What would be the negative effect of cutting NASA funding in half? NASA would say that it would cut job creation, business profits and negatively impact the economy. Undoubtedly, that is true. But it is also true for any federal cost-cutting measures, and slashing NASA will have few real negative effects on our lives.
Unless DOGE prioritizes and uses a scalpel versus a chain saw, and addresses NASA, it will be ridiculed. As well it should be, Sen. Justice.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)As the White House and Congress weigh difficult budget decisions, Kentuckians are watching closely, especially those of us who work to address the opioid and overdose epidemic. Proposed federal cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) threaten to dismantle the programs responsible for a 30% reduction in overdose deaths in Kentucky over the past year.
On May 1, Gov. Andy Beshear announced that overdose deaths in the commonwealth decreased for the third year in a row, with a 30.2% decrease in 2024 over the previous year.
Fatal overdoses decreased among Black Kentucky residents from 271 in 2023 to 170 in 2024 — a 37.3% decrease that reversed a recent trend.
According to the 2024 Kentucky Drug Overdose Fatality Report, 1,410 Kentuckians lost their lives last year to a drug overdose.
In 2023, Kentucky reported a 9.8% decrease compared with 2022. In 2022, there was a decrease of 2.5% from 2021, marking the first year Kentucky saw a decrease in overdose deaths since 2018. By working together, the governor said, Kentucky is saving lives. He credited the state’s continued decline in overdose deaths to several factors including:

More than $29.7 million was distributed in grant and pass-through funding from the Office of Drug Control Policy;
170,000 doses of Narcan were distributed;
84 syringe exchange program sites served 27,799 unique participants;
More than 17,390 Kentuckians received addiction treatment paid for by the Kentucky Opioid Response Effort;
More than 17,980 Kentuckians received recovery services (housing assistance, employment services, transportation, basic need services, etc.) in their community paid for by the Kentucky Opioid Response Effort;
19 Kentuckians sought treatment through the Kentucky State Police Angel Initiative;
More than 3,320 incoming calls were made to the KY HELP Call Center with more than 14,080 outgoing follow up calls,
 And 21 counties are now certified as Recovery Ready Communities representing nearly 1.5 million Kentuckians.

As the leaders of People Advocating Recovery and the Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy, we have seen the impact of this crisis firsthand — and we have seen the transformative impact of smart investments from public safety and recovery organizations working hand in hand for overdose prevention, treatment and recovery. 
Let us be clear: we strongly support responsible governance. Government efficiency, fiscal discipline and strategic workforce development are essential for a thriving nation. But these proposed cuts, particularly to frontline recovery and public health services, will not achieve those outcomes; they will undermine them.
The proposed restructuring of HHS would eliminate approximately 20,000 federal jobs within that agency, including layoffs within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). These are the very institutions leading our nation’s response to addiction and mental health. Weakening them now is like pulling fire crews off duty during wildfire season, while the fire is still smoldering.
Equally alarming are reports that Congress is weighing as much as $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade. These cuts would devastate the already strained safety net especially in rural areas, like Appalachia, leading to hospital closures, spikes in ER use and inevitably increased incarceration of people with untreated behavioral health needs.
Cutting essential recovery infrastructure is not a pathway to economic stability. In fact, it threatens the very workforce development efforts policymakers want to prioritize. We cannot grow the economy by sidelining millions of Americans who are in or seeking recovery in the midst of this crisis. Instead, we must invest in them. When people recover, they return to work, support their families, contribute to their communities and economy.
This is not the time to abandon our efforts to end this deadly public health crisis. Now is the time to reaffirm our promise to curb addiction, save families and children, and erode this deadly disease once and for all. Kentucky and the nation have made great progress, it’s time we turn that progress into prosperity for all and make recovery a national priority.

(Courtesy photo from the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority)Rhode Island FC has yet to notch a home-field victory since its May 3 home opener ended in a tie at its new Pawtucket stadium, but the cash-strapped Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) is calling its new partnership with the state’s only professional soccer team a win for fans and bus riders.
Under an agreement signed in late April and obtained by Rhode Island Current, the bus agency will provide fare-free rides on six buses operating during home games at Centreville Bank Stadium through the end of 2027, along with other select events at the stadium. The stadium is scheduled to host 18 home games in 2025 — 15 United Soccer League regular season matches and three cup games.
“No monetary compensation will be exchanged,” states the memorandum of understanding between the team and the bus agency, now facing a projected $32.6 million budget deficit due to federal pandemic relief aid drying up.
But RIPTA has confirmed it will receive $150,000 in courtesy advertising from the deal.
“Rhode Island Football Club provides a unique opportunity for RIPTA to draw new ridership,” agency spokesperson Sara Furbush said in an email.
RIPTA’s partnership with Rhode Island FC runs through Dec. 31, 2027, though the team has the option to opt out in 2026. But so far the team has no complaints since its May 3 home debut ended in a 0-0 draw before the soldout crowd of 10,700 spectators.
Nathan Robillard, Rhode Island FC’s communications specialist, said the team is happy with RIPTA’s game day bus service. “If we’re asking people to park a mile away from the stadium, we want to give them a way there for free,” he said.
More than 9,500 spectators attended the following home game May 7, when Rhode Island FC lost 2-1 to the New England Revolution in the U.S. Open Cup’s Round of 32. The third home game on May 10 ended with a tie 2-2.
A little more than 1,500 riders used the stadium route loop during the first two matches at Centreville Bank Stadium, according to RIPTA.

‘Smart for both parties’
Alec Beckett, a strategic partner at NAIL Communications in Providence, called the collaboration between RIPTA and the soccer team a “win-win.” NAIL designed Rhode Island FC’s logo.
Beckett said RIPTA likely faces little overhead since it already owns its buses while the team only had to put up some signs inside the stadium — along with guaranteeing space for the occasional broadcast ad.
“It’s kind of smart for both parties,” Beckett said. “They’re both giving something of value.”
Under the agreement, Rhode Island FC will provide the agency with two live TV reads per local telecast on myRITV and the New England Sports Network for 17 games, along with one 30-second commercial per game. A similar arrangement for radio broadcasts is valid for 18 games.
Broadcast ads are still in development, Furbush said.
Digitally, the team will promote RIPTA’s game day service on its website, along with banners on each of Rhode Island FC’s “Know Before You Go” emails and monthly e-newsletters.
Rhode Island FC must also provide RIPTA with in-stadium signage at each home game, including three minutes of field display through an LED board, one static board, and two concourse ribbon signs.
The team’s partnership pamphlet boasts the newly opened Centreville Bank Stadium as the largest such outdoor venue in Rhode Island, which presents “an incredibly unique opportunity for high-impact branding.” 
Rhode Island FC projects 300,000 visitors coming through the gates annually, with 85% of fans described as likely to support club advertisers.
Such a prospect of new riders has public transit advocate John Flaherty excited over this new partnership for RIPTA.
“They need to be nimble like that when there are opportunities,” Flaherty, a senior adviser for GrowSmart RI, said in an interview. “Many of the people who jump on the loop are probably people who would not otherwise have set foot on a bus, but for their desire to get to the stadium.”
In return for added eyeballs on its branding, RIPTA has covered three buses in its fleet with Rhode Island FC-branded wraps, at a cost of $20,400 to create and install, Furbish said. Full bus wraps typically cost advertisers between $5,040 to $6,000 every four weeks depending on the length of a campaign, according to the 2025 rate card from Vector Media, the New York company which handles ads for RIPTA.

The game day line is an extension of the existing R-Line, funded through reimbursements from the Federal Highway Administration’s Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program, which connects Cranston, Providence and Pawtucket. The standard fare to ride the bus is $2. Waiving that usual fee helps make the game day service easier for RIPTA drivers to manage, Furbush said.
Labor cost for the first game day service was around $2,661, Furbush said.
Buses run from three hours before kickoff until one hour after postgame events end. Buses operate on an eight to 10-minute loop between stops, with the final drop-off at Ivan Perez Memorial Park, about a two-minute walk from the stadium.
RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand said the partnership with Rhode Island FC is a great opportunity for growth. 
“Tens of thousands of people will be trying transit for the first time, and in doing so, (be) attracted to ride in the future,” Durand said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “Riders will use RIPTA beyond the downtown Pawtucket route to access the game in the easiest way possible.”
Rhode Island FC’s next home game is scheduled May 24, when the club will host the Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC.

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
The most likely Medicaid cuts would hit rural areas the hardest

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”

(Photo: Lynn Bonner)Over the last several decades, few initiatives of the American political right have met with greater sustained success than the relentless crusade to capture control of the courts. The U.S. Supreme Court’s reactionary majority is, of course, the ultimate and most visible example of this success, but the ongoing effort to politicize and radicalize the judiciary has borne fruit in many places.
See, for example, the appellate courts in North Carolina where, thanks to the investment of big dollars and a whatever-it-takes-to-win approach to campaigning, Republicans have captured sizable majorities on the state’s Supreme Court (5-2) and Court of Appeals (11-4).
By spending millions of dollars and waging a determined and unabashed culture-war-based ground game that has helped spur conservative voters to action in bottom-of-the-ballot races that once were treated as nonpartisan, the GOP has transformed the state appellate courts through a series of narrow electoral wins into a rubber stamp for its gerrymandered legislative majorities.
And while progressives have tried to push back periodically, they’ve mostly found themselves in a defensive posture and promoting bland messages like “let’s keep the courts fair” or “we need judges who will respect the Constitution” – themes that are true and accurate enough, but that were never capable of firing up the troops.
And then along came Jefferson Griffin.
Six months ago, millions of Democratic- and progressive-leaning North Carolinians had only the vague idea of how the state’s courts were organized – much less the identities of the people who serve on them. Incumbent Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs was a mostly anonymous jurist – well-known only among the state’s small cadre of civil rights and civil liberties lawyers of which she was once a member.
Today, thanks to Griffin’s ill-conceived and politically disastrous effort to overturn his loss to Riggs in last November’s state Supreme Court election by tossing thousands of ballots, everything has changed.
Conservative pundits and pols may be spinning the brave face notion that Griffin’s failed challenge helped advance the cause of “voter integrity” – that is, identifying new categories of voters on whom Republicans can impose new roadblocks to voting – and one suspects that’s something they will pursue.
But by far the biggest and most important impact of Griffin’s failed effort is the transformative boost it’s given to progressives and Democrats in awakening them to the importance of judicial elections.
Indeed, a lot of Republican and conservative operatives are likely kicking themselves right now, or at least, Griffin. Had he quietly conceded last November after a second recount confirmed his defeat, it would have been a disappointment for the right, but hardly a defeat of great consequence.
Republicans would have still maintained their large majority on the high court and most North Carolinians would have quickly forgotten about the contest.
Today, however, after six months of dreadful nationwide publicity for Griffin in which he was rightfully portrayed as a sore loser, along with six months of unprecedented organizing and messaging by dozens of progressive good government advocates and advocacy groups, the visibility of the state courts is dramatically different.
Meanwhile, Justice Riggs has emerged as a minor political rock star.
Thanks to her willingness to abandon the traditional tight-lipped posture of Democratic judicial candidates by stepping out and running a very public campaign to rally public support for her legal argument to count all the votes that were cast, Riggs, in effect, beat the right at its own game.
For the first time in recent memory, a young, progressive Democratic judge presented herself as (and spoke to average people like) a real person with whom they could easily identify – not just a distant and vaguely mysterious figure in judicial robes voicing sober legal platitudes.
It’s no wonder that other Democratic judicial candidates are already lining up to invite her to headline their campaign fundraisers.
And, of course, for Democrats and other progressives looking to alter North Carolina’s political environment by breaking Republicans’ gerrymandered strangleholds on the legislature and U.S. House delegation, all of this news could scarcely have come at a better time.
At the heart of the GOP gerrymandering success is the party’s control of the state Supreme Court. If Democrats are to have any hope of seeing fair redistricting maps return to North Carolina – maps that would reflect a state that, as the Riggs-Griffin election demonstrated in stark terms, is evenly divided between the two major parties – they’ll have to end the current GOP dominance of the high court. And that will necessitate winning elections in 2026, 2028 and 2030, prior to the next scheduled round of redistricting in 2031.
Whether Democrats can capitalize on their recent good fortune in those upcoming elections remains, of course, very much an open question. Notwithstanding the outrage and enthusiasm of recent months, voter memories can be short, and it’s a sure thing that that big GOP dollars and hardball tactics aren’t going anywhere.
For now, though, the chance that Democrats can reverse recent patterns in judicial elections looks much brighter than it did at this time last year. And all those concerned can thank Jefferson Griffin for the sea change.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_4337-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-13 06:04:17.612046

(Tom Werner/Getty Images)Could ultrasound technology help better target cancer treatments? University of Virginia researcher Natash Sheybani recently received a $5.5 million dollar grant that can help her, and her team, answer that question. 
As the research director at UVA’s Focused Ultrasound Cancer Immunotherapy Center, the grant from the federal Department of Defense will help support Sheybani and her team’s research into the potential of focused ultrasound to improve the safety and precision of immunotherapy drugs for cancer patients. 
While Sheybani said medical research professionals often focus intensely on the science of their work, she feels that physical and emotional insights from cancer patients and their loved ones will also be crucial to her team as they dig into the nitty gritty of the science. 
“Something we’re trying to do consciously in my lab is pulling in the voices of people who have themselves been diagnosed with cancer, those who have survived or those who have been caregivers to others who understand the (burdens of the disease),” Sheybani said. “I think those voices are so important, because they really do end up kind of dictating what is necessary, what is realistic, what is worthwhile.”
While ultrasound technology may be able to help more effectively target cancer, resulting in more positive survival prognoses, Sheybani also emphasized how it can lessen the “harsh” effects treatment can have on people overall. 
For metastatic breast cancer in particular, only about a third of patients live past five years from their diagnosis and it is incurable. But treatments like chemotherapy, radiation and surgeries can help slow its spread. For chemo and radiation, there’s also heightened risks of targeting healthy tissue. 
“Breast cancer therapies are still very harsh and we leave a lot of room for off-target toxicity and impacts that can have downstream impact on long-term quality of life,” Sheybani said.  
That’s where ultrasound technology comes in. From heating up cancerous cells to break them down to sending sonic cues that can help medications penetrate better, Sheybani’s work at UVA builds on prior related research she has been a part of. 
She added that her team also plans to focus on brain cancers and pancreatic cancers — two organs that can be challenging to treat. For the brain in particular, she said a membrane known as the blood-brain barrier makes it difficult for therapeutic drugs to enter in sufficient quantities. And of course, brain surgeries come with risks and duress on the body. Ultrasound could  bolster treatments and in some cases help to avoid surgery, she said. 
“You’re talking about basically an incisionless procedure, which you can kind of directly juxtapose with how invasive and cumbersome things like an open surgery might be,” Sheybani explained. 
An alum of Virginia Commonwealth University and UVA, Sheybani went on to work on her post-doctoral research at Stanford before being recruited back to her alma mater. It’s a happy homecoming, she said, as she aspires to improve cancer treatments and the patient experience. 
“I’ve had the good fortune in my career to kind of get in on the ground floor of … these developments that have definitely allowed me to stay in this community of people who are really dedicated to advancing this topic in a way that we hope will be really meaningful for patient outcomes,” Sheybani said.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., is backing bipartisan legislation aimed at helping workers as young as 18 — particularly those who enter the workforce straight out of high school — gain access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, a benefit many currently don’t receive until age 21.
On Monday, Kaine, a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, teamed up with HELP Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, R-La., to reintroduce the Helping Young Americans Save for Retirement Act. The bill seeks to eliminate regulatory and financial barriers that discourage employers from offering retirement benefits to younger employees, a gap that disproportionately affects low-income and non-college-bound workers.
“Contributing to a retirement plan early on sets people up for financial security in the future,” Kaine said. “I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan bill that would ensure younger workers have access to their employer-sponsored retirement benefits when they are starting out in their careers.”
Under existing federal law, employers who offer 401(k) or other defined contribution plans are only required to make them available to workers 21 and older. While companies can voluntarily lower the participation age, many don’t, citing the cost and complexity of compliance under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 
A 2021 report by the Plan Sponsor Council of America found that 40% of employers restrict retirement access to workers under 21, leaving many younger employees without the chance to begin building savings during their first years in the workforce.
“Americans who don’t attend college and immediately enter the workforce should be given every chance to save for retirement,” Cassidy said in a statement. “This legislation empowers American workers, giving them more opportunities to plan for a secure retirement.”
The proposed legislation would require employers to open their retirement plans to eligible employees beginning at age 18. It would also delay ERISA audit requirements that are triggered when younger workers are added and exempt those employees from certain retirement fund testing mandates that increase administrative costs for employers.
Advocates for the legislation argue that starting retirement contributions even a few years earlier can significantly improve long-term outcomes, thanks to the power of compound interest. The proposal has drawn endorsements from a wide range of organizations, including the Insured Retirement Institute, Edward Jones, TIAA, LPL, the American Benefits Council and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.
“The Helping Young Americans Save for Retirement Act will expand the opportunity for more younger workers to start saving earlier for retirement by allowing them to participate in their employer-sponsored workplace plans,” said Paul Richman, chief government and political affairs officer at the Insured Retirement Institute. 
“This measure will not only help younger workers get into the habit of contributing to their retirement savings, but it will also provide additional years for their savings to grow to ensure a more secure financial future.”
The bill builds on a similar measure introduced in 2023 and reflects broader Democratic efforts to expand access to financial tools for working-class Americans. It also aligns with Kaine’s long-standing emphasis on workforce development and economic opportunity — particularly for those who do not follow a traditional college path.
The proposal now awaits consideration by the full Senate.

Hampton Roads continues to see rising tides linked to climate change and sinking land.
But the rate of change in recent years has stayed in line with past forecasts, according to the latest “sea level rise report card” from William & Mary’s Batten School and Virginia Institute of Marine Science.
“We are accelerating at a high rate compared to a lot of the rest of the country, but that rate hasn’t been changing, really,” said Molly Mitchell, an assistant research professor. “It’s been a pretty consistent rate.”
She said that can give local leaders more confidence in using current data for long-term planning on adapting infrastructure to rising waters.
VIMS started releasing the annual report card in 2018 to assess how coastal cities across the U.S. are experiencing sea level rise.
“You hear about sea level changes that are kind of a global rate, but what’s happening at any given place is a combination of a lot of different factors,” Mitchell said.
For example, southeastern Virginia is sinking twice as fast as sea level is rising, compounding the issue. That’s largely because of the land naturally adjusting to the retreat of ancient glaciers, as well as humans pulling groundwater from the Potomac aquifer.
In other areas, the opposite is happening because of cities’ locations along tectonic plates or differing ocean currents, Mitchell said.
The researchers used data from tide gauges in three dozen communities along the West, East and Gulf coasts, including Yorktown and Norfolk.
Most locations showed continued acceleration. That includes Hampton Roads, where water levels crept up by about 5.6 millimeters each year over the past five years.
The Gulf Coast is experiencing the fastest acceleration, such as in Texas and Louisiana.
On the East Coast, Norfolk has long been a hotspot. But Mitchell said one interesting trend is happening farther south.
Tidal data suggests the hotspot is moving south with high rates of acceleration in areas such as Charleston, South Carolina and Wilmington, North Carolina.
“They’re still lower than Norfolk, but maybe they’re starting to slowly catch up,” Mitchell said.
One likely reason is that the southern coasts are disproportionately impacted by the melting of the Greenland ice sheet because of a complex dynamic involving ocean temperatures and currents.
If the next 30 years are similar to the past few decades, Mitchell said Hampton Roads can expect a little more than 1.5 feet of sea level rise by 2050, as compared to 1992 levels. Some global climate models put that number closer to 3 feet.
Mitchell said though it sounds insignificant, she compares the situation to standing on a beach and trying to avoid getting your feet wet.
“You look out and see a wave coming in that’s a foot higher than the other waves,” she said. “You find you actually have to back up probably like 10 feet even though that wave is just a foot higher. What we have in Virginia is a lot of really low, flat land. So a small change in the height of the water can mean a lot more flooding.”

The next step is for the state ballot board to determine whether the proposal includes a single constitutional amendment or multiple amendments. The board has ten days to make that determination.
In Ohio, property taxes fund basic services including schools, emergency services, parks, libraries and local governments. But hostility toward property taxes has been growing — particularly among conservatives.
The proposal and its supporters
The group Citizens for Property Tax Reform has advanced the proposal and its text is remarkably simple. It creates a new section in the state constitution stating, “no real property shall be taxed, and no law shall impose any taxes on real property.” It goes on to define “real property” as land, crops, buildings and other permanent improvements.
The amendment’s summary is longer than the actual text that would be added to the state constitution.
The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to Citizens for Property Tax Reform, but the group did not immediately respond. In a recent Facebook post, the group downplayed criticisms.
It acknowledged some believe the proposal is “extreme” but “We feel its extreme to tax a homeowner unrealized gains.” Citizens for Property Tax Reform argued the real problem is “out of control spending at all levels in government” and it’s “flat out wrong and disgusting” for a homeowner to wind up getting taxed out of their home.
With Yost’s approval, the only hurdle standing in the way of supporters collecting signatures is the Ohio Ballot Board’s green light. Once they begin circulating petitions, organizers will need to gather about 413,000 signatures (10% of turnout in the most recent governor’s race), and they’ll have to clear at least 5% of gubernatorial turnout in 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties.

Conservative enthusiasm
In a speech announcing his candidacy for governor, Vivek Ramaswamy argued for eliminating income taxes before adding, “we need to bring down property taxes in this state immediately — eventually down to zero.”
Both arguments are a recurring feature in Ramaswamy’s stump speech, but he’s walked the property tax argument back somewhat. He still insists that homeowners paying as much in taxes as they do in principal and interest is “unjust,” “un-American” and little more than “a lease from the government,” but now he promises a statewide cap on the percentage of property that can be assessed for taxes.
Notably, Ohio already does that. Property taxes only apply to 35% of a property’s appraised value. Ohio Capital Journal asked Ramaswamy’s campaign to elaborate on his approach and what he makes of the constitutional amendment. The campaign did not respond.
Ramaswamy appears to be tapping into a rhetorical current that’s having a bit of a moment. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis offered a different version of Ramaswamy’s lease argument.
“To say that someone that’s been in their house for 35 years just has to keep ponying up money,” DeSantis argued, “You don’t own your home, if that’s the case.”
“If I go to Best Buy and buy a flat screen TV and put it on the wall,” he added, “I’ve got to pay a sales tax on it, right? I don’t keep paying tax on it every year.”

— Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) May 9, 2025

Florida lawmakers want to put a property tax repeal amendment on the ballot in 2026. DeSantis has voiced support for the idea. In Pennsylvania, too, a lawmaker has proposed a constitutional amendment abolishing property taxes. Those changes wouldn’t take effect until 2030.
Is that a good idea?
Closer to home, Ohio House lawmakers have advanced a budget rider capping the funding school districts can carry over year to year in a bid to provide immediate property tax cuts. And several interest groups are insisting now is the moment for property tax reductions.
Many Ohioans have a lot less slack in their budgets following a historic spike of inflation. Meanwhile home values have kept climbing. A calculator from the Federal Housing Finance Agency indicates a $100,000 home purchased in Ohio five years ago would’ve gained an estimated 62% in value. As auditors reappraise properties, increasing tax bills are pushing some homeowners to the brink.
Still, even those calling for changes worry eliminating property taxes outright would cause more problems than it would solve.
Why you could see more school levies in Ohio’s future

Greg Lawson from the conservative-leaning Buckeye Institute explained “reform is absolutely essential,” but warned there’s no quick fix. Too many bills lawmakers are discussing nibble around the edges instead of making structural changes, he said.
As an example, Lawson argued too many entities can put levies on the ballot, creating a “pancaking effect” over time. He agrees with the amendment’s supporters that local governments need to be more efficient, but outside of property tax, the only options on the table are sales and income taxes.
“Even if you cut back on some of the local spending to make it more efficient, which is, in long run, a good thing to do,” Lawson said, “it would still mean you’re going to have exorbitantly high sales or income taxes. Either that or you don’t get the service — it’s really that simple.”
The Ohio Taxpayer Protection Coalition, backed by the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, realtors and county auditors, wants lawmakers to come up with a new version of a tax fix from the 1970s. That approach reduced tax rates as home values rose, but home values have risen so high that some counties can’t reduce rates further. Coalition Chairman Tom Zaino did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the proposed amendment.
Left-leaning Policy Matters Ohio doesn’t often see eye to eye with the Buckeye Institute — particularly when it comes to taxes. But Bailey Williams agreed that Ohioans need property tax relief, and the proposed amendment is counterproductive. He called the idea “fiscally irresponsible” and said it “would devastate local public goods and services across Ohio.”
A particular challenge, he argued, is that reductions in state income taxes means there’s less money to share with local governments. In response, local leaders lean heavily on property taxes to fund vital services. Williams added tax other reductions for business machinery and equipment put locals “between a rock and a hard place.”
“Further hamstringing local governments by abolishing their main revenue stream is not the answer to property tax relief,” he argued. “The state needs to step up and do more.”
He suggested more school funding would make levies less common and a so-called “circuit breaker” limiting property tax based on income would reduce the burden on those who need it most. But paying for those ideas isn’t likely to gain traction in the General Assembly. The best source for funding? Williams said lawmakers should raise income taxes on higher earning Ohioans.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The focus on funding facilities for Arkansas prisoners shifts from the state to the counties this week as voters in Madison and Pope counties consider sales tax and bond proposals in special elections Tuesday. 
Madison County voters are considering adopting a 1% sales tax for operation and maintenance of a new county jail that’s scheduled to be complete in June. Meanwhile, Pope County voters are being asked to approve an $89.9 million bond issue to build a new county jail and 911 call center, and a 0.75% sales tax to pay off the bond debt.
During the 2025 legislative session that adjourned last week, lawmakers rejected a $750 million appropriation bill to fund construction of a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County that supporters, including the governor, have said is needed to alleviate crowding in county jails, several of which are holding state inmates due to a lack of prison space.
Arkansas lawmakers consider other funding methods as they abandon sixth prison appropriation vote

Because Madison County only has a 24-hour holding facility, County Judge Larry Garrett said they ship prisoners to other counties, some as far away as Lafayette County in southeast Arkansas. 
“We’re hauling prisoners outside the county to be housed in other county jails and that has become very difficult,” he said. “Every jail is overcrowded and nowhere to go with them.”
Garrett estimated 50-60 Madison County prisoners are housed around the state, which costs the county $45-$70 a day per person. The lack of a jail is also costing Madison County manpower, especially on long hauls to Lafayette County, which Garrett said takes two deputies off the street for 12 hours. 
An effort to build a jail has been ongoing for years, according to The Madison County Record. Ballot measures to support construction of a county jail failed in 2008, 2013 and 2014. In 2022, a construction tax passed, but a 1.25% maintenance and operation tax failed by about 200 votes. A 1% maintenance tax failed by 40 votes last November.
Because he knew they “can only do it once,” Garrett said they tried to build for the future and used $16 million to construct a 148-bed jail, though he doesn’t expect the facility to open at full capacity immediately. Garrett estimated it would cost $1.9 million to return prisoners currently housed around the state to Madison County, which he said they can’t afford right now.
If voters approve the maintenance and operation tax Tuesday, Garrett said it will help run the new jail, which he estimated will cost around $2.5 million to operate annually. That would include the cost of food and medical services and the salaries of employees, which Garrett said would be around 15 people at full staff. 
Local officials have hosted town halls and tours of the new jail, the latter of which Garrett said was “very positive,” though he said he’s not sure how that will translate at the ballot box. 
“I think everybody wants a jail because we don’t have one and they know that the criminals are getting turned loose,” he said. “They want a jail, they just don’t want to have to pay to run it.”
Garrett said he understands the aversion to more taxes, but noted that everyone who purchases something in the county like gas or fast food will pay the sales tax, not just local residents. Additionally, he said the City of Huntsville sunset a 1-cent sales tax last year, so the jail’s maintenance and operation tax would basically take the place of that.
 Pope County

In Pope County, officials have also hosted town halls to inform local voters about the proposed three-quarter-cent sales tax to construct, operate and maintain a new jail and 911 call center. New facilities are needed because the county’s population has doubled since construction of the current jail in 1981, Pope County Judge Ben Cross said. 
County officials started the year with 11,000 active misdemeanor warrants, but because of overcrowding, the current 172-bed jail is only being used to hold felons and people who’ve committed violent misdemeanors like domestic violence, Cross said. 
If officials receive approval from voters Tuesday, Cross said the county owns 26 acres north of Exit 83 along I-40 where the new facility can be built. Because “you get more bang for your buck,” officials would construct one building that would house a 400-bed jail and 911 center, as well as the county’s sheriff’s office and office of emergency management, he said. 
The acreage would provide space to expand in the future, and the tax, which wouldn’t sunset, would provide a revenue source to continue operating the facility, Cross said. 
“You can’t put a price on public safety, and that’s one reason this is not a sunset tax because you have to have that money for generations to come to operate a facility like this,” he said. “If you sunsetted it and you built this facility, then you don’t have money to maintain and operate it. Somewhere in the future you’re kicking that can down the road.”

(Courtesy of the Lakes Region Conservation Corps)A program serving New Hampshire lakes since 2017 was a casualty of the Trump administration’s massive cuts to AmeriCorps, a federal agency that engages service members around the country. 
On April 26, members of the Lakes Region Conservation Corps learned their program had been terminated effective immediately. For years, corps members coming to New Hampshire from around the country have done crucial conservation work related to water quality, maintaining public access to trails, running educational programs, and much more. 
The cuts have left the eight host sites to come up with new plans quickly, just on the brink of the busy summer season. 
“It’s causing this strain on our organizations that have come to rely on this work that’s helped really exponentially grow the work that we do,” said Rebecca Hanson, executive director of the Newfound Lake Region Association, which had been one of the program sites. “And even just the pivot is taking a huge amount of energy, and it’s a momentum interrupter and interrupting, you know, the actual conservation work that we’re trying to do.”
Twenty-eight positions with the lakes program were affected, 16 of which were active members, with $567,000 in federal funding lost, said Rachel Bruns, chief engagement officer for America’s Service Commissions, a nonprofit representing state service commissions and other groups that receive AmeriCorps funding. 
They’re among the over 30,000 AmeriCorps members around the country affected by the sudden terminations, who had their lives overturned “really in a matter of minutes,” Bruns said. America’s Service Commissions has launched an emergency fund to support service members struggling with the loss of living stipends, health care, and housing.
“There’s still really no official communication that has come to us or the field at large regarding the reason for these grant terminations,” Bruns said. “So the only kind of information that has been provided is what was stated in the termination letters, which stated that the grant no longer effectuates agency priorities.”
The terminations “don’t seem to follow any obvious logic, and really there doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason for which grants were terminated and which grants were not terminated,” Bruns said.
The termination letters came from an AmeriCorps email address, she said. “It’s our understanding that the termination notices are, we believe, really directed by the Department of Government Efficiency, but the notifications don’t explicitly state that,” Bruns said. 
The Washington Post reported on April 25 that DOGE ordered AmeriCorps to end $400 million in grants, or about 41% of the agency’s grant funding. 
Bruns was aware of four grants in New Hampshire that had been terminated, including the lakes program; a clean energy planning grant, which she said didn’t have members associated with it; the RSVP program for service members 55 and older; and a placeholder grant that Volunteer NH could use to fund needs in the state in the upcoming program year.
“Across the country, we are gravely concerned about what this means for the community services that these AmeriCorps members were providing,” Bruns said.
The day the news reached the Squam Lakes Association, Hunter Hine, a service member from Maryland, was getting ready for a volunteer program to help the local salamander population when he ran into another member who said they were having an emergency meeting. There, he learned that the program he had committed to stay with for several more months no longer existed.
“It was very surreal,” Hine said.
For Hine, “getting this job was super important for my career goals, for getting to, really, the place I wanted to go, which was working in an environmental nonprofit, like a watershed organization.” 
Since January, his service has stretched across a broad spectrum of work. He has engaged volunteers, particularly with the water quality volunteering program, “where volunteers get trained on sampling and measuring equipment to test temperature and phosphorus and chlorophyll and indicators of health around the lake,” he said. He’s also done trail work and created social media graphics and flyers, and with summer coming, he and others will help with campsite hosting, kayak and canoe rentals, and more.
At the Squam Lakes Association, the organization funded about half the program, with the government funding the other half, said EB James, its executive director.
With their busy season having just begun, “we’re hitting this with as much optimism as we can,” James said. With the program dismantled, the eight host sites are no longer affiliated, and each is responding differently, with some keeping their people and some not, he said. At the Squam Lakes Association, they are working to maintain their commitment to those who joined them to serve for a full term that started in January and was set to end in the fall.
“We committed to them in January that we are going to give them a leadership conservation experience through November, and our board has just agreed that we are going to figure out how to get that done,” James said. “So on the private side, you know, we’re going to make sure that our commitment to this doesn’t go (away), you know, for this year anyway. … We’re not exactly sure how we’re going to do that, but we’re going to.”
With members coming from all over, “just being done” is “not really a tenable option,” James said. He described the loss of the program as “a radical change.”
“These young folks signed up to do service to the community and service to America, and it’s still needed,” James said. “Just because the program is gone doesn’t mean the need has disappeared. And so … we’re going to honor that commitment.”
At the Newfound Lake Region Association, three service members were scheduled to join the site on May 19 until the end of October, with AmeriCorps set to cover their living allowance and education awards, and the site providing the housing, Hanson said. 
Service members have carried out “a lot of our mission work, a lot of that on the ground conservation work” since the site joined the program in 2019, Hanson said. 
They have worked on stormwater projects, with “stormwater being the biggest impact to water quality in lakes throughout the state,” she said. They’ve done water quality monitoring, weed watching to protect the lakes from invasive species, run free educational programs for all ages, served as hosts at the Grey Rocks Conservation Area, helped with writing and program implementation, and “other odd jobs that are required for a small nonprofit,” Hanson said.
The association had to act quickly to figure out how that work could still get done and maintain the commitment to those who had agreed to serve at the site. The organization found money in its budget to pay the would-have-been service members an hourly wage as conservation assistants for a shortened season that will run through the end of August. 
AmeriCorps, with its funding support for service members, “really increased the amount we could do” and allowed it to use its budget and donated funds for other mission-related purposes, Hanson said.
James said that when floods struck the area a couple of years ago, “our AmeriCorps members were first responders.” They’ve been “absolutely fundamental to the successes this organization has had protecting the water quality,” he said. And “this program has been responsible for maintaining a ton of public access — like almost all public access — certainly in the Squam area and in many places throughout the center of New Hampshire,” he said. 
The lakes program has also been an important pipeline for future environmental leaders in the state, James said.
“If you look out at the seven years of folks that have come through here, just about every, certainly halfway large, conservation group in the center of the state has hired a past AmeriCorps member in some capacity,” James said.
For Hine and his peers, it’s an uncertain climate. Pointing to cuts across federal government positions, “it’s definitely a worrisome time for trying to be in this field and for your career in this field,” Hine said, “but at the same time, it seems like there is some hope.”
He said he and his peers — most of whom are not from New Hampshire — were committed to continuing to be of service.

States are increasingly setting policy for sheriffs on how much they can cooperate with ICE at local jails.  (Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Local sheriffs are on the front lines in deciding whether to participate in the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. But states increasingly are making the choice for them.
More and more, sheriffs’ hands are tied no matter whether they do — or don’t — want to help with deportations, though they often get the blame when conservatives draw up lists of sanctuary cities.
“‘Naughty lists,’ as we call them, are not super helpful here,” said Patrick Royal, a spokesperson for the National Sheriffs’ Association. “We all know there are places like Colorado where you can’t [help with deportations], and places like North Carolina where you have to.”
Cooperation between sheriffs and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lies at the heart of the Trump administration’s immigration detention policy. The administration plans to punish noncooperative jurisdictions with funding cuts — though many legal experts agree that cooperation is voluntary unless state or local laws say otherwise.
Trump orders list of ‘sanctuary cities’ to target for funding freeze

Sheriffs, who typically run local jails, must decide what to do when faced with immigration detainers — requests from ICE to hold onto incarcerated people up to two extra days so ICE officers can show up and arrest them. ICE issues those detainers when the agency reviews fingerprints sent electronically for background checks as part of the jail booking process.
Otherwise, arrested suspects who post bond or are otherwise released by a judge might go free despite their immigration status, prompting ICE in some cases to pursue them in the community.
In North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden ran on a platform of limiting cooperation with ICE  when he was elected in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, in 2018. But today, McFadden must comply with detainers because of a state law passed last year.
In a now-retracted Facebook post, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in late April accused Mecklenburg and several other North Carolina counties of “shielding criminal illegal immigrants” as sanctuary jurisdictions. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said in the post he was writing federal legislation to prosecute sanctuary jurisdictions.
“You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both,” McFadden said. He added that he’d like more choice about whether to comply with detainers. A federal funding cutoff would endanger important jail programs such as rape counseling, he said.
“Everybody’s focused on immigration like that’s the biggest fire, and nobody wants to address the other things. The losers will be the prisoners who need all these services we provide,” McFadden said.










You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both.


– Sheriff Garry McFadden, Mecklenburg County, N.C.


Conservative sheriffs in Democratic-controlled states also can be frustrated by state policy on detainers. Sheriff Lew Evangelidis of Worcester County, Massachusetts, said he’s been criticized for releasing prisoners wanted by ICE but sometimes has no choice: A 2017 state Supreme Court ruling prohibits holding prisoners based on detainers.
“If they [ICE] want this person and consider them a threat to public safety, then I want that person out of my community. I want to keep my community safe,” said Evangelidis. He supported a Republican-sponsored effort in the state legislature to allow 12-hour holds for ICE if a judge determines the prisoner is a threat to public safety, but the amendment was voted down in April.
States act on detainers
Many experts agree that ICE detainers can be legally ignored if states allow sheriffs to do that.
“That detainer request is just that, a request, it’s not a requirement,” said Cassandra Charles, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is opposing Louisiana’s lawsuit to reverse a court-ordered ban on cooperation between Orleans Parish and ICE.
The general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, Eddie Caldwell, agreed that the detainers are voluntary under federal law.
The association supports a state bill now under consideration that would require not only the 48-hour detention but also a notice sent 48 hours before release to let ICE know the clock is running. The proposal has passed the House.
The notification matters, Caldwell said, because there can be criminal proceedings that take weeks or months, so ICE in many cases doesn’t realize the 48-hour window has started.
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

Tillis’ office said the senator’s disagreement with McFadden, a Democrat, and other sheriffs is about that notification.
“It’s not necessarily that [sheriffs] are breaking the law, but rather making it as difficult as possible for ICE to take prisoners into custody by refusing to do some basic things. Notification is important,” said Daniel Keylin, a senior adviser to Tillis.
States including California, Colorado and Massachusetts ban compliance with the ICE detainers, on the general principle that it’s not enough reason to hold people in jails when they’re otherwise free to go because of bail or an end to their criminal cases. Those three states have made recent moves to defend or fine-tune their rules.
California’s attorney general also has issued guidance to local jurisdictions based on a 2017 state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities. That law withstood a court challenge under the first Trump administration.
Colorado has a law against holding prisoners more than six hours longer than required, and a new bill sent to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week would specify that even those six hours can’t be for the purpose of an immigration detainer.
Iowa, Tennessee and Texas are among the states requiring cooperation with detainers.
And Florida has gone further, requiring sheriffs to actively help ICE write detainers though official agreements in which local agencies sign up to help enforce immigration laws.
Cooperation boosts arrests
Such cooperation makes a big difference, experts say — jails are the easiest place to pick up immigrants for deportation, and when local sheriffs and police help out, there are more arrests.
“A larger share of ICE arrests and deportations are happening in places where local law enforcement is cooperative with ICE,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director for the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program, speaking at a recent webinar.
“A declining share of arrests and deportations are happening from places like California, where there are really strict limitations on local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE,” she added.
ICE is making about 600 immigration arrests daily, twice the rate as during the last year of the Biden administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking at the same event.
Reports on deportations are incomplete, Chishti said, but he estimated the current administration is on track to deport half a million people this year and is trying to get that number higher.
“The Trump administration has not been able to change the laws that are on the books, because only Congress can do that,” Chishti said. “It’s going to take congressional action for the Trump administration to achieve its aim of higher [arrest and deportation] numbers.”
Here’s the latest on how states are cooperating with Trump’s deportation plans

President Donald Trump has added more pressure, last month requesting a list from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of sanctuary cities, which he says would face funding cuts. The administration also has sued some states, including Colorado, Illinois and New York, over their policies.
Asked for comment on the legality of funding cutoffs for sanctuary policies, Bondi’s office referred to a February memo in which she promised to “end funding to state and local jurisdictions that unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.” The memo cites a federal law saying local officials “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” communication about immigration status.
Local jurisdictions in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington joined a February lawsuit led by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California against a Trump administration executive order calling for defunding cities with sanctuary policies, calling the order “illegal and authoritarian.”
In April, a U.S. district court in California issued a preliminary injunction in that case preventing any funding cutoff over sanctuary policies to the cities and counties in the lawsuit. And on Friday, the federal judge, William Orrick, ruled that the injunction applies to any list of sanctuary jurisdictions the administration may target for funding cuts.
Trump’s new executive order seeking the list cannot be used as “an end run” around Orrick’s injunction, the judge wrote, while he decides the legality of detainer policies and other issues.
“The litigation may not proceed with the coercive threat to end all federal funding hanging over the Cities and Counties’ heads like the sword of Damocles,” Orrick wrote.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-13 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Culture war comes to CT in debate on trans rights in nursing homes,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/13/ct-trans-rights-nursing-homes/,The bill signaled the CT House Speaker's willingness to defy Trump's order that ended federal recognition of transgender persons.,"In rising last week to make his first speech to the Connecticut House of Representatives, Rep. MJ Shannon, D-Milford, stepped onto one of America’s culture-war battlefields: a debate over transgender rights that President Donald J. Trump is intent on erasing.
Shannon, a 24-year-old gay man elected last fall, said he was making a gesture to aging gay-rights pioneers by volunteering to take on the task of explaining, defending and seeking passage of House Bill 6913, “An Act Concerning LGBTQ+ Discrimination in Long-Term Care Facilities.” 
“These folks, they fought the fight,” Shannon said.
Recommended by the state’s long-term care ombudsman, the bill would affirm and require public notice in nursing homes that state and federal law prohibits discrimination on any number of counts, among them sexual orientation, HIV status and “gender identity and expression.”
Essentially a restatement of existing laws, the bill also included one provision that offered a granular example of how they should be enforced: No facilities could “refuse to assign a room to a transgender resident other than in accordance with the transgender resident’s gender identity.”
To Rep. Joe Canino, R-Torrington, who is 27 and was elected in November in the same legislative class as Shannon, that sounded like someone’s grandma might get a trans roommate without their consent.
“This is terrifying. This is sick. It is absurd,” Canino said during the debate. “And it’s not the type of policy we should be making in this body.”

The bill came to a vote only after the adoption of a bipartisan amendment negotiated by Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, the co-chair of the Judiciary Committee. It  struck the provision stating a transgender patient’s right not to be refused a room or not to be forcibly transferred.
“Well, that’s a right every resident should have, whether you’re trans or not trans, right?” Stafstrom said in an interview Monday. Making the bill less specific broadened its reach, not limited it, he said.
Also stricken was language specifying that a trans person could dress as those chose.
The amended version passed on a vote of 124 to 19, with no Democrats and less than half the GOP minority opposed.
In calling the bill for a debate, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, signaled a willingness to engage in culture-war politics and a defiance of Trump’s executive order that repudiated “gender ideology” and “gender identity” and ended any federal recognition or accommodation of transgender persons.
“We don’t run from contact on these issues,” Ritter said. 
Ritter noted the passage the previous week of a reproductive health bill that allows minors access to contraception without parental consent or notification.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said the two bills, plus a gun control measure that exposes gun manufacturers and dealer to liability claims, are evidence of a Democratic majority interested in highlighting national politics.
“I think the Democrats are overplaying their hand this year,” said Candelora, who voted for the amended nursing home bill. “If you see the priorities coming out, it is about guns, reproductive health and LGBT issues, and that’s the wedge issues that they win on.”
The LGBTQ+ nursing home bill originated from the legislature’s Aging Committee, not typically an incubator of controversy.
Mairead Painter, the long-term care ombudsman, told the committee her office has cases “related to discrimination, harassment, and isolation faced by LGBTQ+ residents within skilled nursing facilities.”
Complaints included the denial of admissions and the “intentional misgendering” of transgender patients, Painter said.
Amy Porter, the commissioner of aging and disability services, also had recommended passage. 
“While the LGBTQ+ community has seen significant gains in civil rights over the past several decades, negative disparities unfortunately still exist at every stage of their lives. All people have the right to age with dignity in a safe living environment free from discrimination,” Porter testified.
A legal prohibition against gay sex was repealed in Connecticut in 1971. Twenty years later, the state outlawed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in housing and employment. In 2011, the state banned discrimination in public accommodations based on “gender identity or expression.”
That is precisely the phrase that Trump is working to erase. On his first day in office, the president signed an executive order stating, “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.”
Among other things, Trump ordered that that “gender” be struck from federal documents in favor of “sex” and reversed the Biden administration’s policy of allowing transgender individuals to mark an X for gender on their passports, rather than male or female.
“Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being,” Trump wrote. “The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system.”
Last week, in the debate of HB 6317, similar sentiments were expressed in challenges to Shannon by Canino and a half dozen other Republicans.
“Can you explain to me what gender identity is?” asked Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott.
“Gender identity is how somebody would identify themselves and their preferred identity that they choose,” Shannon replied.
“So it’s how they identify themselves. But I’m confused as to what that means. Identify as what?” she asked.
Shannon referred her to Connecticut law, which states gender identity can be defined as other than the sex assigned at birth based on medical and other evidence and the assertion that “gender related identity is a sincerely held part of the person’s core identity” and “not being asserted for an improper purpose.”
Mastrofrancesco asked Shannon for his definition of gender.
“When you are born, you either have a penis, that would consider you to be a boy, and if you are born with a vagina, you are a girl,” she said. “Are you telling me that there’s something different other than a vagina or a penis, whether you are a boy or girl?”
“That is simplifying it a lot, but yes, that is how they determine [gender] at birth,” Shannon said.
What about gender expression, she asked.
“When we talk about expression, are we talking about a facial expression?” she said. “Or is it maybe the way they act, maybe the way they dress?”
For a second time, Shannon referred her to the gender identity and expression law that has been on the books in Connecticut for 14 years. 
Canino asked Shannon, “Is woman a gender expression?”
“Yes, woman can be a gender expression,” Shannon replied.
“What is a woman?” Canino asked.
Shannon hedged, saying he lacked the background to provide a precise definition.
“I do not believe that you need any type of degree, any real type of education, to understand what a man and a woman is,” Canino said. “I think every single rational person in this room can tell you exactly what a man and a woman is, and that really just underlies the absurdity of what we are doing here today.”
In an interview Monday, Canino said he views being transgender as a “delusion,” not a status.
“The issue more broadly is it’s delusional at best to say women can become men and men can become women,” Canino said. “I would argue that the vast majority of residents in Connecticut would have a problem with that.”
If he had his preference, the 2011 law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression would be repealed. It passed then on a party-line vote, with every Republican opposed.
Shannon and Canino are both former legislative staffers and members of Generation Z who captured seats last fall that had long been held by the opposite party. Each said they were comfortable bringing a national debate on transgender rights into the Connecticut House.
Neither was born when the state’s original gay rights law was passed in 1991, and both were children when same-sex marriage was legalized here in 2005.
Shannon said the defense of gay rights now falls on Gen Z.
“There are, of course, people older that do care about it, but right now, the driving force is younger folks,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7450-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-13 05:01:48.900233

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)The Republican majority on the Ohio Supreme Court ruled last week that nitrogen gas didn’t qualify as toxic in 2016 when it killed a worker at TimkenSteel — a company founded by an important Republican family.
The family sold majority ownership of the company in 2014, but appeared to still be invested and playing a leadership role when the accident took place. Members of the family have continued to be big contributors to Republicans — including three of the justices who ruled against the killed worker’s widow.
At issue in the case was whether nitrogen could be considered toxic at any concentration. At stake was tens of thousands of dollars a year that the company could have been on the hook to pay for decades. 
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost is currently pushing to use nitrogen gas in the state’s death chamber. 
In March of 2016, Kenny Ray Jr., 32, was inspecting fire extinguishers at TimkenSteel’s Faircrest plant. When he went into a pressurized elevator-control room, a pulse-cleaning system malfunctioned, the room filled with nitrogen and Ray, who also worked as a firefighter and policeman, suffocated.
His widow, Sharmel Culver, was awarded death benefits, which are two-thirds of the deceased worker’s average weekly pay, but capped at about $800 a week. Culver wanted more, arguing that her husband was killed by safety violations at the plant.
Days after Ray’s death, the Canton Repository reported that TimkenSteel had a history of safety violations. The company was facing $500,000 in fines at the time of the accident, and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration had placed the company on its list of severe violators, the paper reported.
Culver, Ray’s widow, wanted TimkenSteel to pay her a “violation of a specific safety requirement” benefit. That could have forced the company to pay half again as much as she was getting in death benefits. 
And TimkenSteel might have had to pay for a long time. Spouses are eligible for the benefit as long as they live or until the remarry. Dependent children are eligible until they turn 21 — 25 if they’re in school full time.

Culver said she was entitled to the extra benefits because TimkenSteel violated rules requiring the company to minimize an employee’s exposure to air contaminants and to provide respiratory equipment to protect against them.
The Ohio Industrial Commission denied the claim, saying that in order to be a contaminant, nitrogen had to be toxic in any amount. 
Nitrogen is a common element which makes up about 3% of the human body. It also makes up about 78% of the air we commonly breathe. 
But nitrogen dispels oxygen, and when oxygen concentrations drop below 16% the brain orders the lungs to breathe faster and deeper. When they drop to around 5%, coma and death happen quickly, the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board reported.
Highly concentrated nitrogen is such an effective killer that Alabama is using it in its death chamber.
When Culver, Ray’s widow, appealed the Industrial Commission’s denial of her claim to the 10th District Court of Appeals, that court agreed with her. In directing the Industrial Commission to reconsider its denial, last year it said that whether a substance can be considered toxic must take into account how concentrated it is and how that concentration affects human health.
“In order for this definition to make sense, it must be understood to mean a substance becomes toxic when it is present in the atmosphere at an abnormal level,” the judges wrote. “This is not a static amount, but a threshold relative to the unique properties of each substance.”
However, the Ohio Supreme Court last week rejected that reasoning.
“Culver’s position is essentially that Ray died because of a hazardous concentration of nitrogen gas in the atmosphere; ergo, nitrogen gas is an ‘air contaminant,'” the six Republican justices wrote. “But the definition of ‘air contaminant’ in effect at the time of Ray’s death included only ‘toxic’ gases…”
The lone Democratic Justice, Jennifer Brunner, wrote a dissent accusing her colleagues of playing word games to deny killed workers’ families due compensation.
Such games are “a poor excuse for denying justice to workers whose injuries result in death,” Brunner wrote. “We can and should recognize that the term ‘hazardous concentration’ and the plain meaning of ‘toxic gases’ provide relief for fatally injured workers such as Ray. These regulatory terms are not and should not be used to perform ‘gotcha’ jurisprudence based on rules of construction about redundancy.”
The presence of the Timken name in the case also raises questions, but they’re hard to answer. The family founded a company that in 1901 moved to Canton, started manufacturing roller bearings and then moved into steel, power transmission, and other areas.
It’s also closely associated with Republican politics in Ohio. Jane Timken — wife of former chairman, CEO and board president Ward Timken Jr. — was chair of the Ohio Republican Party from 2017 to 2021. Last year she was elected to the Ohio Senate after running as a Republican.
The Timken family has also generously donated to Republican causes and candidates — including for the Ohio Supreme Court. Records at the Ohio Secretary of State’s office indicate that Ward Timken Jr. contributed $80,000 to national and state Republican groups just in the five weeks before the 2020 election.
The Timken Good Government Fund in 2022 gave $2,000 each to the committees of Republican justices Pat DeWine and Pat Fischer. The same year, Jane Timken gave the justices $2,500 each, and last year she contributed $2,000 to a committee for another Republican Justice, Megan E. Shanahan, state records show.
A spokesman for the Supreme Court was asked if the judges believed they had a conflict of interest.
“Requests for recusal are governed by Supreme Court Practice Rule 4.04,” the spokesman, Andy Ellinger, said in an email. “No party in this case filed a request under that rule requesting any justice to recuse. Moreover, each justice may recuse themselves if they deem they have a conflict.”
It’s also hard to learn the extent of the family’s involvement in TimkenSteel when Ray was killed at its Faircrest plant in March 2016.
A spokesman for the Timken Company noted that TimkenSteel was spun off in 2014 and now has a new name, Metallus. He referred questions to that company.
“On behalf of Metallus (formerly TimkenSteel), I’d like to clarify that the Timken family has had no management role, board seats or other ties to the company since 2019,” Director of Communications Jennifer Beeman said in an email. “Additionally, they are not considered major shareholders. We will not be providing any additional comments.”
Asked in a follow-up question what the Timken family’s involvement was in 2016 — when Ray was killed, in other words — Beeman didn’t respond.

Trumbull Correctional Institution staff received Taser 10s last week and Ross Correctional Institution will start staff training this month, said JoEllen Smith, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. 
The pilot program costs $349,441 a year, which includes training and certifications, Smith said. Staff must complete training to carry the tasers.

“Over 78% of those currently housed in the department have committed a crime of violence in their lifetime,” Smith said in an email. “This means that the inmates the staff supervise are more dangerous than they have been in the past, and we want our staff to have the tools to do their jobs safely.”
On Christmas Day, an inmate beat Officer Andrew Lansing to death at Ross Correctional. This was the first time an employee was killed by a prisoner since 1996. 
“The TASER 10 devices have built-in Bluetooth signaling that is connected to our body-worn cameras,” Smith said in an email. “The body-worn cameras will begin recording if a TASER 10 device is taken off safe mode. The TASER 10 will not fire when it is in safe mode.” 
Staff in Ohio prisons do not carry firearms. 
Tasers are not to be used for punishment and they are not to be used if the incarcerated person is pregnant or six weeks postpartum, in an elevated physical location, submerged in water, younger than 15 years old, restrained, or riding bicycles or in control of moving vehicles, according to the ODRC taser policy, dated May 6.
The exceptions are “when necessary to protect self or others from an immediate threat of death or serious physical harm threatened by an incarcerated person or anyone else; to prevent or halt the commission of an escape or to apprehend an escapee; or to prevent loss of control of the institution, or a significant part of, or to regain such control,” according to the ODRC policy. 
The Ohio Justice & Policy Center is asking ODRC to pause the pilot program.  
“Threatening the use of a taser is like threatening to shoot someone,” said Ohio Justice & Policy Center Policy Director Michaela Hahn Burriss. “Just because a taser might make somebody more compliant doesn’t necessarily mean that you de-escalate the situation. Using a taser is force. Tasers are lethal.”
A 2017 Reuters report found 104 prison deaths from 2000-2017 were linked to tasers. The report also detailed hundreds of examples of tasers being misused in U.S. prisons.  
“Tasers pose a risk, not only to the incarcerated population, but to employees as well,” Burriss said. “This is something that is well documented.”
At least 95% of incarcerated people will eventually be released, according to the Education Commission of the States. 
“Tasers are not going to rehabilitate someone,” Burriss said. “We don’t have a lot of confidence, given what we are experiencing and seeing that this is going to be handled and rolled out in a way that keeps people safe. … These are life and death stakes.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)After gaining the Ohio Republican Party’s endorsement for governor, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has an additional leg up on any primary competitors — getting access to key resources and support.
It’s a year until Republican voters need to choose a nominee for Ohio governor, and the GOP voted Friday to endorse Ramaswamy.
“We want to use that to not just unite the Republicans of Ohio, but to unite the Ohioans across the state,” Ramaswamy told reporters after getting the vote.
With the endorsement comes all the perks along with it.
“There are a couple of logistical elements that relate to the state party that allow us to work together with a one team mentality,” he continued.
Republican strategist Terry Casey explained this sets him up for success versus any other GOP candidate. Ramaswamy will get more resources, like money, mailers, mail indicia and voter lists, from the party. Plus, he will be listed as the candidate to support on the sample ballot.
“The less time and money you waste on a divisive primary, the more you focus on the general election, the better off you are,” Casey said.
The entrepreneur announced his bid for Ohio governor back in February. Soon after, he also received the coveted endorsement from President Donald Trump.
Ramaswamy beat out Attorney General Dave Yost, whose team told us he is taking a few days to figure out his next plans.
“Part of [the endorsement] is narrowing the field and less wasting of money,” the strategist said. “So, that’s another nice way of saying, ‘narrow the field up.'”
Since the primary is so far away, Casey doesn’t rule out another candidate jumping in.
Some strategists have been pushing Lt. Gov. and former OSU football coach Jim Tressel to run, but he hasn’t officially announced. He is considering a run, according to a statement sent to News 5 last week.
“Clearly Jim Tressel has some name ID,” Casey said. “In theory, anybody has a chance. But the biggest question is, ‘What’s his message? Is he just going to be a continuation of Mike DeWine? What does he want to do new and different?'”
State Auditor Keith Faber said the party could have waited. In the 2022 gubernatorial election, the party didn’t endorse incumbent Gov. Mike DeWine until three months before the primary.
“I just didn’t think it was time for me to jump in and endorse personally at this point,” Faber said.
But Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, who is also being floated as Ramaswamy’s lieutenant governor, said he doesn’t think anyone new entering the race will change the party’s support.
“Lt. Gov. Tressel is doing an excellent job as lieutenant governor — let me start by saying that,” he said. “But when you look at the polling that’s come out, he’s been included in some of the polling, and I think what you’re seeing, though, is a uniting force right now behind Vivek Ramaswamy.”
During the gaggle, Ramaswamy didn’t answer a reporter’s question about Tressel possibly joining the race.
Still, there’s a long way until next May.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)In February, I testified against House Bill 2299, a bill to put the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism into statute, focused on university campuses and punishable by prosecution by the state’s attorney general, Kris Kobach. A watered-down version (Senate Bill 44), which took out most of the enforcement provisions, passed at the end of the session.
Both versions were aimed squarely at the University of Kansas, which had a pro-Palestinian encampment last year and which according to some has become a hotbed of antisemitism. The new law focuses on protest (no masks used “to harass Jewish students”) and curriculum (banning “incorporating or allowing funding of antisemitic curriculum or activities in any domestic or study abroad programs or classes”). Leaving aside the fact that it is impossible to study Western history and not encounter antisemitism, this language is extremely broad and could and probably would be used to suppress pro-Palestinian speech by students, visiting speakers, or in Muslim or Arab studies classes.
This points to the main problem with the IHRA definition of antisemitism: it equates anti-Zionism — opposition to Israel’s actions or even Israel itself — with antisemitism, a racialized hatred of Jewish people. This is a popular position among traditional Jewish communal organizations. Kansas City’s JCRB/AJC testified in favor of the original bill, which I remind you would have allowed Kobach to identify and prosecute “antisemitism.”
Anti-Zionism and antisemitism can and do overlap — people could hide their antisemitism behind expressions of anti-Zionism, for instance, or they can accuse random Jews of being responsible for Israel’s actions — but they are not the same. The many young Jews who took part in campus protests last year can attest to that.
(For the rest of this column I will refer to politicized accusations of antisemitism as “antisemitism.” Actual antisemitism — hatred of Jews — will remain without quotation marks.)
The bill raised two questions. First, why didn’t it address the explosion of antisemitism from the political right, from the poisonous discourse on the former Twitter to neo-Nazis at the Jan. 6, 2021, riot (now pardoned, of course) to white supremacists in close proximity, or even in the Trump administration (including, of course, Donald Trump himself).
Second, why is antisemitism on college campuses so unique and terrible that it requires special legislation addressing it, when allowing anti-Black racism on college campuses is practically a MAGA platform plank? This question was raised on the floor of the House, but it wasn’t answered.
Criminalizing speech critical of Israel in this way has become a significant problem. Campus protests were suppressed last year. Since the start of the second Trump term, people who have criticized Israel’s actions in Gaza — without necessarily attacking Israel’s “right to exist” — have been arrested and set for deportation for political speech, a clear violation of the First Amendment. Two of the most prominent examples are Columbia University’s Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of pro-Palestine protests there, and Tufts University’s Rumeysa Ozturk, who appears to have only co-written an op-ed in a student newspaper.
Both columns and protests are political speech protected by the First Amendment. Yes, even for noncitizens. There is no evidence that either of these people have been involved in any actual Jew-hatred, and as I will explain in a moment, protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza is justifiable.
Accusations of rampant “antisemitism” in universities is also the cudgel Trump is using to attack their funding and governance.
This crackdown is largely a project of the Christian right, as spelled out in the Heritage Foundation’s Project Esther, which focuses exclusively on antisemitism on the left and advocates for increased censorship and suppression of protest. “Antisemitism” has become today’s equivalent of McCarthy-era “communism” — the accusation itself is condemnatory. No further evidence (or thought) is needed.
That traditional Jewish communal organizations — particularly the Anti-Defamation League and JCRB/AJC — have allied themselves with this effort in the name of protecting Israel should be an embarrassment. This politicization of “antisemitism” doesn’t do Jews any favors. Not only have we consistently voted, by large majorities, for Democrats, but our very place in this society is built on the foundation of liberal democracy, especially freedom of expression and religion.
Jews have prioritized Bill of Rights protections for more than 100 years, including helping found the ACLU. It is a cruel irony indeed that these pillars of Jewish freedom in American society are being dismantled in the name of protecting Jews.
To which I say, no thanks.
Fortunately it appears that (some) people are catching on to the ruse: Several of the main liberal Jewish denominational bodies recently issued a joint statement “rejecting the false choice between confronting antisemitism and upholding democracy.” It’s a good statement, and it doesn’t assume the legitimacy of the “universities are hotbeds of antisemitism” framing. Other, similar statements have been released.
But as the “Antisemitism Awareness Act” working its way through the U.S. Congress makes clear, this problem will get worse before it gets better. In a moment that pulled back the curtain, a clause was added to that bill that would protect the “right” to say that “the Jews” killed Jesus — a calumny that has caused untold injury and death to Jews throughout history and is the very definition of actual antisemitic speech. (Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall, R-MAGA, sounded sympathetic last year.)
To be clear: People are criticizing Israel because it is committing significant human rights violations against Palestinians in the West Bank and especially Gaza, and not out of Jew-hatred. Jews are involved in every level of the Palestinian solidarity movement, including encampments. There are already laws to protect people from harassment and violence; Jews don’t require special protection. Claiming otherwise has real consequences for real people, including dividing Jews between “good Jews” who support Israel’s actions (and Trump) and “bad Jews” who don’t and should be suppressed.
Where antisemitism exists on the left and in the pro-Palestine movement, it should be criticized and condemned, but we shouldn’t deploy state power to slay dragons that aren’t really there. Policing Trumped-up, politicized charges of “antisemitism” is something that Christian nationalists, including Kobach and the Heritage Foundation, should not be empowered to do.

His House budget certainly follows up with that promise.
According to analysis by the Ohio River Valley Institute, the FY2027 school allocation under the House Plan falls $2.7 billion short of what the General Assembly agreed to invest in public education in the 2022 Fair School Funding Plan. That represents a funding cut of about 25% from the previous plan.
These cuts will be felt across the state. According to the same analysis, 91% of school districts will have less funding under the House plan than the Fair School Funding Plan. An unlucky 26 school districts will see their state support reduced by 50% or more.
In February, my firm Scioto Analysis asked 17 Ohio economists for their thoughts about the plan to cut spending on public education. Of those economists, 14 agreed the cuts would hurt Ohio’s economy in the long run. Only one disagreed.
Dr. Kathryn Wilson of Kent State University explained the harms reductions in school spending can have on the economy, saying they can lead to lower human capital development that hurts the productivity of future workers, but also that it can lead to more costs for taxpayers with more government assistance and criminal justice spending needed with a less educated state population.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In 2023, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis of school spending in Ohio. We built off evidence of the relationship between school spending, test scores, and graduation rates to estimate the long-term impacts of school spending on labor force productivity. We found that increased investment in students leads to wage impacts in the long run that will grow the state’s economy. We also found cuts will hurt productivity and reduce output for the state.
According to the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce, Ohio has about 1.7 million children currently enrolled from Kindergarten to Grade 12. This means the proposed $2.7 billion cut would represent about a $1,600 per-student decrease in spending from the baseline of the General Assembly’s Fair School Funding Plan.
In our 2023 study, we estimated what would happen if the state reduced school funding levels to the per-student expenditure in Indiana, which is about $3,600 lower than Ohio. We estimated this would cost the state somewhere between $30 billion and $120 billion in economic value in the long run.
Scaling these losses to match the Ohio House’s $1,600 reduction in per-pupil spending, we can estimate the reduction in statewide school funding will cost the state economy somewhere from $14 billion to $54 billion in the long run in the form of lower earnings from lower test scores, lower graduation rates, and higher social spending.
Yes, $2.7 billion is a lot of money. But educating a state workforce costs money. Cutting corners on education might lead to short-term benefits, but there are long-term costs the state will have to bear for decisions like this. These include lower productivity, lower earnings, and higher spending on social services and criminal justice.

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
The most likely Medicaid cuts would hit rural areas the hardest

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”










As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services


But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

But two people not in the room loomed large.","Given California’s daunting — even existential — array of social, economic and fiscal crises, it’s remarkable that anyone would volunteer to become its governor.
However, Gavin Newsom will vacate the office 19 months hence, with most of those crises still in place, and at least seven Democratic politicians yearn to succeed him.
Former state Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former Rep. Katie Porter, Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former State Controller Betty Yee put themselves on display Monday evening during a legislative conference of the state’s major union organizations.
It was what politicians call a “beauty contest,” in which candidates are given opportunities to briefly strut their stuff without any deep oratory. It was also an opportunity for the union leaders to pin them down on their top bread-and-butter issues, such as granting unemployment insurance benefits to striking workers, mandatory use of union labor in construction projects and more money for those projects, including the financially troubled bullet train.
With Lorena Gonzalez, head of the California Labor Federation, and Chris Hannan, president of the building trades, shooting the questions, the candidates were asked to wave flags indicating whether they supported the various union objectives.
Most toed the union line, although Villaraigosa, who sparred with education unions during his mayoralty, demurred on the unemployment insurance issue, citing its cost and the state’s chronic budget deficits.
That and some other issues were indirect potshots at Newsom, who has occasionally bucked the unions. He rejected striker unemployment benefits and his crusade to wean California from oil, which is beginning to shut down its refineries, drew opposition from the candidates when queried by refinery union members. Several said the campaign against oil would raise Californians’ already high costs of living and, as Yee put it, “cannot be on the backs of workers.”
As the “salon” continued, it was obvious that two people not in the ballroom of Sacramento’s downtown Sheraton Hotel were looming over the event: President Donald Trump and the woman he defeated last fall, former Vice President (and California senator) Kamala Harris.
Surprisingly, only Kounalakis brought up Trump without being prompted, since opposing Trump is a sacred tenet of California’s Democratic politicians. She vowed unrelenting resistance and others later followed her lead. However, Villaraigosa continued to somewhat set himself apart, saying “we can’t just take on Trump” but must address California’s many problems.

Harris was an even more powerful specter as she plays it coy on whether to rekindle her political career by running for governor. She apparently is weighing whether to do that or resume her quest for the White House in 2028, when Trump presumably will end his second term and depart.
A presidential rerun could put her in direct conflict with Newsom, who continues to emit indications of considering a White House campaign himself, while publicly denying such ambitions.
Were Harris to seek the governorship, polls indicate that she would be the immediate frontrunner, particularly in a crowded field of primary election hopefuls. However, it’s also likely that some of the seven current political samurai would drop out should Harris run. With a smaller field, one of the remaining Democrats might make the November runoff in the top-two primary, setting up a two-person duel.
Until Harris decides, however, everything is tentative and unsettled, including efforts to raise the many millions of dollars needed to campaign for statewide office in California. The union leaders who staged Monday’s event will also be major sources of campaign money for whomever they finally endorse.

In social media posts announcing his run Monday, King emphasized his military and law enforcement background. King served in the U.S. Army National Guard for four decades, retiring as a major general in 2023. He also served in the Atlanta Police Department and the Doraville Police Department, where he was chief for 17 years.
“I’ve had the privilege to lead your sons and daughters in some incredible places around the world: Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Africa. During President Trump’s first term, I served on the U.S. Mexico border. As an Atlanta police officer, I was shot and stabbed in the line of duty, protecting our community. I’ve never shied away from a fight, but what truly scares me today is having Jon Ossoff for six more years.”
King was appointed insurance commissioner by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 and elected to a full term in 2022, making him Georgia’s first Hispanic statewide elected official. He was born in Mexico and came to the U.S. at 17. He posted his announcement video to X in both English and Spanish, a sign he could be trying to court Latino voters.
Though Latino voters in Georgia favored former Vice President Kamala Harris over President Donald Trump in the 2024 election, Republicans have made inroads in recent years, and advocates report a lack of outreach to Latino Georgians from either major party.
In his announcement, King positioned himself as a strong potential ally to the president.
“President Trump got sent to Washington DC to solve some very big problems,” King said. “He needs help, and I’m asking for your support to go help President Trump and solve these incredibly big problems.”
King now joins Congressman Buddy Carter, a six-term Republican representing a coastal Georgia district, in the race against Ossoff. Carter threw his hat into the ring last week, also pitching himself as a strong Trump backer.

Ossoff is the only Democratic senator up for re-election in a state won by Trump in 2024, so the race for his seat is likely to keep attracting attention. Last week, Kemp announced that he doesn’t plan to run, which could spur even more Republicans to try their chances. He has raised more than $11 million so far in 2025, according to federal election filings.
Some of Carter’s colleagues in Congress are seen as potential contenders, including Reps. Rick Allen, Mike Collins and Rich McCormick as well as state Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper.
Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene took herself off the list last week with a social media post.
In a statement, Democratic Party of Georgia Chairman Charlie Bailey expressed confidence that Trump’s policies will harm any Republican’s chances in a general election.
“John King touting his loyalty to Donald Trump at the launch of his bid for Georgia’s Senate seat is telling yet not surprising as the Republican field grows and caters to the MAGA far-right,” Bailey said.

(Photo by Evan Visconti for the Virginia Mercury)Fishery managers from Maine to North Carolina, and members of the public, met last week to decide next steps to protect the Atlantic striped bass, a valued fish facing consecutive years of low spawning success and overfishing.
Atlantic striped bass, or rockfish, have been referred to as “everyman’s fish” because they are caught by such a wide population of anglers up and down the coast, said Alex McCrickard, the aquatic education coordinator for the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources.
Anglers can utilize a wide range of gear types and techniques to catch striped bass. Some target the fish for the excitement of catch and release, while others seek them out to harvest as a culinary staple.
As a resource, striped bass are one of the “most valuable recreati0nal fisheries on the Atlantic Coast,” said Emilie Franke, a fishery management plan coordinator for the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which manages interstate fishery regulations. “I think one of the really unique things about it is that the fisheries really vary from state to state.”
“The Chesapeake Bay is as important to the striped bass and its successful life history” as the fish are to the coastal communities and economies of the region, said Allison Colden, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s executive director for Maryland.
Striped bass rely on the tributaries and tidal estuaries of the Chesapeake Bay as a “foundational nursery ground” for the first few years of their lives, said Tom Dunlap, the riverkeeper for the James River Association. “As a top predator in the Bay ecosystem, (striped bass) are important for their relationships with all of our other species as well.”
An estimated 70% to 90% of all of the striped bass that make it into that coastal migratory stock start their lives in the Chesapeake Bay and its estuaries.
An unpredictable future
Climate change is a major factor contributing to the decline of striped bass, and it is one that is much harder to control than the overfishing that was uncovered by researchers in 2019.

Striped bass prefer cool, wet winters and springs, and as those conditions become less common as a result of climate change, “the probability that we are going to hit the lotto with the right combination of environmental conditions is becoming lower and more rare,” said Colden.
Wet springs produce high discharge volumes throughout the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay, which expands the habitat available for striped bass to spawn in, said Martin Gary, director of the Division of Marine Resources at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.
At the same time, those rains flush nutrients into the rivers that are necessary for zooplankton to successfully bloom, a critical food source for striped bass after hatching, Gary said.
If zooplankton are not successful, or if the timing is off between their bloom and the striped bass spawning runs, fewer fish will survive to bolster the future spawning population. Gary said the concern is that if we continue seeing consecutive, poor young-of-year classes, what will the stock look like over the next decade?
“We’ve got a double-edged sword where we’re not getting very good recruitment because of environmental factors, and the spawning stock biomass is low, too,” said Pat Geer, chief of fisheries management for the Virginia Marine Resources Commission.
Virginia has seen two consecutive years of historically low numbers of juvenile striped bass surveys, while Maryland has witnessed six consecutive years of low numbers. The data is compiled in a yearly stock assessment to give managers a sense of the reproductive success and early survival rate of the fish.
Juvenile striped bass populations low in annual Bay watershed survey

Below-average juvenile stocks mean that “once the adults that are currently in the population start to either be harvested or die out, there are very few young fish growing up to replace them,” said Colden.
“It’s going to take a long time to rebuild a population like striped bass that doesn’t mature until 5 to 7 years of age,” said Geer. But building up the spawning stock is “something we can control overtime.”
Gary said in the past, striped bass proved to be resilient, and bounced back after a moratorium was placed on the fishery in the 1980s due to fears of fishing the species to extinction. Within 10 years, striped bass were declared recovered up and down the coast.
Although Gary said the adult striped bass stocks are in much better shape today now than they were in the 1980s, managers cannot depend on the recovery witnessed in the early 1990s now that a new set of challenges exists, “especially in the face of climate change and the impacts of rapidly warming waters and changing marine and estuarine ecosystems.”
Changes to fishery regulations
New regulations were put in place last year by the Atlantic Striped Bass Management Board, which oversees interstate striped bass management for ASMFC, to establish a consistent size and bag limit throughout the Chesapeake Bay portion of the fishery.
Fishing seasons, on the other hand, are not consistent throughout the Bay, with management divided between multiple jurisdictions including Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission.
Outside of shortening the fishing seasons, managers are “really running out of options,” Geer said. Virginia already has a “pretty conservative” recreational harvest season of only about 100 days, one of the shortest on the East Coast, he said.

Currently, “no-target” closures for striped bass don’t exist in Virginia, meaning it is legal all year for recreational anglers to target the fish for catch and release. Virginia fishery managers are not proposing to add any additional regulations outside of what could be agreed upon this year by ASMFC, Geer said.
Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources, meanwhile, proposed a new layout to the board Tuesday for its 2026 fishing seasons that includes a no-target closure for striped bass fishing during the entire month of August, to limit the recreational fishery’s impact while water temperatures are high.
But DNR also proposed eliminating the no-target closure that is currently in place in Maryland waters during part of the spring spawning period, thus opening the entire spring season to catch-and-release fishing.
Maryland fishery managers said in their presentation to the board that “the proposal is an effort to refocus our conservation effort on the protection of the resident population in the Chesapeake Bay and realign with our neighboring jurisdictions.”
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has “for a long time” advocated for seasonal, summer closures as a way to protect striped bass during the time of year when they are most vulnerable to catch-and-release mortality.
“There are other fish species in the Bay at that time that are available to fish on, and we know that striped bass are typically pretty stressed during that time of year,” Colden said.
Studies have shown that when water temperatures exceed 70 degrees in freshwater spawning grounds, the catch-and-release mortality for striped bass increases significantly, above the usual average of 9%, McCrickard said.
The board’s technical committee will begin reviewing Maryland’s proposal before meeting again in August to consider what regulatory options for 2026, if any, it wants to approve for public comment.

Members of the board and the public raised concerns at the meeting over the possible negative impacts that could result from lifting no-target protections currently in place in Maryland during the spring spawning period.
Public comments on the board’s options, which last year exceeded 4,000 submissions but ultimately didn’t spur any additional protections to the 2025 season, would take place between late August through September, according to Franke, before the board makes its final decision on the 2026 regulations in October.
The eyes and ears on the water
Fishery managers are hesitant to continue piling regulations on a fishing community that they say as a whole provides many inherent benefits to striped bass recovery efforts.
Anglers are the eyes and ears on the water, monitoring the species on a regular basis, explained Gary. The information they provide is vitally important to fishery managers.
“When people are fishing, they care about the resource, and they’re going to be the best ones to spread the word to make sure people understand why we need good regulations that secure a promising future for the species,” Gary said.
Striped bass as a species are currently declared overfished, however there is no active overfishing occurring anymore, as a result of numerous regulatory actions taken by fishery managers after 2019.
Outside of regulating the fishery, angler education is another key to recovering striped bass stocks since usually about 90% of striped bass removals come from the recreational fishery.
McCrickard works to teach anglers about the best catch-and-release practices to give striped bass the best chance of survival after being released. Anglers should always wet their hands before handling striped bass to protect the fish’s protective slime coating, he said.
Removing the fish from the water for an extended period is known to have negative impacts, so ideally a soft rubber net can be used to keep the fish in the water when preparing to remove the hook or take a photo, McCrickard said.

When releasing the fish, McCrickard advises facing them upright against the current and allowing them to swim out of your hands freely when they are ready.
“Lactic acid builds up in the muscles during the fight, and it’s essential for anglers to let the fish recover on their own terms when they are ready,” he said.
Swimming upstream
There are currently moratoriums effective in Virginia banning the catch and possession of river herring, American shad and Atlantic sturgeon, which are threatened, anadromous species similar to striped bass in that they spend their adult lives in saltwater but migrate to freshwater rivers and streams to spawn.
“The common theme here is that our native migratory fishes are all struggling; they’re all suffering; they’re all frankly imperiled,” Dunlap said.
Unfortunately there is not a single smoking gun that experts can blame for the declines. If there were, “we’d stand a lot better chance of having greater success for now by bolstering these species,” said Dunlap. “They’re definitely suffering a death by a thousand cuts here.”
Outside of climate change and overfishing, striped bass and migratory fishes in general are known to face losses as a result of unprotected water withdrawals.
“These industrial uses of the river could have the unfortunate capacity to suck in a tremendous amount of larval fish and fish eggs, removing them from that year class,” Dunlap said. “That can unfortunately be just a wrong place, right time issue on the river system.”
There is also increased sediment flowing into the Chesapeake Bay tributaries as a result of more violent and frequent precipitation events and an increase in impermeable land surfaces throughout the watershed.
“The sediment itself will have knock-on effects for the environment,”  Dunlap explained, by burying aquatic vegetation, reducing the sunlight available for photosynthesis and changing the habitat for species that depend on it.
There are also habitat access issues as a result of the construction of dams and road culverts that block fish passage, as well as the understudied threat of a large invasive blue catfish population that feeds on and competes with native fish.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa senators voted 27-22 late Monday to pass a bill to limit the ability of carbon sequestration pipelines to use eminent domain, sending it to the governor’s desk after a drawn-out debate.
The decision follows four years of Iowans and House lawmakers urging for eminent domain reform in response to the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.
House File 639 comprised a number of bills passed by the House aimed at eminent domain. Senators tried repeatedly to change the scope of the bill with various amendments, none of which were adopted. 
Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink, R- Fort Dodge, said amid debates on eminent domain and carbon capture pipelines, that senators were “missing the point” that the bill was poorly written and likely to create problems.
“The point is a crappy bill that we’re going to be voting on here in a little bit,” Kraayenbrink said.  
Four years coming 
Landowners opposed to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline have traveled to the Capitol countless times over the past four years, urging lawmakers to move on the issue. 
Many of those opposed to the pipeline own land in its path and fear its impact to their land, property values and safety. 
The pipeline would transport carbon dioxide, captured from ethanol facilities, across Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, the Dakotas and into underground storage in North Dakota. The Iowa Utilities Commission granted the project eminent domain rights in June, though the project cannot begin construction until it has permits in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. 
Proponents of the pipeline say it will allow Iowa to enter new, low-carbon ethanol markets, which would in turn help corn and soybean farmers. 
The company’s permit in South Dakota was recently denied, following the state’s passage of a law preventing hazardous liquid pipelines carrying carbon dioxide from using eminent domain in the state. Summit has said it plans to reapply. 
HF 639, as written, changed definitions of a common carrier, increased insurance requirements to cover any damages to property and reimburse landowners for increases in premiums due to the pipeline, set requirements for the IUC and expanded who can intervene in IUC proceedings.
A group of 12 senators signed a letter last week saying they would not vote on budget legislation until the eminent domain bill was debated. Their move stalled action on budget bills and contributed to pushing the session into overtime.  Lawmakers have not received part of their per diem expense payments since May 2. After the pipeline bill passed, senators approved the budgets for education and agriculture and natural resources, sending them to the House.
Senators planned to debate the issue on Friday, and drew a crowd of interested constituents to the Capitol, but the chambers leaders did not bring the bill to the floor. 
Bousselot’s amendment fails
Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, the bill’s floor manager, proposed an amendment that would rewrite the bill, similar to what he had proposed in committee, that would have allowed companies to pursue voluntary easements outside of the project corridor, in order to avoid using eminent domain. 
Bousselot called the original bill a “Trojan horse” bill written by “climate extremists” trying to kill the Summit pipeline project. 
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, who sponsored HF 639, said it’s “ridiculous” to suggest the bill is about environmental extremists. 
“This is not about environmental extremism at all, it’s about protecting landowners,” Holt said. “I think that the arrogance the Senate is showing, the disrespect to property owners is frankly unacceptable.” 
Bousselot’s amendment would have kept HF 639 provisions requiring Iowa Utilities Commission members’ attendance at permit hearings, a one-year deadline for permit decisions, and would have held project operators responsible for damage to the land during the lifetime of the project. 
Under the amendment, the eminent domain changes would have applied to all projects seeking government permission to force unwilling landowners to give up easements for a court-determined price, not just carbon sequestration projects.
Bousselot said the amendment “protects Iowans, protects landowners of all types, for all project types.”
His amendment would have stopped carbon sequestration pipelines from using eminent domain, unless the project had been granted a permit by the IUC before the enactment date, or had a sole purpose of connecting to another project that was already granted eminent domain. 
“It ends eminent domain on CO2 pipelines in a constitutional manner, on a go forward basis,” Bousselot said. 
Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, said it’s “not correct” to say the bill is all about killing the Summit project.
“We’re just saying you have to follow the law,” Taylor said. 
Taylor said the requirement to use eminent domain is public use. 
“It’s not a positive business climate, it’s not helping the agribusinesses in the state, it’s not the price of corn or helping the ethanol plants, it’s public use,” Taylor said. 
Bousselot’s amendment failed narrowly, 28-22. 
Democrats push for simplified, eminent domain only amendment
Democrats submitted an amendment, with language from House File 943, which the House passed in March, to ban the use of eminent domain on pipelines transporting liquified carbon dioxide. 
Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, sponsored the amendment and said it would get at the “fundamental question” of eminent domain, which constituents have asked the body to debate.
Wahls said bipartisan conversations over the past several weeks have been “fractured” and “raucous.” 
“I think most of the people in this room are quite tired, but I’m quite positive that there is nobody in this room more tired than the landowners who are sitting in the gallery because they’ve been taking time out of their lives, not being paid to come to this building, and ask for their voice to be heard,” Wahls said. 
Bousselot argued that the amendment was not germane, since it was a “major change to the scope of the bill” and Senate President Amy Sinclair, R-Allerton, agreed and the amendment was scrapped.
On the ‘crappy’ bill
Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, asked Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, about some of the issues he had with the bill, including multiple definitions of a common carrier and an “elevated standard” for judicial review that he said would “bog the system down.” 
Klimesh also noted a lack of specificity in some of the language of the bill, like the section expanding intervenors in utility board cases that does not specify that members of the general assembly, city or county officials must be in Iowa. 
“I mean is that the intention really, to bog this system down with interveners from any place or anywhere, any elected official, any city council, county official, or any resident with plausible interest in the proceedings?” Klimesh said. 
Following the decision, Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, said the arguments brought up on the Senate floor about the bill providing for out-of-state individuals to intervene with the Iowa permitting process were incorrect, and “it reflects a misunderstanding of the IUC system and administrative law.”
He said the process of intervention only gives individuals the right to file motions and get copies of meetings by email.
“It’s not an invitation to sue,” Thomson said. “And there is a limitation on there, that you have to have some connection with what’s going on. It’s absurd to say that we’re opening the process up to endless litigation.”
Klimesh asked on the floor how the insurance clauses of the bill would be determined. 
He said the bill, as written, would make it more difficult for all pipeline projects in the future and tie up “critical infrastructure projects” in court and therefore pass costs onto consumers who would have increased utility costs. 
Klimesh said in the future, companies that want to build pipelines in the state would be deterred by the requirements in the bill that would be costly. 
Alons said much of the language was a “codification” of what is already in the IUC rules. 
Klimesh said the bill would lead to increasing costs on energy for Iowans. 
“Cost drivers, cost increases — they’re based off decisions we make here in this chamber,” Klimesh said. “This is one of those decisions that is going to affect pipeline companies, again, far beyond CO2 pipeline companies and places an onerous burden on them to ascertain and achieve this coverage.” 
Klimesh also worried that enactment language in the bill would open the door to lawsuits from Iowans who have already signed an easement contract with the state when Summit is not longer able to uphold that contract without eminent domain to complete the project. 
“I’m concerned about putting the state of Iowa and our taxpayers at a legal risk,” Klimesh said. 
“This bill sets up a whole avalanche of potential bad policy. While we were trying to squash a fly, we took a nuclear bomb to it.”
Taylor said senators tried to swap HF 639 for a different version, via the Democrats’ amendment, but “it was rejected out of hand.” 
“So it makes me wonder if it wasn’t really just any opposition to tampering with the Summit pipeline, rather than the particulars of 639,” Taylor said.
Taylor said the group of GOP senators who stepped forward to push for a debate on this faced criticism for doing that, but Taylor said he was standing for Republican values and the motto of Iowa.

“When it says our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain, there’s not an asterisk there,” he said. “It doesn’t say unless we’re threatened by a billion dollar lawsuit.” 
Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, said he was “flummoxed” that the Democrat’s amendment was turned down, because it made the argument “really simple.”
“You can be for the pipeline, you can be for ethanol production, you can be for union workers putting that pipeline together, and say, ‘we can do this without having to use eminent domain,’” Zimmer said. 
Klimesh said when he met with the 12 senators who pushed for a debate on the bill, he offered to work with them and to amend the bill to resemble HF 943, but the group declined. 
“In that week’s time, we could have sat around and crafted probably a much better piece of legislation,” Klimesh said. 
Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said “hogwash” and that there was an opportunity for a cleaner bill on the floor and the majority chose to ignore it. 
Sen. Tony Bisignano, D-Des Moines, criticized the majority party for not working on the bill sooner.
“Where have you been? This bill didn’t start a week ago … we’ve had years,” Bisignano said. 
Sen. Dan Zumbach, R-Ryan, said “emotions got ahead of reality” on the issue and as a result, the body is stuck with “horrible” legislation.
“This bill is about killing a project, not about constitutionality, not about property rights — we missed that boat, folks,” Zumbach said. “Had it laid out there in front of us and we were too stubborn to listen to the actual words.”
Bousselot said in his closing comments on the bill that everyone will leave the Capitol Monday claiming they “voted to protect private property rights” because everyone either voted for his amendment, or for the bill. 
“I hope we have a plan for infrastructure, to grow our state, for the jobs that are going to be harder to build, for the farmers that produce the wealth and the great crops and commodities that we rely on,” Bousselot said. 
The bill advanced from the Senate and will now go to Gov. Kim Reynolds for final approval. Reynolds has not said publicly whether she would sign or veto it. Summit Carbon Solutions did not respond to a request for comment.
Reactions 
Kathy Stockdale, a landowner from Iowa Falls, said she was happy to see the bill pass and was “extremely proud” of the 12 GOP senators who took a stand to force the legislation to come to a vote. At the same time, Stockdale said she was “deeply upset” as a Republican with Senate leadership, and that she and many landowners would have preferred to see House File 943 pass.
“It doesn’t protect our private property rights,” she said.
However, she said the bill passed does provide some benefits to landowners: “It helps us in the IUC hearings. It does provide insurance for us. … It defines what a common carrier is, just like in South Dakota.”
While the measure passed the Senate, she said she is not sure it will be signed by Reynolds.
Thomson and Holt, who led the legislation in the House, hugged and shook hands with activists and landowners outside the Senate chambers after the bill’s passage.
Holt said Bousselot talking about being supportive of property rights was “disrespectful” considering his role in similar bills stalling in the Senate in recent sessions.
“Everybody that’s followed this knows that it has been Senator Bousselot, who formerly worked for Summit, who killed these pieces of legislation over and over again,” Holt said. “It’s so disingenuous and so disrespectful treating the citizens of Iowa like fools, so it was not a proud moment for me as a Republican.”
Holt said the bill’s Senate passage Monday was because of landowners and supporters who worked for three years to push lawmakers to vote on the bill. He also credited House Republicans for introducing and passing measures in response to these calls in recent legislative sessions.
“We listened to the people of Iowa, and that is why this finally got done,” Holt said. “That is why the governor needs to sign it just as soon as possible.”

Was it not Republican President Roosevelt who said, “Walk softly and carry a big stick”?
Nothing draws out the juices of the opposition more than self-aggrandizing displays of one’s own importance and power. A hyperbolic display of U.S. military might with a tank and artillery parade on the streets of D.C. would have been anathema to Roosevelt – and every former U.S. President.
In 1969, Soviet leader Leonard Brezhnev was acting to solidify his control over the Russian Politburo and leaders of its east-European satellites. I witnessed, first hand, a Soviet-style military “parade” of weapons, celebrating the 20th anniversary of communist East Germany (the GDR).  
October 7, 1969, countless, awesome tanks and extraordinarily elongated artillery thundered deafeningly down Karl-Marx-Allee as testimony to the mighty munitions of the U.S.S.R. during the Cold War. In the face of such massive machinery, I felt small and inconsequential. 
Thinking back, dehumanization was the point. 
The sound was deafening. It contrasted sharply with the temperate, enjoyable parades in my own country, where flowered floats, acrobatic clowns, beauty queens, veterans of foreign wars and local civic leaders strolled down Main streets to celebrate America. Unsusceptible to the intended arousal of fear or dread, my thoughts inclined toward, “I will be returning to school in the United States in a few months, where it is not necessary to display a show of military force to feel the power undergirding our society.” For all that show of hubris, a mere 20 years later the U.S.S.R. would cede control of East Germany to West Germany in unification under democratic governance.
Today’s military show-offs are North Korea, China and, again, Russia. Seeing their military parades on TV, I know what spectators experience who are in thrall to the absolute power of their governments. I had only to experience it once to remember it forever.
The U.S. Army is working on plans to celebrate its 250th year anniversary on June 14. President Trump has re-initiated his first-term intention to hold a full-throttled, military-style parade in Washington D.C. on that day. Both ABC and NBC News report the parade will involve 150 war-ready tanks and infantry vehicles of  30-70 tons, 50 military aircraft and 6,600 uniformed soldiers moving through the streets of Washington D.C. – costing upwards of $45 million dollars.
This is a terrible idea. Allowing this to happen, even once, would affect the perception of America as a non-aggressive nation. The U.S. military protects our country, but it remains one aspect of an incredible, comprehensive society. Featuring military might, ostentatiously, diminishes the significance of other aspects of our economy and our culture that made the United States so impressive. 
U.S. Army leaders in Trump’s previous term successfully resisted Trump’s push for a similar, multi-million-dollar display of force in the nation’s capital. This time, individual citizens need to resist the President, through their Congressional representatives.
A parade of weaponry on the scale anticipated flies in the face of the radical, ostensibly cost-saving maneuvers by DOGE that eviscerated a staggering number of federal agencies over the past 100 days.  A $45 million dollar parade, incurred on the heels of firing thousands of federal employees and cancellation of too many beneficial federal programs affecting Connecticut, would be an affront to the thousands laid-off and the abolishment of what was – for many – their life’s work.

Community organizers, nonprofit leaders, educators, and parents have come together in support of one powerful belief: the solution exists to closing Connecticut’s academic achievement gap, one of the largest in the nation.
That solution is high-dosage tutoring —a proven, research-backed approach that delivers real, measurable results and has the potential to reach all students. The intervention should be celebrated. But instead, it has been put in jeopardy of being completely discarded.
The most recent Appropriations Budget voted on recently eliminated funding for high dosage tutoring. With the legislative season winding down, the clock is ticking for government leaders to make a critical decision: do right by Connecticut’s kids, reverse this decision, and reincorporate funds for high dosage tutoring, or make families suffer through another school year of learning loss and classroom struggles.
The most recent 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores, also known as the “Nation’s Report Card,” revealed that, compared with national averages, Connecticut’s fourth-grade students outperformed their peers in reading and scored on par in mathematics. Connecticut’s eighth-grade students outperformed the nation in both subjects. At first glance, the findings are commendable, even inspiring. Dig a little deeper, though, and you’ll find that instead of getting A’s and B’s on this “report card,” many Connecticut students are sending out an SOS.
Connecticut may be outperforming other states, but unfortunately our nation’s academic health doesn’t set a high bar. The 2024 NAPE results show that in both reading and math, most fourth- and eighth- graders still performed below 2019 pre-pandemic levels. In Connecticut, the percentage of students who performed at or above the NAEP Proficient level was just 36% in 2024. This percentage was not significantly different from that in 2022 (35%) and was smaller than that in 1998 (43%). Lastly, Black and Hispanic students and students from low-income backgrounds make-up less than 25% of Connecticut’s on-track students. Too many of Connecticut’s students are still getting left behind, but it doesn’t have to be this way.
High-dosage tutoring is a proven solution to one of our most pressing challenges: how to ensure that every child – regardless of background, zip code or circumstances —can build the skills they need to succeed in school and beyond. A series of research released in the last decade reveals that high-dosage tutoring can  accelerate learning by up to ten months in a single year, is one of the most effective ways to increase achievement for students from lower-income families,  and can even be as successful done virtually as it has been in-person
Across Connecticut, schools have piloted high dosage tutoring programs grounded in best practices and  research —frequent sessions, consistent tutors, and small groups create an undeniable impact. Students who were falling behind are now catching up. Children who needed a challenge are now thriving. Confidence is rising. Scores are moving in the right direction. Teachers are seeing the difference. So are families.
Students in Teach For America’s Ignite tutoring program are reporting academic growth, a stronger sense of belonging, and greater attendance. And tutoring isn’t just a win for students, it’s a win for the state. As Connecticut continues to struggle with a teacher shortage, tutoring initiatives have helped strengthen the tutor-to-teacher talent pipeline, giving those interested in education an avenue to further pursue their passion and consider a full-time career in the classroom. An investment in high dosage tutoring is an investment in the future, creating jobs, supporting young professionals, and building a pipeline of future educators in a time of critical shortage.
Support for high-dosage tutoring extends far beyond the classroom. Behind this progress is growing interest and momentum across many sectors. The coalition described above has brought together data and lived experience—advocating with lawmakers, communicating across public, digital forums, and testifying at the Capitol. This growing collective voice, in partnership with concerned lawmakers and members of the Education committee, has led to a real step forward: a dedicated line in the state budget for high-dosage tutoring. Now, we must raise our voices, call our legislators, and share our stories. We must insist that Connecticut reinvest in this intervention and stop this progress from being erased.
Without funding, our children’ s progress risks stalling out.  Without investment, we lose momentum and the opportunity to close persistent gaps to ensure all Connecticut students have a real chance to thrive. The evidence is clear: high-dosage tutoring is as close to a magic wand as we have right now, able to erase years of academic decline. Now it’s up to legislators to back it with budget and give communities the funds they need so that the wand can be waved.
Let’s fill the line. Let’s fund what works. Let’s give every child in Connecticut the chance to reach their full potential.

Suicidality, severe anxiety, major depression, self-harm. For anyone counting, that is a massive increase in behavioral health visits by Medicaid-covered children since the Hartford Courant ran a front page story on emergency room crowding in 2007. Thirteen thousand visits to EDs that are often crowded with other people in crisis; children in chairs, carrels, and even gurneys; parents anxiously watching the clock as the daylight hours turn to night. 
This may feel familiar. That’s because every five years or so a spike of press coverage about children stuck in emergency rooms has pushed this issue to the front burner and spurred some modest policy improvements. Yet here we are again. And there they are: children with acute behavior health needs spending the night in the ED and parents reluctantly shuttling between home and hospital, praying for an answer to come the next day.


What’s going on here? Why are these key indicators of children’s behavioral health getting worse over time? And what do we need to do to make it better? I am encouraged by the work of the state’s new Transforming Children’s Behavioral Health Taskforce, which has recommended increased investment in children’s mental health services. Legislators will need to heed the TCB’s recommendation, but our state will need to do much more to meet our kids’ needs. 
Having gone through this often and recently, Connecticut can learn some lessons about how to make things better:
We’ll get what we pay for. Chronic underinvestment in behavioral health has resulted in predictable waiting lists, labyrinthine paths to care, and decimated workforces. We need Medicaid rates that cover the actual cost of care; a reasonable and regular rate-setting structure, and a quality improvement structure to track progress in utilization and healthcare outcomes.  
The state must have a strategy to ensure that services are equally available to all children, no matter how they are insured. Good models exist for this; we just have to implement them. Healthcare spending rules must be flexible enough so that money can be spent on a child’s whole family and address health-related social needs – where research says we get the most bang for our healthcare dollar. The state must have a strategic, monitored, and accountable plan for workforce development from high schools to vocational schools to colleges to licensing frameworks.
Improving treatment options won’t be enough. Behavioral health is tied to healthy development. There are not enough social workers or outpatient clinics in all the land to eliminate the stressors and anxieties our kids (and families) are reporting. 
Children who are hungry or who have unstable housing or who can’t access afterschool activities because of a lack of familial resources or adequate transportation will spend their days worrying and reacting, not learning and thriving. Behavioral health starts with meeting children’s basic needs in the community and providing opportunities for them to flourish.
Connecticut must have a Children and Families Agenda. We must create a comprehensive vision for health, education, and wellness in this state (and in this country), and reject policies that lurch us from one spending cycle to the next. 
State leadership is good at talking about out our generational vision for debt reduction, which is good! But we must bring that same energy to a generational plan for thriving communities—where every child in Connecticut is well-housed, well-educated, healthy, and engaged in meaningful community activity and relationships. This will not happen on its own, as we can see with deteriorating academic and mental health outcomes for our children. We must set out our north star and ensure that biennial budgets are moving us closer to our vision.
Every day in policy and politics we must ask ourselves, what kind of world do we want to build? Our policy, and indeed our core value as a state, should be that healthy thriving children are our priority, and we should be willing to invest in making that value a reality.
Over 13,000 trips to the Emergency Department for Connecticut children in crisis—our children. They are waiting for us to act.

Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature's Appropriations Committee. May 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers gave second-round approval Monday to a series of budget bills for the next two years, moving one stage away from closing a projected deficit of more than half-a-billion dollars.
The mainline budget bills, Legislative Bills 261 and 264, dominated debate Monday with a handful of changes. Other budget bills to appropriate additional funds to agencies for this fiscal year (LB 260) and to appropriate salaries for state senators (LB 262) and constitutional officers (LB 263) advanced last week with little debate.
Also advancing Monday were LB 513, from State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, to give all judges in the state a 1.5% salary increase in each of the next two years, and LB 534, from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, to cover about $2 million in legal claims against the state.
  Speaker John Arch of La Vista. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
With no further amendments expected, lawmakers will vote one last time on the budget bills Thursday, the final day to pass the budget, and send them to Gov. Jim Pillen, according to a scheduling announcement by Speaker John Arch of La Vista. Lawmakers will have $1.1 million to spare.
However, using the one-time fixes in cash fund sweeps and borrowing from the state’s “rainy day fund” to close the budget gap for the next two-year budget mean that lawmakers for the following biennium would be at least $110 million in the hole, current projections indicate.
Pillen retains his veto pen, including for line items, which could change the final figures. It takes 30 votes to override a veto.
The narrow positive balance will make it difficult to pass other senator priority bills this year with a revenue impact or cost, such as to reduce the state’s inheritance tax (LB 468), ban most tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products in the state (LB 316) or crack down on adversarial nations’ “agents” (LB 644).
‘I’m pleased with the results’
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, confirmed the hundreds of millions of dollars moved to close the projected deficit through June 30, 2027 — in cash fund transfers, reduced spending and taking from the state’s “rainy day” fund — is the most he’s seen in his ninth year on the committee.
He said appropriators shifted hundreds of millions of dollars in 2017, too, but had more time to respond, rather than this year’s “devastating” economic forecast that came in April.
“I’m pleased with the results of the budget,” Clements said after the debate. “I’m glad that we have a balanced budget again.”

When lawmakers returned in January, they faced a projected $433 million shortfall for the next two years, a number that has since grown. Lawmakers have shifted funds or cut spending by $850 million to cover the deficit since it was identified last November.
A large part of the deficit, but not all, came because the state’s economy, measured by per capita income, is doing well compared to other states. As a result, the federal government pulled back on the percentage of Medicaid costs it covers in Nebraska, passing on a cost of about $55 million this fiscal year and nearly $300 million next year.
‘We have cooked the books’
Blame for the remaining deficit largely differs by political ideology in the Legislature, with conservatives blaming shaky economic forecasts and progressives, such as State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, blaming “inequitable, unaffordable tax cuts” passed in 2023.
By Jan. 1, 2027, Nebraska’s income tax rate for corporations and for individuals making $18,000 or more will fall to 3.99%. At that point, there will be three individual tax tiers, rather than four.
Conrad blamed Pillen and his legislative allies for the tax cuts, stating the economic forecasts are not like a “weather forecast” and that economic projections are lower “not by fluke, not by accident, not by surprise, but by design.” She said “chickens are coming home to roost.”
  State Sens. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha. May 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a member of the Appropriations Committee, alleged Clements and other committee members didn’t do their work or properly vet all the proposals before the Legislature. Instead, she said, senators gave a “rubber stamp” to many budget cuts and fund transfers that Pillen and his staff requested.
“We have cooked the books,” Cavanaugh said. “This isn’t real. This isn’t real money.”
Echoing Cavanaugh, State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, a freshman on the Appropriations Committee, cautioned that one budget-balancing measure — sweeping an estimated $24 million in unspent agency funds by this June 30 — also isn’t reality. She said at least $7 million of those funds intended to be swept from the Nebraska Department of Education are already obligated and will be spent.
‘Let’s focus on real numbers’
However, State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte told colleagues not to get “too carried away” on what he termed as “demagoguing” of “the sky is falling.” He pointed to possibly rosier forecasts in the state’s future that opponents rejected as natural wage growth.
Clements, too, has said lawmakers knew getting to 2027 would be a “pinch point.”
“Let’s focus on real numbers. Let’s focus on the numbers we know,” Jacobson said.
Conrad, a former eight-year member of the Appropriations Committee, said she was “intimately familiar” with the budget and told Jacobson and others she would “not be mansplained by anybody in this body how the state budget works.”
  State Sens. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and Ben Hansen of Blair. April 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair described what he viewed as a federal “carrot becoming a stick” for state spending cuts and that lawmakers should be looking at “tightening our belts as best we can.” He noted federal proposals in Congress to cut spending, particularly to Medicaid.
“It’s not about tightening our belt, as it is, we might be having to lop off limbs in order to help pay for our budget,” Hansen said of the future.
Cavanaugh has suggested lawmakers might need to come back for a special session, which some Republicans rejected publicly but quietly acknowledged is possible. If state revenues don’t bounce back, lawmakers who are set to adjourn in less than a month could be back sooner than next January. 
After the budget bills pass, Pillen has set his sights on additional property tax relief that, with the final budget balance, would likely only come with increased sales or “sin” tax revenue, such as through currently exempt goods or services, a proposal that failed to gain traction last summer.
Nebraska Supreme Court increase
Throughout Monday, the budget deficit fluctuated as lawmakers approved final cash transfers and additional spending. Lawmakers closed the last remaining gap by taking $5 million more from the state’s “rainy day” cash fund.
“It’s the ‘rainy day’ fund, and folks, it’s raining,” said State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, who secured $3 million more for the Nebraska Supreme Court.
  State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, center. March 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Holdcroft framed his proposal as investing in the Nebraska Supreme Court’s “core judicial services that are delivering results” and uplifting public safety, such as problem-solving courts and probation services that court officials said could be in jeopardy without additional funds.
Problem-solving courts are intensive court programs bringing individuals and families together with one-on-one interactions with judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys, law enforcement, court officials and more to help Nebraskans.
This includes Adult Drug and DUI Courts, Veterans Treatment Courts, Reentry Courts, Juvenile Drug Courts, Young Adult Courts, Mental Health Courts and Family Treatment Courts.
Each year, it costs the state about $4,400 per participant in problem-solving courts, Holdcroft said, compared to $41,000 for incarceration.
Clements and State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk said the courts had enough funds for the next year, citing the Legislative Fiscal Office, but that if the courts needed additional funds, officials could request more funding in January for the following fiscal year.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, an attorney, said that even if that was true, the fiscal office doesn’t make policy. He told senators to listen to county attorneys and others “who are running around like their hair is on fire” to promote a “need,” not a “want.”

Holdcroft said he understood that all senators were looking for ways to close spending but that they needed to distinguish between “cost savings” and “cost shifting,” which he said would fall to county jails, emergency responders, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services and families or communities “already under stress.”
If the programs were cut, Holdcroft said, the people who need the programs “don’t disappear.”
“They simply fall through the cracks into more expensive and less effective systems,” Holdcroft. “If we let that happen, we are not saving the state money. We are making the problem worse and paying more for it down the line.”
Affordable and workforce housing
State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse also made a deal to take $8 million out of the state’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund to preserve $4 million each in the Middle Income Workforce Housing Fund and the Rural Workforce Housing Fund.
Hallstrom said some projects in the workforce housing funds were put “in limbo” with the pending cuts, echoing Dover that “a house built today is much better than delaying the building of that house until a later time.”
“I will pledge to use whatever is at my disposal to try and avoid the ultimate transfer a couple years down the road from this fund,” Hallstrom said.
Conrad said lawmakers budget for two years, not one, and shouldn’t “backfill.”
Domestic violence services
Another major change, but not to the state’s bottom line, came in Bosn earning support for $3 million in each of the next two years to support domestic violence services for survivors.
Bosn said the “life-saving interventions” are required under state law but that it has been a “critical funding failure” as a previous “fix” fell short in actually getting dollars to survivors. She said federal funding in this area has also been cut.
“This amendment is about making sure survivors are not turned away,” Bosn said.

Conrad, in a tense exchange with Bosn, asked whether she voted for Trump and envisioned the cuts coming. Bosn said she did vote for Trump but didn’t expect the cuts.
State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln had brought similar legislation this year, LB 348, seeking to find a long-term fix for domestic violence services.
The solution fell on the Medicaid Managed Care Excess Profit Fund, a cash fund that collects excess Medicaid dollars for use in other areas, such as supporting new moms and babies.
However, that’s the same fund that Clements and a majority of his committee targeted for $10 million to help rightsize the budget.
Taken together with Bosn’s changes and others this session, fiscal estimates show the fund would be depleted next fiscal year for a variety of services.
Other changes
In other changes to the state’s main budget, State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha clarified that lawmakers could sweep only $4 million in unspent funds for work on broadband, rather than a planned $5 million transfer. Clements and State Sen. Mike Moser of Columbus, chair of the Legislature’s Transportation and Telecommunications Committee, confirmed the situation.
DeBoer identified the error Monday morning after continuing to review a last-minute “murder sheet” of additional cuts last week.
“If this was a road, I’d be all over it,” Moser said, praising DeBoer.

State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil restored $264,488 of a larger planned cut to Educational Service Units in a 42-0 vote. An earlier amendment from Murman that didn’t specify where the funds would come from failed 17-26 before he refiled the amendment to use general funds. 
Murman, chair of the Education Committee, said ESUs might have made up the cut by increasing property taxes.
Dover secured $1 million for the Robert B. Daugherty Water for Food Global Institute at the University of Nebraska “to support water and agricultural research and existing collaborative initiatives to implement best practices in water conservation.” A vote to preserve the funding in committee stalled 4-4, with Dover missing the vote for a doctor’s appointment.
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, chair of the Revenue Committee, said the state funding was critical in the public-private partnership to not “run-off” private investors.

Clements said that NU could find the funding elsewhere as he noted its set to get more than $13 million more in the next biennium, which is less than the NU Board of Regents requested. NU President Jeffrey Gold has said tuition increases could be in the future.
Lawmakers rejected an amendment from Conrad, to restore $500,000 in a Nebraska State Patrol cash fund for equipment, and State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, to continue diverting at least $20 million in interest from the proposed new state prison and proposed Perkins County Canal to economic recovery.
McKinney said the previous deal was transferring interest for three years, not two, and that “a deal is a deal and a deal should be honored.”

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)State officials and health care advocates worry that many Marylanders on Medicaid could lose coverage under a recent proposal from congressional Republicans that aims to cut billions in federal dollars by tightening program eligibility and other administrative hurdles.
While state officials are still determining the full scope of the GOP proposal unveiled Sunday night, they anticipate that a “significant” portion of Maryland’s 1.55 million Medicaid recipients could lose coverage under the current proposal.
“No matter how you slice it, we’re going to see the most vulnerable in our communities lose health coverage,” said U.S. Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd).
In an attempt to find $880 billion in federal savings, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce released language for a budget reconciliation bill that would make hefty changes to the Medicaid eligibility process when people enroll or reenroll in the program.
Ryan Moran, the Maryland Department of Health deputy secretary who focuses on Medicaid, said the proposal gives the department a clearer idea of how the Trump administration plans to cut federal funding to Medicaid — but many questions remain on the total impact to Maryland’s Medicaid population.
Report: Up to 100,000 Marylanders could lose coverage if Medicaid imposes work requirements

“This has been something that … has long been discussed since the election of the Trump administration,” Moran said. “Now that … there is text to actually react to, that is the work that we will be going through over the next couple days to understand in more detail.”
Medicaid is a health care program that is jointly funded by state and federal dollars to help lower-income households and certain other populations receive health coverage. About 25% of Marylanders receive health care through Medicaid.
There are several components to the proposal that could affect Maryland’s Medicaid operations, such as language to restrict federal Medicaid dollars from going to certain abortion providers or gender-affirming care for youths. The proposal also would restrict a state’s ability to tax health care providers to help fund the state’s share of Medicaid.
In addition, the proposal would cut federal funding from states that use their own money to help provide health care coverage for undocumented residents. Moran said that the department is evaluating how that language could affect some of Maryland’s Medicaid programs that undocumented individuals could benefit from.
As for Medicaid recipients, the budget reconciliation proposal calls for work requirements for people to stay enrolled in the program. The proposal exempts students, family caregivers, people with disabilities and some other cases.
The budget reconciliation proposal also requires that recipients prove eligibility for Medicaid every six months opposed to the current annual redetermination process.
These two factors combined, plus other tightened eligibility requirements, would likely mean that many Marylanders would have to jump through hoops to get health care coverage through Medicaid, and some will likely fall through the cracks.
“Ultimately, what ends up happening is that individuals don’t go through the red tape to actually enroll in coverage,” Moran said. “So, it really does lead to a loss of coverage for individuals … who would otherwise be eligible.
“It’s making it harder for people to enroll. Fewer people do enroll, and that has dramatic, significant impacts on the health care ecosystem,” he said. “But it does, in the end, provide the federal savings that you were looking for — by having fewer enrollments into the program.”
U.S. House GOP mandates Medicaid work requirements in giant bill slashing spending

The proposed budget would also require significant state resources to conduct the increased eligibility checks for the 1.55 million Marylanders on Medicaid, which will likely “put a burden on Maryland’s system,” said Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society.
Sen. Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, added that there could be additional downstream effects – such as additional strain on the state’s already extended emergency room wait times, which are some of the highest in the nation. With more uninsured people, she said, there will be more Marylanders receiving health care in emergency rooms.
“Emergency rooms will be more crowded than they already are,” Beidle said.
While the state works through the details of Sunday’s proposals, Moran noted that it is still early in the legislative process and there could be changes down the line – for better or worse for the state.
“This is the first take” Moran said. “This is the start of a process that we will be watching over the course of the next few months. Just because things are included as proposals today, that doesn’t mean there couldn’t be other changes or amendments.”

Ryan Nawrocki (R-Baltimore County). (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)For a few short minutes, it appeared that there might be a contentious intraparty challenge for a state Senate seat.
Del. Ryan Nawrocki (R-Baltimore County), elected in 2022, posted ever so briefly on social media that he was holding a May 19 fundraiser for the Senate — the same seat currently held by Sen. J.B Jennings (R-Baltimore and Harford counties), who was elected to his fourth Senate term in 2022 and previously served eight years in the House of Delegates.
“I have no intention of running for Senate,” Nawrocki said in a phone interview Monday. “It just kind of, there was some fat-finger stuff that happened there, and I posted something, and I immediately changed it.”
But not before the texts and phone calls to Nawrocki, Jennings and reporters started flying.
“I’ve seen the screenshot, you know, 17 times. You probably got it from the same people who sent it to me,” Nawrocki said. “First of all … if I’m running for Senate, I’m not announcing it in a throwaway line seven lines deep in a post on Facebook.”
The post pitched an event in Middle River and “an evening you won’t want to miss — great local brews, fantastic food and an important cause: supporting our campaign for Maryland State Senate.”
  Sen. J.B. Jennings said he intends on running for a fifth term in the Senate in 2026. (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
The new post, as of 9:23 a.m., replaced the Senate announcement with “supporting our campaign for Maryland!”
Jennings, for his part, said he was surprised by the post and the calls and texts he got alerting him to a potential challenge.
“This kind of caught me off-guard this morning on what he wrote in his Facebook post. I have not talked to him,” Jennings said. “I thought we were all going to run together.”
The post touched off chatter about a larger play by the newly recognized, hard-right Freedom Caucus in the Maryland House.
Nawrocki is one of nine members of the caucus. Currently, there are no members in the Senate. Some have speculated that the caucus might seek to primary an incumbent senator. At events this session, members of the caucus have talked openly, if not vaguely, about RINO — Republican in Name Only — lawmakers.
Jennings’ district, a safe one for Republicans, seems a likely choice for a primary challenge. All four state lawmakers are Republicans. Dels. Lauren Arikan and Kathy Szeliga are also members of the Freedom Caucus.
Arikan, a second-term Republican, wrote in a text message that she was not planning a run for Jennings’ seat. She said she was “not aware of any changes” in the district.

Szeliga, in her fourth term in the House, also said she is not interested in a run for Senate.
“I am very focused on holding Democrats accountable for $1.66 billion in taxes. Not running against Jennings,” Szeliga said in a text, adding that she is “very concened about Democrats raising taxes again in October,” in a potential special session.
Nawrocki, for his part, repeated that he would not run against Jennings “not even in six months.”
“I’m not running for Senate,” Nawrocki said. “Unless you’re calling to tell me that J.B. is running for governor or something like that, and then maybe I would consider it. But no, I’m not running against J.B.”

Barron, a former state delegate and the first Black U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland, has a new gig at a law firm in Washington, D.C.
Barron will work for the white-collar defense and government investigations practice at Mintz, where he will lead the firm’s crisis management and strategic response team that will include civil, criminal, and regulatory matters.
“Erek is a highly respected lawyer with an impressive background both in public service and private practice,” Bob Bodian, Mintz’s managing member, said in a statement Monday. “His extensive experience in high-stakes litigation, investigations, and corporate matters — combined with his various high-level positions in government — will bring immediate value to our clients across a broad range of industries.”
Besides being recognized for its work on technology, biotech and life sciences, the firm’s website said it was one of 765 U.S. businesses get to a perfect score of 100 from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation on its Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion.
“The firm has a commitment to core values which includes diversity, and absolutely something that is important to me,” Barron said in a brief interview Monday. “I’m glad to be at a place that sticks by its principles.”

Barron said he began working last week at the firm, where he expects some of the work to mirror work he did as U.S. attorney from October 2021 until he resigned February.
Barron was nominated by President Joe Biden (D) and made history as the first Black U.S. attorney for Maryland when he was confirmed.
“We tackled a lot of big, complex problems across the board in the legal space, civil and criminal, touching nearly every substantive area of the law,” Barron said of his time as U.S. attorney.
In one of the biggest cases of his tenure, the office charged three people in January 2024 for a nearly $2 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme. Brenda Chunga of Severna Park pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud in connection with scheme, in which she allegedly received at least $3 million in proceeds.
Prosecutors charge that Sam Lee, living in the United Arab Emirates, cofounded Hyperfund with Rodney Burton of Miami. The two, with Chunga, promoted the company and sold investment contracts through HyperFund’s online investment platform between June 2020 and November 2022, but began to block investor withdrawals as early as July 2021.
In December 2024, Barron’s office announced the convictions of two people who lied to investors on the development of drugs to treat COVID-19 and HIV drugs by a publicly traded biotechnology company called CytoDyn Inc. A release from the office said Nader Pourhassan of Lake Oswego, Oregon, received more than $340,000 from sales of CytoDyn stock and Kazem Kazempour of Potomac received $4.4 million personally and his company received more than $22 million.
Prior to his work as U.S. attorney, Barron worked with then-Sen. Joe Biden from 2007 to 2009 as counsel and policy adviser on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs.
Barron, who also worked as a partner at the D.C. firm of Whiteford Taylor & Preston, represented Prince George’s County’s 24th District in the House of Delegates from January 2015 to October 2021.

He co-chaired a work group to assess budget and safety problems with Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and served on the state’s Justice Reinvestment Coordinating Council. Its work to assess and improve the state’s sentencing and corrections practices led to the Justice Reinvestment Act in 2016.
Less than a week after Barron resigned from the U.S. attorney’s office, he was honored by his former colleagues in the General Assembly in both chambers.
“Having known Erek for over two decades, I am confident that his leadership, collaborative approach, and successful track record in both the public and private sectors will be a tremendous asset to our D.C. office and to Mintz overall,” said Michelle Lipkowitz, managing member of the firm’s D.C. office.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5723-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-13 00:01:07.803545

Wes Moore (D) watches a passing high-speed maglev train on April 12, 2025, during a trade mission to Japan. (Photo by Ken Katsurayama/Governor's Office)As the president and chief operating officer of Northeast Maglev, I can appreciate why there remains a degree of skepticism about the future of high-speed rail in Maryland. At this time, we do not have high speed rail anywhere in America.
While recent polls have revealed widespread majority public support for Maglev project throughout Maryland, I also respect the concern that exists within certain communities about the basic characteristics of this project – from routing specifics, potential for environmental impacts, to the perceived, but unfounded concern of disruption to local homes and businesses (The high cost of high speed: Why SCMaglev is not the answer – Maryland Matters)
These are natural questions that accompany any new road or transit project, and they are particularly understandable in a project of this size and magnitude. Throw in the fact that this would be the first project of its kind in North America – that is, a rail project powered by green energy, floating on air via magnetic levitation, and traveling at a speed of 311 mph – it is easy to see why this proposal has inspired healthy discussion and debate.

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of projects like these before allowing them to proceed. Our federal and state governments engage local communities in open forums, provide transparent information about the project, answer questions, and allow adequate time for public comment.
It is a thorough and time-consuming process, and deservedly so. The Northeast Maglev project will change the way Marylanders live, work and travel. It will redefine the economy of our state and those along the eastern seaboard. It will transform the manner in which Americans perceive public transportation.
For these reasons, and for the preservation of the special quality of historic communities and neighborhoods throughout the region, it is imperative that we get this right.
Until the environmental review process has been completed, with one preferred alignment designated by the Federal Railroad Administration, and while the majority of Marylanders support the construction of the project, some members of our community will remain uncertain, and a project that will make life so much better for millions will remain on the “slow train” to completion.
Here is what we know. The Northeast Maglev project, when built, will make it possible for people to travel from Washington to Baltimore-Washington International Airport to Baltimore in 15 minutes, and from Washington to New York in just one hour, including all the cities and airports in between.
In so doing, it will substantially relieve traffic gridlock, improve the environment, reduce air pollution, create jobs and positively impact people’s lives in one of the most congested regions of our country.
This project has never asked for state taxpayer money; in fact, it has paid all matching funds to the federal government that the state would have had to pay to even study a project like this. It will be built with a combination of private investment, federal loan funding programs and international financing.
We know, based on the NEPA studies, that this project will create about 123,000 construction-related jobs, 38,000 professional jobs and 1,500 permanent jobs, while adding $8.8 billion in wages and salaries to the Maryland region’s economy.
It will also remove 16 million cars from our clogged highways between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., which not only improves our quality of life but also reduces greenhouse gases in our state. Studies have shown that Marylanders lose over 100 hours a year stuck in traffic, and this project will go a long way to help alleviate this.
It is my hope that our federal and state governments can come together and finish the environmental review process. Only by doing so can we begin to provide definitive answers and a timetable that the public deserves with a final single alignment, and move toward the completion of a project our state so urgently needs.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/day1_067-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-13 00:01:07.803545

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska regulators have assessed a $49,000 fine against Hilcorp for lapses in Cook Inlet offshore well management.
The Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission said on Monday that Hilcorp, the dominant operator in the Cook Inlet basin, failed to meet an annual deadline to discuss its well plugging and abandonment activities. That annual meeting was to have taken place on Dec. 1, the AOGCC said in its order. The earliest date that Hilcorp offered for the meeting was Feb. 17, according to the order.
Hilcorp acknowledged missing the deadline but submitted some written information to address the commission’s concerns and “to ensure all conditions of approval are complied with in the future,” the order said.
The company has 20 days to contest the assessed penalty, the order said.
It was the first enforcement action taken by the AOGCC against Hilcorp this year, according to the commission’s records.
In 2024, however, Hilcorp was the subject of five separate AOGCC orders concerning violations on both the North Slope and in the Cook Inlet basin. The three North Slope cases resulted in penalties of $452,100, $260,477 and $55,000, while the two Cook Inlet cases resulted in fines of $86,000 and $50,000.
Hilcorp, a privately held independent based in Texas, has become one of the two biggest oil producers in Alaska. The company gained that position after taking over fields and assets previously held by BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. BP left Alaska in 2020.
In comparison, ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc., the other major Alaska oil producer, has been the subject of far fewer AOGCC enforcement actions. There were none taken against ConocoPhillips in 2024.
In 2023, however, ConocoPhillips received one of the biggest fines ever assessed by the AOGCC. The commission ordered the company to pay $913,796.80 for numerous violations that led to a 2022 well blowout and release of natural gas in the Alpine oil field.

(iStock via Getty Images Plus photo)Here it is, torn from the battered and abused pages of the Bill of Rights:
“Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.”
No question about it. We Alaskans are enthusiastic fans of the First Amendment right “peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Just the other day, April 19, over 3,000 people seeking “redress of grievances” demonstrated in downtown Anchorage carrying signs such as “Hands off the Constitution” and “Health Care is a Human Right.”
A couple months earlier, Feb. 17, Presidents Day, hundreds demonstrated all over Alaska seeking “redress of grievances.” Anchorage, Juneau, Palmer, Fairbanks, and Seward had sign-wavers galore redressing grievances. “Democracy is not a spectator sport,” “Resist,” and “No Kings” bobbed over the heads of spectators growing hoarse from chants and shouts while unabashedly assembling and making their grievances known. The democratic process is messy, dontcha know. 
And talking about “kings,” the right to assembly goes back that far. It has its roots in English history, evolving from the Magna Carta signed in 1215, to the English Bill of Rights, to the Founding Fathers and on to our Bill of Rights. We Alaskans have not been alone in the embrace of public demonstrations to pursue grievances. The Suffragettes, for example, who advocated the right of women to vote were not shy about public demonstrations. 
As the historian Mike Wallace has written:
“The twenty-third of October, 1915, was a crisp fall day, splashed with sunshine, perfect for a parade. In midafternoon tens of thousands of women clad in white dresses and yellow sashes stepped out of Washington Square. They strode up Fifth Avenue arrayed in delegations of assorted age and station — letter carriers’ wives from Queens, schoolgirls from Washington Irving High, ILGWU seamstresses, Henry Street settlement workers.”
Of course, later in the same century the Civil Rights Movement put even more feet on the pavement to air grievances about racism and inequality. On Aug. 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous “I Have a Dream” speech as part of the March on Washington. The speech was delivered to an estimated 250,000 people who came to Washington, D.C., to demonstrate for civil rights. 
So you get the idea. The principle of free speech, including the right to peaceful assembly, was so central to a successful democracy that it was the very first right in the Bill of Rights. We Americans have been using that right since the founding of this nation 248 years ago. But here in Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy would like to see an end to this First Amendment foolishness. 
Early this year, the governor introduced House Bill 71/Senate Bill 74, “An Act related to obstruction.” It appears to target large demonstrations and spontaneous demonstrations without a permit. In my view, the primary purpose of this bill is to strongly discourage Alaskans from exercising their right to peaceful assembly in the first place. Here are some of the “highlights,” so to speak:

If the protest “substantially interferes” with someone’s access to a government building, or “interferes” with an emergency responder, the offense would be a class C felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and $50,000.
A person “whose passage is obstructed” could sue a protester for $10,000 if their rights were infringed, $50,000 if their property was damaged, and $100,000 if they were personally injured — in addition to attorney’s fees and costs.

Draconian. Might be worth considering if there were a substantial history of these crimes by demonstrators in Alaska. Let’s take a look. The governor’s transmittal letter makes no mention of a history of these crimes. The bill itself makes no mention of a history of such crimes. A report submitted by the attorney general a year ago for very similar proposed legislation, House Bill 386, came up with cases in New York and Washington, D.C., where demonstrators blocked traffic, but did not report a single such case in Alaska. 
And to top it all off, an internal legal analysis conducted by the Legislative Affairs Agency for HB 386 found, among many other critical findings: 
“The bill raises issues under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and art. I, secs. 5 and 6, of the Alaska Constitution.  In particular, if challenged, there is a risk that the new crime of obstruction of free passage in public places could be found unconstitutional both facially or if applied to the protected speech of protests or demonstrations.”
Finally, this is just the tip of the iceberg of Gov. Dunleavy’s attempts to subvert constitutional protections for Alaskans. See the ACLU analysis aptly titled, “Dunleavy is the anti-First Amendment governor.”

The short route is currently served by diesel ferries like the Tokitae, seen here approaching Whidbey Island. (Photo by Tom Banse)Ferry system managers and state budget writers in Washington took a cold wave over the bow Monday upon opening the bids to construct up to five new hybrid electric ferries.
“I don’t see how you get to five. There’s money for three on a good day,” said state House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma.
The Washington Legislature previously set aside about $1.3 billion to build new ferries and charging infrastructure over the next six to eight years. New vessels are overdue to stabilize the state’s aging and sometimes unreliable ferry fleet. Simultaneously, the ferry system and the state’s Democratic leadership want to reduce the ferries’ air pollution footprint by switching to battery propulsion as much as possible.
Eastern Shipbuilding Group of Panama City, Florida, submitted the low bid for the state’s desired plug-in hybrid, 160-car vessels, according to a summary of the bids posted by WSF late on Monday. The $251 million price tag for the first ferry in the series was roughly in line with the state engineer’s in-house estimate.
Nichols Brothers Boat Builders on Whidbey Island submitted a competing bid that was considerably higher, even after including a 13% bid credit authorized by the Legislature to incentivize home state construction. Neither bid includes the expensive hybrid electric powertrains for the new ferries, which the state plans to acquire separately.
A third shipbuilder, Philly Shipyard, was expected to submit a bid, but didn’t in the end. 
The Nichols Brothers and Eastern Shipbuilding Group bids both include escalator clauses that Fey predicted “will invariably make it (the price) go up.” The escalators allow the shipyards to charge more in case of unpredictable cost increases, such as on steel or from tariffs.
Washington State Ferries said in a mass email to interested parties that it will evaluate the bid documents in greater detail for the next few weeks before awarding a contract. The agency will undoubtedly also consult further with the governor’s office and key legislators about what is affordable.
The most recent date given for delivery of the first new ferry was 2029.
“First things first, I need to understand exactly what we’ve got with the bids,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said Monday after an initial, high-level briefing. Ferguson declined to speculate more before getting additional information.
Fey said he expects to discuss where more money could potentially be found. The veteran legislator said multiple currents in the bid environment drove up costs, including rising raw material prices, tariffs and limited shipyard competition – even though the ferry system’s request for bids was opened to shipyards nationwide.
A Democratic legislator from ferry-served Bainbridge Island, Rep. Greg Nance, said he was struck by how Washington’s procurement was affected by the hollowing out of the nation’s shipbuilding industry. He was pleased there was more than one bidder.
“Given the state of shipbuilding writ large, we knew that we were swimming upstream,” Nance said in an interview Monday. “We need to do more to support shipbuilding. We’ve lost our shipbuilding edge over the past 50 years.”
Cost roughly doubled over past seven years
The 144-car Suquamish was the most recent of the workhorse Olympic-class ferries upon which the new plug-in ferry design is based. The diesel-powered Suquamish was delivered to WSF in 2018 at a cost of about $122 million. Debate about how to proceed with further vessel acquisitions in that size class has stretched from then until now. 
During this dickering, the state pivoted to electrification, costs shot up and the reliability of the existing aging fleet went down.
The bid request published by WSF included the high-level design for a plug-in ferry capable of carrying up to 160 cars and 1,500 passengers. Drawings show boats that resemble a slightly elongated version of the diesel-powered Olympic class ferries delivered between 2014 and 2018. However, the new design has just one passenger deck stacked on top of the two auto decks.
The center of the ship’s hold will be packed with racks of water-cooled rechargeable batteries so the ferry can sail fully on electric power most of the time. The engine room will also feature twin diesel generators as a backup source of propulsion power. 
Assuming they use green electricity to charge, the new ferries should achieve a large reduction in fuel consumption and an associated reduction in global warming emissions.

WSF tentatively plans to deploy the new ferries to the Mukilteo-Clinton run first, probably followed by the Seattle-Bremerton route.
What about cheaper options?
Republicans, who are in the minority in the Legislature, have pushed for a cheaper diesel ferry option to be put back on the table. WSF leaders have been consistent in warning against reverting to conventional diesel power because that would necessitate a lengthy redesign and re-bid.
“If we were to switch now to go to diesel, we would have to stop what we’re doing with the hybrid, design a new diesel boat and lose the funding from the Climate Commitment Act,” deputy WSF boss John Vezina said under questioning from state Sen. Phil Fortunato, R-Pierce County, at a Senate hearing in March. “It would probably add two years to the acquisition of those new vessels.”
BC Ferries has also been in the market for new car ferries and has been able to acquire new vessels at far lower cost than its Seattle-based neighbors. Unlike Washington State Ferries, BC Ferries can solicit bids from shipyards worldwide. The newest additions to the province’s fleet were built in Romania.
Building ferries to serve domestic U.S. routes at a foreign shipyard is prohibited under a century-old federal law known as the Jones Act. 
Of late, the Trump administration and a bipartisan contingent of lawmakers in Congress have highlighted the need to make the American shipbuilding industry more competitive. But President Donald Trump’s recent statements on the matter make no mention of jettisoning the longstanding made-in-America requirements.
Washington State Ferries currently has 21 vessels of various sizes and ages in its fleet, making it the largest public ferry system in the nation. The WSF long-range plan contains a goal to grow to 26 ferries to provide reliable service on every route, with allowances for maintenance tie-ups and a vessel in reserve. 
The hefty bids come just as it seemed the agency was sailing into smoother waters. 
This summer, the ferry system will get nearly back to operating its full pre-pandemic schedule, missing only a second boat on the Port Townsend-Coupeville run during midweeks and the long-suspended international crossing to Sidney, B.C.
Last week’s generally celebratory blog post about the summer schedule cautioned that peak-season crewing will be stretched close to the limit. Blog author Bryn Hunter said it will be challenging to find a short-term replacement whenever an aging vessel breaks down.
“I wouldn’t let this be a Debbie Downer,” Rep. Fey concluded at the end of his initial construction bid analysis. “There’s been great progress made by the ferry system over the past four years.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WSF-washington-state-ferries-ferry-boat-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-12 22:00:08.129496

It’s unlikely to be the last abortion debate in the Senate before the legislature adjourns for the year at 6 p.m. Friday. Republicans can bring the bill back to the Senate at any time in the next few days. 
Republicans spent the first hour of debate scorning Amendment 3, which voters approved in November to protect the right to reproductive health care including abortion up to the point of fetal viability. 
“Sometimes people get in, we can only describe it as horrible situations, but I don’t think taking the life of an innocent should be something that we can legally do,” said Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican. “I think it’s morally wrong and I think we need to support women who’ve had unintended pregnancies or other situations where they feel trapped and they don’t feel supported.”

After Republicans spoke in favor of the bill, Democrats stood up to block it from coming up for a vote.
The proposed ban, which has been a top priority among Republicans this year, seeks to repeal the constitutional right to an abortion but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation. 
The 12 week deadline for survivors has raised concerns from Democrats, and from the GOP leader of the House.
“It’s just disgusting to put that torture and timeline on someone who’s a survivor of domestic violence,” state Rep. Patty Lewis, a Democrat from Kansas City, said Monday evening.
 State Sen. Patty Lewis, D-Kansas City, speaks on the Missouri Senate floor Monday as part of an effort to hold off anti-abortion legislation (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The proposed ban, if approved by a simple majority of voters, would reinstate several targeted regulations on abortion providers, or TRAP laws, that were recently struck down as unconstitutional by a Missouri judge.
The language that could appear on each ballot does not mention the amendment would ban abortions, a detail that’s been highly-criticized by Democrats as deceiving. 
Missourians would be asked if they want to amend the Missouri constitution to: 

“Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; 
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and 
Protect children from gender transition?”

Missourians could see the question on the November 2026 ballot, or as soon as this year if the governor chose to call a special election on the issue. 

On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat, pointed out that last session, Senate Republicans voted against an attempt to add rape and incest exceptions to what at the time was a near-total ban on abortion in the state. 
“It makes you wonder exactly what’s going on here,” Beck said of some Republicans changing course on the issue. “ … It’s very interesting to see the mental gymnastics that are taking place to be able to say that this is OK.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051225_beck2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-12 22:00:08.129496

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A bill passed by the House Monday limiting local government’s ability to restrict fireworks use will help the state participate in President Donald Trump’s plans for major celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the U.S.’s founding in 2026, Rep. Bill Gustoff, R-Des Moines, said.
The House passed Senate File 303 with a vote of 51-39, sending it to Gov. Kim Reynolds. The bill prohibits county boards of supervisors and city councils from prohibiting or limiting the use of fireworks on July 3, 4 and Dec. 31, outside of existing regulations in Iowa Code.
State law sets certain constraints on fireworks — which are legal to use from June 1 through July 8 and Dec. 10 through Jan. 3 of each year — that outlaws the sale of fireworks to minors and the use of “display” fireworks by people or organizations outside of local approval, as well as sets certain time restrictions on fireworks.
If signed into law, it would remove ordinances or other regulations set by several Iowa localities that ban or restrict the use of fireworks, including Des Moines, Ames and Iowa City.
Gustoff, the bill’s floor manager, said lifting these local restrictions for three days a year will allow “the unwary, patriotic American in Iowa” to celebrate the nation’s founding without running the risk of breaking local law. He said this will be especially important as the country prepares to celebrate the country’s 250th anniversary. Trump has floated bringing these celebrations to the Iowa State Fairgrounds.
Trump has proposed a yearlong celebration that he said would begin at the Iowa State Fair for the “Great American State Fair” scheduled from Memorial Day 2025 to July 4, 2026.
“Mr. President, we welcome that idea in Iowa, and we’re ready, willing and able to host the party,” Gustoff said. “Iowans would want to join their fellow citizens from around the nation to celebrate the semi-quincentennial birthday of the greatest nation in history, in the world. … We need to enable Iowans to be part of that celebration.”
That includes being allowed to set off fireworks without violating local regulations, Gustoff said. However, Democrats have repeatedly expressed concerns about limiting local government’s ability to set rules on fireworks use, particularly when different communities may set these regulations to address public safety hazards.
“When I look at the list of who signed on as lobbyists, it’s striking to me that anyone concerned with public safety — firefighters, the fire marshals, the fire chiefs — are all against it, because they know what the challenges are in an urban environment,” Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner said in March. “And it should be — in my view, it also should also be a local government issue.”
Rep. Eric Gjerde, D-Cedar Rapids, introduced an amendment Monday that would prohibit “consumer fireworks for personal use.” He said that in Cedar Rapids, which has a ban on fireworks within city limits, the Cedar Rapids Fire Department received 636 calls for service for fireworks between June 1 and July 8, 2024. These included some dumpster, grass and debris fires caused by fireworks, in addition to calls from people who think the sounds of fireworks are gunshots — calls that require multiple law enforcement officers to respond and investigate.
He also brought up issues people in Iowa communities have with fireworks, like veterans who suffer from PTSD having adverse responses to fireworks going off nearby.
“When we take away the local control of cities and counties to determine what works best for them and what works best for their individuals — to me, it’s just easier to say, let’s just get rid of consumer fireworks altogether and stick with the display fireworks by our cities and our counties,” Gjerde said. “… So I think that even though we all enjoy — I enjoy a good firework display — but I also think we need to be certain that’s what’s in the best interest for everybody.”
The amendment failed.
Gustoff said fireworks have been around for thousands of years, saying there’s “no denying that they have broad-based appeal, and they’re here to stay.” The measure goes to Reynolds for final approval.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2016-07-05_032240084_1EDF3_iOS-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-05-12 22:00:08.129496

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Supporters of the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project took to the State Capitol steps Monday afternoon, urging state leaders to advance the stalled coastal restoration project. 
The Mid-Barataria project, part of the Louisiana Coastal Master Plan to rebuild wetlands with diverted sediment and water from the Mississippi River, is often hailed as the cornerstone project in Louisiana’s fight to rebuild its rapidly sinking coastline. 
Gov. Jeff Landry has railed against the plan’s high cost and impact to fisheries, blaming a key Army Corps construction permitting loss on former Gov. John Be Edwards. The pause has prompted increasing uncertainty as to whether the massive coastal restoration plan will continue as originally designed. 
Advocates of the project worry any alternate plans will mean further delays or – worse yet – inactivity that could spell doom for Louisiana’s coast. 
“Now is the time for courage and action,” Simone Maloz, campaign director of Restore the Mississippi River Delta, said during a news conference in concert with the Capitol demonstration. Supporters held aloft signs with phrases promoting sediment diversions printed boldly across pictures of Louisiana’s coast as speakers took turns at the lectern to speak about the uncertain project. 
“Honor the legacy of our coastal program and recommit to the bold vision our coast demands, including resuming construction on the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion,” Maloz added. 
“The river built the land, now we must let it help us heal it,” the Rev. Ernest Dison Sr., pastor at a church in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans, said during the rally. His neighborhood went underwater in 2005 when storm surge from Hurricane Katrina exposed design flaws in floodwalls along the Industrial Canal and Mississippi River Gulf Outlet. Decades of wetlands diminishment allowed the storm surge to reach the city largely unabated.      
Dison said his faith and environmental stewardship are closely entwined, and the risk storms pose to his community convinced him to speak out in support of the coastal master plan. 
“We need to protect our communities,” he said. “This Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project gives us hope. We can’t afford to waste that opportunity to be good stewards of what we’ve been given.”   
 
Money problems
The Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority and Louisiana Senate has approved more than $500 million for Mid-Barataria construction to begin despite its status being in limbo. 
Opponents of the large-scale diversion, including those with fisheries interests, have floated the idea of using the money to build smaller sediment diversions. But whether funding can be redistributed that seamlessly is a question with no outright answer. 
Louisiana’s money for coastal restoration comes largely from a trust created with BP oil spill settlement dollars. A cohort of federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, Environmental Protection Agency and Department of the Interior, oversee the funds
Maloz said in an interview she is concerned an alternate plan might not get the same financial approval Mid-Barataria did from the trust overseers. 
“[The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion is] very tied to the damage that happened … that money is intended to mitigate and fix that problem,” she said. “That’s a huge question that is looming on the alternatives … is that the right project to mitigate for those injuries, for that natural resource damage that occurred from the oil spill?
 
Smaller scale diversions
Diversion advocates and scientists maintain smaller diversions aren’t as effective at rebuilding wetlands, still sending fresh water into Barataria Bay but with less benefit. 
Opponents fear the deluge of fresh water from the Mississippi River would alter the salt content of the brackish water, killing shrimp and oyster populations near shore and pushing other marine life away from the coast. 
Ehab Meselhe, a Tulane University professor and scientist who worked on hydrologic modeling for the Mid-Barataria plan, published a number of peer-reviewed studies modeling smaller Mississippi River diversions. They involved moving a fraction of the water Mid-Barataria currently proposes. His findings: Less water meant less wetland growth. 
“It’s not going to move as much sediment, build as much land,” Meselhe said, all while concerns over impacts to oysters and shrimp stick around. “There is no doubt… you will have the impacts, and definitely a lot less benefit.” 
Even still, he emphasised the need to find a solution that involves and supports the people who live in the area. 
“There is no silver bullet solution. Every time you touch the system, you will have benefits and you will have impacts,” Meselhe said. “Some strategies are better than others … I think we need to sit at the table and see what are the palatable options that are out there, and these are the ones we need to pursue.”
Anne Milling, founder of post-Katrina advocacy group Women of the Storm, said in an interview that mitigation dollars tied to Mid-Barataria gave the plan actionable ways to support fisheries. 
“Yes, it’s our culture of Louisiana, which I love and adore and respect,” Milling said. “You’ve got to remember that $375 million was set aside in the Mid-Barataria Diversion project to compensate and help the communities relocate from any disturbance from this diversion.”
“We cannot afford to take solutions off the table,” Maloz said, voicing her organization’s support for small-scale diversions in other areas while still standing in support of Mid-Barataria. 
“There was a really extensive process that said, ‘This is the solution that matches the loss in that basin. This is what it needs for that overall long term health,’” she added.
 
Permit drama increases uncertainty
Controversy over a pulled construction permit and a social media fight between Landry and his predecessor, Edwards, have heightened tensions and uncertainty over the Mid-Barataria Sediment Division even further. 
Landry delivered a harsh critique of Mid-Barataria last November, saying the threat it posed to the shrimp and oyster industry would “break” Louisiana culture. His administration then issued a 90-day pause on all work related to the project on April 4, saying the high cost called for a smaller-scale diversion. 
The Army Corps recently revoked a permit for the nearly $3 billion project, citing unreported documents, project uncertainty and lack of support from the current governor’s administration as reasons to reconsider. Landry accused Edwards of purposely hiding a 500-page study from Army Corps officials.  
Edwards countered Landry’s claims, saying accusations of a cover-up are unfounded, and stressed that the report in question didn’t change the science behind the Mid-Barataria plan, The Times-Picayune reported.  
Maloz said she believed the project had everything it needed for approval, wanting more answers from the Army Corps decision. 
“We feel like we went through this really extensive process that had science, that had people, that had communities all in mind to get us to a decision on both the permit and the funding,” she said. “And now it feels like we have been entirely cut out of that process.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8633-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 22:00:08.129496

(Photo courtesy of Gooshdeihéen)The sunlight bounces off the glassy surface of Sitka Sound as community herring fish egg harvesters navigate the waters with boats loaded with hemlock branches for the fish to lay eggs on. Surrounded by the whales, and the sounds of lively seals, sea otters, sea lions and countless seabirds, this annual harvest is a cherished sign of spring for people living in Southeast Alaska. After months of gray skies and cold weather, both people and wildlife eagerly embrace this moment. 
Steve Johnson, recognized by his Łingít name Ixt’Ik’Eesh, is a prominent community leader from Sitka.
“It’s like the first real taste of spring that we get here,” Ixt’Ik’Eesh said excitedly
Of the Kiks.adi Clan of Sitka, Ixt’Ik’Eesh has been harvesting herring fish eggs for most of his life. His earliest recollection of the harvest dates back to his childhood, a memory he cherishes deeply. Ixt’Ik’Eesh recalls being on the skiff with his father and uncle, surrounded by the vast ocean.
“I remember putting my hand in the water, and I could feel the herring as they ran around it, and just the sight and the smell of it and the beauty of the world around us,” recalled Ixt’Ik’Eesh. “It’s an amazing time of the year.”
He now plays a vital role in educating community members on the techniques of harvesting herring eggs. He has successfully trained around 100 participants in the community harvest program he leads. This volunteer-driven program involves coordinating volunteers to collect and distribute the eggs through a Facebook group. Active for two decades, the program has successfully distributed about 17,000 pounds of eggs, benefiting roughly 20,000 people. This initiative not only feeds the community but has also empowered individuals by providing them with the necessary experience and knowledge to launch their own fishing operations.

	“There was a period of time not too long ago where there was just a little over a dozen harvesters left, and that was really scary to me on a number of ways,” explains Ixt’Ik’Eesh.
For Ixt’Ik’Eesh, it is crucial to preserve and pass on the traditional knowledge of herring egg harvesting to ensure it remains a vital part of Łingít culture rather than fading into history.
“This is one of the few practices that we have that have been unbroken by colonization.” says Ixt’Ik’Eesh.
He not only brings valuable experience and oversees a community harvest program, but also holds formal leadership roles for both Sitka and the state of Alaska, serving on various boards and commissions, in addition to being a Council member of the Sitka Tribe of Alaska. Last year, he represented the Sitka Tribe of Alaska at the Alaska Board of Fisheries meeting as a traditional harvester, where he advocated for the protection of Promisla Bay from commercial fishing. He proposed designating the bay as part of the subsistence conservation zone, highlighting its significance as a major producer of herring eggs and a vital harvesting area for locals.
The proposal didn’t pass but that hasn’t stopped Ixt’Ik’Eesh, and his work doesn’t go unnoticed. In a nomination form for the Joint Board of Fisheries/Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission Herring Revitalization Committee, which is a combined board of the Alaska Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission and the Alaska Board of Fisheries to herring across the state. Ixt’Ik’Eesh has been recognized as the number one producer of subsistence herring egg harvesting.
The nomination highlighted his work providing herring eggs to over 10,000 households through the implementation and 20 years of distribution of tribal food security initiatives. Additionally, it recognized his extensive experience, exceeding 25 years, in both subsistence and commercial fishing.
Ixt’Ik’Eesh shared that he is guided by the Kiks.adi Clan principle of sharing. It serves as a powerful reminder of generosity.
“We measure people, and particularly leaders, not by what they have or what they show but by what they give away,” says Ixt’Ik’Eesh. “And so for me, that’s a big part of my upbringing, of my core values, and that whenever we have an abundance of something, we share it.”
This philosophy is reflected in the numbers. According to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, in 2023, “93% of the harvest was shared with other households within Sitka or in other communities in the state and beyond.” This level of sharing underscores ancestral traditions that prioritize community health and connection.
Despite the unsuccessful Promisla Bay proposal and complexities of colonial management systems, Ixt’Ik’Eesh will always be found on his traditional homelands and ocean. This bond is rooted in a deep cultural understanding of his place and calling. Engaging in the labor of harvesting for community members and individuals who are unable to access the eggs is a task that is both physically and mentally demanding. However, Ixt’Ik’Eesh finds joy in this work, as it allows him to contribute to the well-being of his people while honoring traditional practices. The Facebook group plays a crucial role in this dynamic, serving not only as a means of communication and organizing but also as a place to share memories.

	“I really like it when people send pictures and when they post pictures of their family meals and their gatherings and people enjoying them and knowing that myself and my friends and volunteers all had a very strong hand in producing that food that’s on their table that they’re enjoying.” says Ixt’Ik’Eesh.
Capturing Community
One of the volunteers aboard Ixt’Ik’Eesh’s boat this season was Mary Goddard, a Łingít filmmaker and artist. She experienced the herring egg harvest in Yakutat as a young girl and remembers her and her mother running to the beach to witness the herring spawn. They’d return the next day to check if the eggs were ready to eat. She recalls pulling seaweed from the ocean, each strand covered in herring eggs. Originally from Yakutat, a Southeast Alaska community about 230 miles from Sitka, Goddard hadn’t experienced the large harvest that Sitka is known for but still felt the same excitement.

	“It was fun to be able to just walk down from our house to the beach and grab those herring eggs and eat them for dinner that night,” says Goddard. Her first career path was in acting, which took Goddard across the country to New York City, where she attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. But along the way, she fell in love with filmmaking. After spending 15 years in the industry, she returned to Alaska.
That leap of faith led her to found her own production company, MidnightRun LLC. After moving to Sitka, she came to see the harvest as a community celebration to welcome spring. Due to her curiosity as a filmmaker, Goddard herself began harvesting.
Aboard a boat in the ocean loaded with about 30 hemlock trees, Goddard was nervous yet excited because of her role in the harvesting process.
“My role this year was really fun, because I gotta do it from start to finish,” says Goddard.
The process begins by determining the spawning locations and timing for herring, which, according to Goddard, happen during the spring season when dollar-sized snowflakes are falling from the sky. Following this, the volunteer crew prepares by searching for medium-sized hemlock trees that have fresh needles, as these provide a desirable flavor for the herring eggs. Once enough branches are collected, they are placed in the water, secured with weights and buoys. The next step involves checking the branches one or two days later, with the hope that the herring will have laid their eggs on the gathered branches.
“Then a couple of days later, you’ll come back and pull up those trees and if it’s a good harvest, they’re rich and thick, full of herring eggs,” says Goddard.
Harvesting has evolved into more than just a filming opportunity; it has become a chance for Goddard to share this tradition with her son. This season, she took her 9-year-old out on a Saturday to scout for trees in preparation for the harvest. By bringing her community on screen, Goddard also returned home to connect younger generations with their elders, utilizing filmmaking as a tool to generate enthusiasm for traditional practices.
“Being able to teach the youth in a way that maybe they’re already engaged with is one way to ensure that the youth will continue to practice our harvesting ways,” says Goddard.
Ultimately, Goddard wants her son to appreciate the effort involved in harvesting from the land and recognize the value of natural resources like herring eggs. She emphasizes that it is far easier to waste food purchased from a grocery store than to invest the time and energy required to gather and prepare food sourced directly from the earth or sea. Additionally, she highlights the deep connection that Indigenous peoples have with the animals they rely on, underscoring the importance of respect and stewardship in their relationship with nature.

	“I want him to be able to respectfully harvest, respectfully take care of his body through healthy food that he knows where it came from,” Goddard said.
“I want him to really care for himself by eating really healthy food, and being connected to community and gratitude, and all these amazing things that subsistence living teaches you,” Goddard continued.
Family tradition
Like Goddard, for Ricardo Worl, known by his Łingít name Gooshdeihéen, this is a family tradition, something he has looked forward to since childhood. Although he was too young to be on the ocean, he was able to contribute to the harvesting process in other meaningful ways. Gooshdeihéen remembers packaging the eggs collected by his uncles in Sitka, often handling boxes that weighed as much as 50 pounds. Surrounded by family, he participated in the enduring tradition of utilizing and processing the resources provided by the land.
“I just remember me and my cousins receiving that box excitedly, and vacuum sealing it, sharing it out,” reflects Gooshdeihéen.
As a community harvester, he can now be found alongside his uncles in the ocean each spring. As a nephew, he is expected to learn from their experience. His responsibilities extend beyond merely acquiring knowledge; he is also tasked with engaging in physically demanding work.
“My role was to cut down all the trees, bring them from out of the woods, down to the boat so they could put the trees and branches into the water,” Gooshdeihéen said. “And after the herring had spawned on the trees, my job was to pull the trees up to the boat so we could clip the branches off and pull them in.”
Gooshdeihéen didn’t formally participate in the harvest until after completing his undergraduate education at Whitworth University in Spokane, Washington, in 2021. After Gooshdeihéen returned home to Juneau he enrolled in the Haa Yoo X’atángi Deiyí: Our Language Pathway Project to learn his Łingít language. In the program, Gooshdeihéen expressed that he was interested in reconnecting his language with subsistence practices.

	“I found that becoming a language scholar has made me a better fisherman and being a better fisherman has made me a better language learner,” says Gooshdeihéen.
He believes that both elements of the language and ways of living are inherently intertwined, and says he now has a greater appreciation when learning about his heritage.
Although Haa Yoo X’atángi Deiyí ended in 2023, Gooshdeihéen continues his linguistic journey to translate the Łingít language, aiming to contribute to the development of educational curricula. He shares that he is not only grateful for past language speakers but that his community is “lucky that our aunties, uncles, and grandparents documented a lot of our language, so there’s a lot to be translated. ”
Gooshdeihéen is one of the 22,601 individuals of Łingít descent, according to the latest Census data. The Łingít people are the largest group of Alaska Natives with a rich cultural heritage and historical presence in Alaska. According to the Alaska Native Language Center there are about 500 speakers of the Łingít language. 
“I’d love to do translation and curriculum development to create some curriculum and language learning resources for future generations,” says Gooshdeihéen.
Gooshdeihéen’s goal and data figures highlight the ongoing efforts to preserve and revitalize the language, which is an integral part of the Łingít identity. 
In the meantime, he is enrolled in language classes at the University of Alaska Southeast and coaches the Yadaa.at Kalé ski team, and the cross-country, and track teams at Juneau-Douglas High School. When he isn’t focused on language studies, skiing, or retrieving heavy tree branches from the ocean, Gooshdeihéen enjoys preparing herring eggs by blanching them on the branches, then picking them off and dipping them in seal grease. He has also been experimenting with new methods to enjoy this traditional delicacy.
“But recently, I have been trying new recipes with the row on kelp, where I sort of marinate it like you would kimchi,” says Gooshdeihéen.
Beyond trying new recipes and learning traditional ways of living, Gooshdeihéen is part of a larger network of Indigenous people who are living the traditional ways of their ancestors. Belonging to the Kaagwaantaan clan, Gooshdeihéen shares that having the opportunity to harvest herring eggs with his uncles not only reinforces his connection to the land but also the connection to his clans and community. He explained that when he is out on the ocean, he is amazed that he can “connect with the lands that my ancestors stewarded and do the things that they’ve been doing since time immemorial.” 
“I’m doing the same thing in 2025 that my ancestors were similarly doing 10, 15,000 years ago,” Gooshdeihéen continued.
A 2019 study by the University of Alaska Southeast confirms this. 
“In northwestern North America, the archaeological record of faunal remains shows that herring were fished for more than 10,000 years and were routinely taken by at least 4,000 BP (Before Present),” the university announcement of the study said.
He is dedicated to continuing his ancestral traditions in other ways as well.
“I made sure I shared a box with my grandparent’s people, the T’akhdeintaan out of Hoonah, and it’s really rewarding, and it feels good to reinforce these clan connections that have been also maintained since time immemorial,” says Gooshdeihéen.
The lessons he learned in childhood remain meaningful as he continues to pack eggs into boxes for his community. 
Historical Athabascan and Tlingit trade routes
One of the special boxes was sent to Val Adams, a Gwich’in and Koyukon Athabascan from Beaver, who lives in Fairbanks, Alaska. Her friend, Sara Beaber-Fujioka, whom she knows through church, sent the box from Sitka. Beaber-Fujioka’s late husband was a fisherman who also harvested herring eggs and through his knowledge and relationship with Alaska Native traditions, also packaged and sent similar boxes. 
“Harvesting and sharing food was central to his life, and so we had been harvesting and sharing herring eggs as this amazing abundance that we have in Sitka,” says Beaber-Fujioka.
After her late husband’s passing, Beaber-Fujioka and her daughters decided to carry on the legacy. She says that being able to share this abundance with people she knows will carry forward the joy of giving, especially among elders, is Beaber-Fujioka’s way of giving back to the community.
Adams chose to share the mail by distributing the eggs among the elders in the Denakkanaaga program, a nonprofit organization that provides cultural programming for elders living in the Interior.
“It’s our traditional way,” says Adams. “It’s our custom to share, especially delicacies such as this.”

	Sharon McConnell, the executive director of Denakkanaaga, emphasizes that this generosity illustrates the historical trade relationships that existed before Western contact. As noted by Sealaska Heritage, Łingít people have always historically traded amongst themselves and neighboring communities for goods that couldn’t be found in the region. Łingít’s offered, “greenstone for tools, clams, mussels, red and yellow cedar, dried halibut and salmon, seal oil, herring eggs, seal meat, hooligan oil, and berries.” 
“Through the decades we’ve traded with other tribes throughout the state of Alaska, and the bonds have been made between Native people in different regions of Alaska, and one is between Southeast Alaska and Interior Alaska.” says McConnell.
While the box of herring eggs didn’t cross the vast landscape through the rivers, mountains, and lakes on a trade route, the eggs were still enjoyed by the elders. McConnell shared that everyone loved it as the elders enjoyed the eggs to their liking, such as eating them raw or blanching the eggs before eating. 
“For those in Southeast to share it with us, it’s very meaningful and very appreciated,” reflects McConnell.

	The 2025 herring egg harvest in April serves as a reminder of how traditional values continue to foster unity among diverse communities of Alaska. This annual harvest, deeply rooted in Indigenous practices, reflects a respect for nature and a commitment to sharing resources. As the herring spawned, various clans, each with their own histories, came together to participate. 
Goddard shares that the act of gathering isn’t only a means of food security but also reinforces the community aspect of this practice.
“I don’t think we were meant to do it on our own, or especially in our cultures, we weren’t meant to do it on our own,” Goddard said. “We’re meant to rely on each other, and I think that is something like the herring egg harvest really represents.”

The clergy, who represented a variety of faith denominations, spoke to a crowd of people carrying signs and chanting “Shame on Avelo!” 
Josh Williams, the pastor of the Elm City Vineyard Church in New Haven, asked how many members of the crowd had flown on a flight chartered by Avelo. A number of hands shot up. Williams said he had flown on the airline as well.
“ I’ll tell you why I did … it was cheap, easy and convenient,” said Williams. “And it turns out that things that are cheap, easy, and convenient aren’t always good or right.” 
This is not the first protest at Tweed Airport against Avelo Airlines. Early last month, about 50 people gathered outside of Tweed to protest the company’s decision to contract with the state Department of Homeland Security to charter deportation flights.

A second protest took place at Tweed on April 17, where U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., called on Avelo to “do the right thing” and break their contract with the federal government. An online petition calling for the boycott of Avelo has nearly 37,800 signatures. 
Bishop John Selders of Amistad United Church of Christ in Hartford decried that the deportations were taking place without “due process of law.” 
“ When systems fail, we have the moral right and the faith-filled obligation to raise our righteous voice and bear witness,” said Selders. “ We must bear witness in response to the moral and spiritual depravity decisions that promote money and profits over people and humanity.”  
Courtney Goff, communications manager for Avelo, told The Connecticut Mirror in an email that their major priority regarding Monday’s protest was to ensure that everyone was safe. 
“While we recognize the right of individuals to peacefully assemble, Avelo’s main priority will continue to be maintaining the safety and timeliness of our operation,” Goff wrote.  
Faith leaders who were present Monday repeatedly quoted portions of the Bible that referenced the duty to welcome strangers who enter into a foreign land, and to love one’s neighbor. 
“Scripture doesn’t speak specifically to AI or tariff policy between nations, but it does say really clearly how we are to treat immigrants. It says in the Book of Leviticus that you are to treat the immigrant as yourself because you know what it’s like to be a stranger,” Jamie Michaels, senior pastor at the First and Summerfield United Methodist Church in New Haven, told CT Mirror. 
Helena Martin, a Ph.D student at Yale who is also an Episcopal priest, said she felt it was important to show people the truth about what it meant to be Christian. 
“ It is being a faithful Christian to advocate for due process and for caring for our neighbor. Being a Christian has nothing to do with separating families and deporting people without caring about who they are,” she told CT Mirror.

Rabbi Herbert Brockman of Congregation Mishkan Israel in Hamden recalled the pride he felt as the child of immigrants reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. He said his parents experienced poverty and violence before coming to the U.S., and he emphasized how the end of the pledge was a commitment to justice that could be connected back to the prophets of the Old Testament.  
Margarita, an immigrant from Ecuador who did not give her last name, also spoke at the rally. She told the crowd through an interpreter that her husband had gone for a routine immigration check in Hartford two months ago, and had been detained. Four days ago, he was deported to Ecuador. 
Margarita asked for help so that she and her 9-year-old son could return to Ecuador as well. The organization Unidad Latina in Accion has set up a GoFundMe page to help raise money for their return.   
Margarita told CT Mirror in Spanish that she and her husband had come to the U.S. so that their son could receive an education and a better life. But she currently has no job, she said, and she and her son have had to stay in a church. She said her son enjoys school.  
“He doesn’t want to leave, but he says ‘I miss my dad,’” she said. 
Avelo’s contract with DHS has also prompted state officials to take action. In April, the legislature’s Judiciary Committee voted to expand a bill regulating the ways that state and local police can or cannot cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Under the provision, companies would be added to the list of entities that are able to be prohibited from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.
The new language in the bill would require that “any principal or key personnel of the person, firm or corporation” that decides to apply for a contract with a state agency “will not cooperate with any federal immigration authority or engage in any contract for purposes of the detention, holding or transportation of an individual” protected under the state’s Trust Act.
If the company refuses, the state would be directed to award the contract instead “to the next highest ranked proposer or the next lowest responsible qualified bidder” or to seek new bids. 
During the Judiciary Committee meeting in April, Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, co-chair of the committee, noted that Avelo does not pay Connecticut’s state aviation fuel tax.

On April 8, Attorney General William Tong sent a letter to Avelo Airlines CEO Andrew Levy asking questions about the company’s policies for deportation flights and expressing “deep disappointment” at the company’s decision to contract with the Department of Homeland Security.
Levy responded a week later, saying that there seemed to be a “fundamental misunderstanding how the federal government contracts the flights that are the subject of your [Tong’s] letter.” He suggested that Tong submit a Freedom of Information Act to obtain the contract between Avelo Airlines and the Department of Homeland Security.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0512_SR_AveloRally277-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 21:01:01.435928

As legal rulings block the Legislature’s ban on abortion and allow lawsuits against Freedom Caucus initiatives to proceed, the caucus has called for reforming the courts.
The post Citing court losses, Freedom Caucus turns attention to Wyoming judges appeared first on WyoFile .","Like President Donald Trump’s efforts to detain immigrants in an El Salvadoran prison and slash the federal government through executive orders, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus’s agenda has hit roadblocks in the courts.  
And like the president, the caucus is targeting the court system in response. 
Trump has responded to adverse rulings by calling for federal judges to be impeached. His allies in Congress — including Wyoming’s delegation — then introduced bills to curtail the judicial branch’s power.
Following suit, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus is taking aim at Wyoming’s appointment process for state court judges. In a pair of recent blog posts, the caucus argued that recent court decisions it disagrees with are the result of a biased system, dominated by “insiders” with a political agenda. 
“For far too long, the judicial branch has been seen as untouchable, outside the realm of criticism,” an April 30 post to the group’s substack read. The posts are not signed by a particular author. 
“As our founders knew well, all human institutions are capable of corruption,” the post continued. “It’s time for judicial reform in Wyoming in a way that gives the people a stake in our bench.”
The Freedom Caucus opened its offensive on the judiciary at a time when Wyoming’s courts are weighing momentous cases — with perhaps the most politically significant one being abortion access. The caucus’s call to reform the courts comes as the state waits for a Wyoming Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of abortion bans the Legislature passed in 2023.

A Teton County judge last year ruled the ban conflicted with a provision of the Wyoming Constitution and halted its implementation. And last month, a Natrona County judge suspended two new laws passed by the Legislature in 2025 — one that sought to require women get ultrasounds before taking abortion pills and another that placed new regulations on Wyoming’s only abortion clinic that opponents said would force the facility’s closure.
The Freedom Caucus cited those abortion rulings, as well as others that haven’t gone in their favor in both state and federal courts, as evidence the judicial system has become somehow corrupted. 
“A lack of public buy-in to the judicial selection process has left Wyomingites feeling confused, upset, and blindsided by the decisions reached by many on the bench,” the caucus wrote.
Critics say the group is trying to remove checks on its political and ideological agenda. 
“This boils down to them not appreciating the Wyoming Constitution, and at times, the U.S. Constitution,” Rep. Karlee Provenza, D-Laramie, said. “If you don’t appreciate what the Constitution says and how it’s interpreted, then your goal becomes to change the court.”

Sweetwater County Republican lawmaker Cody Wylie also questioned the Freedom Caucus’s increasing invocation of “liberal courts” at the state level. 
“Maybe — just maybe — the problem is the bills themselves,” he wrote in a letter to the editor published by various Wyoming news outlets. “When legislation is unconstitutional or doesn’t fit within Wyoming law, it doesn’t stand. The solution: Do the work. Make sure the bill fits Wyoming laws.” 
Exactly what judicial reform the group might pursue remains up in the air. Last legislative session, the Freedom Caucus members who lead the Wyoming House held back a bill that would have placed a constitutional amendment on the ballot to make judges elected officials — a dramatic measure that would mark a sea change for Wyoming’s court system and politics.
Elections and appointments
The Freedom Caucus does not appear aligned behind the idea of elections for judges, though two leaders of the group told WyoFile they were open to whatever the legislative process brings about. Both House Appropriations Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, and Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody, the current Wyoming Freedom Caucus chairwoman, support the state adopting the federal government’s model — where the president is largely free to pick the judges he wants, provided the U.S. Senate ratifies them. 
Presidents tend to pick federal judges who align with their political party. Trump appointed three U.S. Supreme Court justices in his first term — with Republicans in control of the Senate — and significantly altered the composition of the nation’s highest court. 
Wyoming operates under what is commonly called the Missouri Plan, where a commission reviews applicants and sends a limited set of choices to the governor for a final pick. The Missouri Plan’s advocates say appointment commissions take partisan politics out of judicial selections and ground the decisions in legal expertise and temperament. 
In Wyoming, the Judicial Nominating Commission is composed of six people appointed by the governor — three lawyers and three people from outside the bar. The seventh member, who serves as chairperson and tie breaker, is the chief justice of the Wyoming Supreme Court — a post now held by Kate Fox. 
But the Freedom Caucus claims both the Wyoming Bar Association and commission are “a victim of left-wing institutional capture,” as the caucus wrote in its blog posts.
Two members of the commission, one a lawyer and one not, told WyoFile they were surprised by the Freedom Caucus’s allegations. “Our process is apolitical, merit-based and it digs deep on candidates,” Sheridan attorney Clint Langer said. 
Describing himself as having “serious Republican roots,” Langer disputed the Freedom Caucus’s depiction of the commission as a left-wing political apparatus. 
“You would have to get lawyers and citizens appointed by a Republican Governor all agreeing to infuse left-leaning politics into the system,” he said. He does not know the political affiliation of his fellow commission members, he said. Nor does Richard Fagnant, a longtime Lander accountant who is one of the non-lawyer members of the commission. 
Fagnant, who was appointed by Republican Gov. Mark Gordon, told WyoFile he is semi-retired and spends large chunks of his time reviewing judicial candidates — about two hours per applicant, he said. 
On Monday, the commission met to consider an open seat in Goshen County. Fagnant said there were 12 applicants, and the board would interview perhaps five or six candidates before sending three choices to the governor. 
Fagnant feared the Freedom Caucus would politicize the judicial nominating process in exactly the way members say they’re seeking to stop — particularly if lawmakers pursue judicial elections. Campaign war chests and the political red meat issue of the day would sway elections, he said.

“You’re looking at who has the biggest bankroll, who is the best baby kisser, and who is going to stand out in the public eye based on issues that may not be related to judicial temperament,” he said. 
Bear said he too had questions about judicial elections. But if the governor had wider latitude to make choices, then voters could hold the chief executive accountable when judges start to drift from the will of the people. 
“There’s just no real reason to restrict the executive, whether it’s this executive or a future executive who might be more conservative,” Bear said. 
Those skeptical of the caucus’s interest in judicial reform are “the very same elites and bar officials who have long enjoyed unchecked control over judicial selection in Wyoming,” Rodriguez-Williams wrote to WyoFile in an email. “They’re not defending the people’s right to fair courts—they’re defending their own influence.”
Despite the Wyoming Freedom Caucus’s statements that trust in the state’s judiciary is at a low, more residents approve of how the state’s judges handle their jobs than disapprove, according to the Wyoming Survey and Analysis Center. In polling conducted last September and October, only 13% of respondents told the center they disapproved of how judges handle their jobs, while more than 40% of respondents said they approved. 
Meanwhile, national polls conducted after the first 100 days of Trump’s second term suggest that people want to see the different branches of government check each other, and indicate a majority of voters oppose the president ignoring court orders. 
Bias or lawmaking? 
To support the caucus’s allegations that the state’s legal institutions are permeated by left-wing politics, Rodriguez-Williams pointed to recent selections by the judicial nominating commission for the state supreme court. In recent cycles the commission has put forward former Republican lawmaker Tim Stubson and former state bar president Anna Reeves Olson as candidates for recent seats. 
Stubson has remained politically active since leaving office, and has opposed the Freedom Caucus’s rise in past election cycles. Gordon did not select him for the open state supreme court seat. Reeves-Olson was among 41 attorneys who signed a letter in 2022 criticizing U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman for promoting the false idea that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump. The lawyers who signed the letter said Hageman was violating her obligation to uphold respect for the law by continuing to claim the election was stolen after a number of federal judges found no evidence of tampering. 
Rodriguez-Williams wrote that Reeves Olson had denounced Hageman “simply for expressing conservative political views that diverged from the Bar establishment.”
The state bar chose not to open a disciplinary investigation into Hageman, though an attorney filed a report against her, WyoFile previously reported.
If Reeves Olson fell afoul of the state’s right-wing conservatives in that instance, the Freedom Caucus’s blog post itself shows that the judges and lawyers can cut both ways.  
In its posts, the caucus listed three active lawsuits in which it argues Wyoming courts are letting “free speech [come] under attack.” One example is a defamation lawsuit against a Freedom Caucus political action committee for mailers sent during the last election. Another is the lawsuit a former Campbell County librarian brought against people she says ousted her from her job for refusing to remove certain library books. One of the defendants in that case is Bear’s wife, Sage Bear. 
And the third case is a lawsuit Artemis Langford, a transgender University of Wyoming student, brought against two conservative lawyers who sought to have her removed from her sorority.
After a federal judge dismissed the case seeking to toss her from the sorority, Langford sued the lawyers who brought it, claiming wrongdoing and judicial persecution.
The conservative attorneys are represented in court by Reeves Olson.
Reeves Olson did not respond to a WyoFile request for comment Monday.

Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, at Salt Lake Central Station in Salt Lake City on Monday, April 7, 2025. (McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)As Utah looks to double power production in the next 10 years, state leaders view geothermal energy as an untapped resource. But, officials say federal regulations are stunting the industry and hope Congress will peel back some of the red tape. 
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, which is under the House Committee on Natural Resources, held a hearing in Cedar City to discuss the barriers to geothermal production on federal land. 
“For far too long the promise of geothermal energy has been underappreciated and underutilized in our national energy conversation. Despite its incredible potential, geothermal faces regulatory delays, permitting hurdles and a lack of investment that doesn’t match the scale of opportunity,” said Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy during her opening remarks Monday. 
In 2023, geothermal power plants located in seven states produced about 17 kilowatt hours of electricity, which is about 0.4% of all utility-scale electricity generation in the U.S., according to a congressional memo. Most of those sites are in the West or Hawaii — California produces more overall geothermal power than any other state, while Nevada generates the highest percentage of electricity from geothermal. 
Despite recent advances in Utah, the Beehive State is lacking compared to California and Nevada. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Utah generates about 3.2% of total geothermal energy production in the U.S. — California is at about 66%, and Nevada at 26%. And about 1.5% of Utah’s power comes from geothermal, compared to 10% in Nevada, and 5% in California.  
Speaking during the hearing on Monday, deputy director of the Utah Office of Energy Development Jake Garfield laid out the state’s recommendations to Congress and the federal government. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
First, he said, the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, should offer more land for companies to lease. In the last five years, Garfield said the agency has put up more than 160,000 acres of land in Utah to lease for geothermal — during that same timeframe, the BLM office in Nevada put up more than 700,000 acres. 
“If it can be done in Nevada, it can certainly be done here,” Garfield said. 
The BLM should also focus on what Garfield called “broad scale, programmatic planning” for geothermal energy in the West, looking at where production is most feasible and where it should be prioritized. 
“Just last year the Biden administration did a similar planning effort for solar power, and if it can be done for solar it can be done for geothermal energy, particularly because geothermal energy has far fewer impacts on the landscape,” Garfield said. 
And, streamlining energy production can’t happen if the federal government does not also streamline construction of transmission lines, a unique challenge for geothermal facilities. Transmission lines need to be built to the source of energy, and doing so is a process burdened by federal regulations, Garfield said. 
“We’re seeing the initial construction of a long transmission line from new energy sites in Wyoming down to southern Nevada,” he told the committee. “So far that’s taken 16 years to permit, and construction still won’t be done for another five years. If we see delays like that for transmission, we’ll never see the full buildout of Utah’s geothermal potential.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lastly, the permitting process for geothermal energy production itself needs to be shortened, Garfield said, calling out the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, a 1970 law that requires the federal government to conduct an environmental review before moving forward with infrastructure projects.   
Garfield said offering geothermal projects certain exemptions under NEPA would help the industry — like what’s being proposed by Maloy through her Geothermal Energy Opportunity Act, which requires the U.S. Department of Interior to process a geothermal drilling permit within 60 days. 
Maloy is also sponsoring the Streamlining Thermal Energy through Advanced Mechanisms Act, which gives the geothermal industry the same flexibility as the oil and gas industry, cutting some of the regulations when pursuing a project on public land that’s already been studied or disturbed by industry.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duffy-train-ride-18-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 21:01:01.435928

Kim Reynolds' desk May 12, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa House lawmakers sent legislation to implement restrictions on pharmacy benefit managers to Gov. Kim Reynolds Monday, a bill supporters said will help keep rural pharmacies in business — but that opponents said could lead to higher insurance and drug costs for Iowans.
Pharmacists celebrated from the gallery as the House voted 75-15 Monday on Senate File 383, the legislation setting some restrictions and regulations on pharmacy benefit managers. PBMs are the entities that negotiate prescription drug prices between manufacturers, health insurance companies and pharmacies.
The bill sets new restrictions on certain PBM practices that supporters of the measure argue are major factors contributing to the closure of local and rural pharmacies in the states. It creates multiple restrictions on PBMs’ use of strategies that favor a specific pharmacy to fill a prescription, like different cost-sharing rates or fees, or other financial penalties or incentives.
The legislation would also require pharmacies to be reimbursed at the average state or national acquisition cost of a drug.
Rep. Brett Barker, R-Nevada, said the bill was needed to combat practices by PBMs, which he said have manipulated the U.S. health care system and “stacked the deck against consumers, pharmacies, employers and taxpayers.”
“These monopolistic companies have become three of the most powerful corporations in the world from profiting off an opaque and complex system at the expense of everyone else in supply chain,” Barker said. “These abusive, anti-competitive practices have created an epidemic of pharmacy closures and rising prescription drug prices nationwide. … Community pharmacists want to care for their communities, and it’s time that they get an even playing field to do just that.”
Pharmacists and advocates have spoken out in favor of the bill, saying that current PBM practices favoring mail-order prescription refills and pharmacy chains have played a major role in the closure of more than 200 pharmacies across the state, including 31 pharmacies in 2024. The measure was amended by the Senate to make some definition changes for how drug rebates received by PBMs would be passed through to health insurance companies to lower coverage costs, but Democratic Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott said the amendment could lead to higher health insurance costs for Iowans.
Some business leaders share these concerns, citing the Legislative Services Agency analysis that found the bill could result in higher costs and copays for the state’s health insurance program. According to a news release Iowa Association of Business and Industry (ABI) from earlier in May, the bill could result in an additional $340 million in costs for private-sector health insurance plans and raised costs of approximately $169 per insured Iowan annually.
Leaders representing business organizations like ABI, the Iowa Business Council and Iowa chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business released a statement urging lawmakers to make further changes to the legislation that will ensure health coverage costs do not rise for Iowans.
“ABI members and Iowa businesses support policies that improves access to care. But this legislation simply shifts hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs to employers and working families,” Nicole Crain, ABI president said in the news release.
Rep. Jeff Cooling, D-Cedar Rapids, introduced an amendment that he said would limit prescription drug cost increases for Iowans, but the proposal failed. He said he believed the portion of the bill setting a dispensing reimbursement fee of $10.68 from PBMs to pharmacists for each prescription would be a cost put on Iowans filling their prescriptions.
Cooling said the bill allows the insurance or employer group to decide whether to cover the dispensing fee.
“As a representative in this state, I can’t imagine an employer that is going to say, ‘yes, that’s okay insurance company, raise my rates, I’ll cover that,'” Cooling said. “What to me seems far more likely is (saying), ‘no pass that on.’ So I believe a vote for this is a vote to raise prescription costs per fill by $10.68 if someone fills them at an independent pharmacy.”
He also said this provision will likely further incentivize Iowans to fill their prescriptions at larger pharmacies and increase financial pressures on independent and rural pharmacies, as people filling their prescriptions at larger, chain companies which do not receive the $10.68 dispensing fee.
“That’s fine, but when folks figure out that they can go to a larger pharmacy and not have to pay that $10.68 at the counter, where do you think they’re going to go to save money?” Coolin said. “That’s what I think will happen. I think even with the best of intentions with this bill, that it will not fix the problem that we all want to fix.”
But the Iowa Pharmacy Association, a major supporter of the bill, released a statement urging the legislation, as passed by the Senate, to go to the governor’s desk. In a news release, the organization stated other states have implemented similar PBM regulations and have not seen health insurance premiums increase.
Wes Pilkington, the president-elect of the Iowa Pharmacy Association Board of Trustees and owner of Evans Crossing Pharmacy, said in a statement that further changes to the bill “are only designed to protect the massive profits of Big Insurance and the PBMs they own.”
“Big Insurance makes huge profits on the current system which leads to pharmacy closures and harm to Iowa’s patients,” Pilkington said. “This legislation is designed to help Iowa pharmacies, NOT protect Fortune 10 insurance companies.”
Barker dismissed the criticisms of the bill as misinformation.
“Despite mistruths many you have heard in this room tonight, dark money, astroturf campaigns and fear mongering, we have a really good bill in front of us that will move the needle to protect vital health care infrastructure in our state,” Barker said. “… By sending this bill to the governor, Iowa will take a huge step to catch back up with states across the country who have taken a leading role in reforming a broken system by reining in abusive PBM practices.”
Kate Gainer, CEO of the Iowa Pharmacy Association, celebrated the bill’s passage in a statement Monday.
“This bill is a critical step toward protecting Iowa’s local pharmacies and ensuring accountability for PBMs, whose practices have forced Iowa pharmacies to shutter their doors and countless Iowans to lose healthcare access,” Gainer said. “With states nationwide enacting similar reforms, we’re grateful the House and Senate have paved the way for Governor Reynolds to sign this bill and safeguard Iowa’s pharmacies and the patients they serve.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pbms.house_.5.12-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 20:02:40.579741

The settlement was announced Jan. 8 by Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, who said the hedge funds had agreed to pay $227.5 million to Kentucky’s pension programs for public employees.

But in a four-page order, Wingate said, “The Court is left without a sufficient reason as to why the Court’s approval is necessary for this settlement or why this Court is being asked to make findings that the Court is without sufficient knowledge to make.”
Wingate wrote that he “welcomes the parties to settle the matter as they best see fit, however, the Court declines to bless an agreement and enter an order that asks the Court to make findings that the Court believes to be outside of its role.”
While the order leaves open the door to further settlement talks, it is a setback for Coleman, the hedge funds and the other parties who had presented a proposed final settlement order to Wingate for his approval. 
Kevin Grout, a spokesman for Coleman’s office, said late Monday, “We’re reviewing the court’s order and discussing with the Kentucky pension board leaders.”
The order appears to be a big win for four Kentucky public employees who filed a separate case against the same hedge funds. That’s because a key part of the proposed settlement order would have required that their case, as well as other related cases, be dismissed.
The employees in that separate case are represented by attorney Michelle Ciccarelli Lerach. A spokesman for Lerach said Lerach is reviewing Wingate’s order and will release a statement later this week.
Wingate’s Friday order also included a directive that will slash the potential amount that could be paid in fees to attorneys who represent Coleman’s office in the case.
The contract between Coleman and those private attorneys led by Ann Oldfather, of Louisville, calls for the fees to be 20% of the first 20% of gross recovery in the case.
The proposed settlement called for hedge funds to turn over $227.5 million, but that total had two parts — $82.5 million in new money plus $145 million held in reserve by Prisma, one of the hedge fund companies that are defendants in the case.

Wingate’s order said the $145 million has belonged to Kentucky’s pension funds all along and is “not to be considered ‘recovered funds’ and/or a portion of the ‘settlement recovery’ for the purpose of determining attorneys’ fees.”
Don Kelly, the attorney representing Blackstone, one of the defendants in the case, emphasized in a statement Monday that Wingate’s order leaves the door open for the parties to settle the case. “The settlement is clearly in the best interests of the Commonwealth and its pensioners and will result in significant assets being paid to the pension plans,” Kelly said. “As stated by the Attorney General and the KPPA (Kentucky Public Pension Authority), who are best positioned to make decisions in the public interest, now is the time to put an end to this long running expensive and distracting litigation.”
From the case’s outset the hedge funds have denied allegations that the investments resulted in high fees, low transparency and massive losses for Kentucky public pension plans. Kelly said in his statement Monday that Blackstone Alternative Asset Management had “delivered a net return of 30 percent on investment.”

A majority of the state Supreme Court, however, opted not to issue an answer on Monday. (Getty Images)As Huntington and Cabell County are attempting to appeal a 2022 federal ruling that found West Virginia’s public nuisance laws insufficient grounds for their lawsuit against three opioid distributors, the state Supreme Court on Monday declined to answer a certified question from the federal appeals court on a crucial aspect of the case.
Last March, the federal Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals asked the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals to decide whether state law recognizes conditions caused by prescription drug sales to be a public nuisance, and if so, what the elements are of such claims.
In an opinion issued Monday written by Justice C. Haley Bunn, the state Supreme Court declined to answer that question due to “disputed factual findings and related legal conclusions resting on those factual findings.” Justice Beth Walker issued a separate opinion concurring with Bunn’s opinion and the court’s decision to remain quiet on the question.
A dissenting opinion was written by Chief Justice Bill Wooton and supported by Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Tera Salango, who is sitting in on temporary assignment. Justices Tim Armstead and Charlie Trump both recused themselves from the case.
In her opinion, Bunn wrote that, since Huntington and Cabell County — as the plaintiffs in the case — were disputing “unsettled facts” used in U.S. District Court Judge David Faber’s 2022 decision in favor of AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, the state court can’t fairly answer the legal question posed by the Fourth Circuit. 
“We would have to assume that some or all of the district court’s disputed findings of fact and related legal conclusions were incorrect to answer any kind of question regarding public nuisance, because if the district court’s challenged findings and related conclusions are correct, this Court need not reach the legal question of whether a public nuisance cause of action exists in these circumstances,” Bunn’s opinion reads.
In their dissenting opinion, however, Wooton argued that the state court could certainly offer an answer to the public nuisance question without taking on all the details and potential outcomes of the federal appeals case.
“In short, nothing in our law compels the conclusion that a certified question must be dispositive of an entire case, which appears to be the majority’s underlying rationale,” Wooton wrote. “Our mandate is to resolve an issue, which is exactly what the Fourth Circuit has asked us to do.”
Wooton called the majority’s reasoning in refusing to issue an answer to the questions “wholly unpersuasive.” 
“[Huntington and Cabell County] are entitled to an answer to the question posed by the Fourth Circuit, and the [drug companies’] argument to the contrary can fairly be deemed cursory at best; it consists of one brief paragraph and a footnote,” Wooton wrote. “Unfortunately, the majority has come to the rescue by making the argument the [drug companies] could have made, but did not.”
Wooton pointed to weaknesses in case law from decisions in other states that were used by the majority to explain its rationale in denying answering the question, saying such cases lacked West Virginia-specific context. He also emphasized how critical the court’s decision could be, and pointed to other similar circumstances where the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals opted to answer a certified question from a higher court when facts for the case were under dispute. 
“In declining to utilize [state law] in order to answer the certified question, this Court could well be viewed as having once again ducked an issue which it has ducked on three previous occasions,” Wooton wrote.
Those “three previous occasions” he cites were cases also centered on opioid distributors where the state supreme court opted not to issue opinions.
“We may never have a better opportunity than the one we are squandering today,” Wooton wrote. “The certified question in this case is one of great importance to our State, which has been ravaged by a flood of epic proportions: a flood of opioids which has, over the course of decades, overtaken the capacity of State, county, and municipal institutions and programs to remediate the damage caused in its wake.”
Huntington and Cabell County alone, he continued, lack the resources necessary to recover from the ongoing drug and overdose epidemic.
But the localities, Wooton wrote, “deserve an answer to their overarching question: is there a light at the end of this tunnel?”
Huntington and Cabell County opted out of a statewide lawsuit against opioid distributors in order to bring their own legal action in hopes of earning more money for remediation efforts. The arguments made in their case against the distributors, however, are nearly identical to those that were made on behalf of the state in its litigation. The state’s case proved successful. 
Since the localities opted out of the statewide case against distributors, they are ineligible to receive most of the funds directly distributed to counties and municipalities from that settlement. The localities can, however, apply for and receive grant funds from the West Virginia First Foundation, the private nonprofit organization responsible for allocating the state’s share of the money.
The localities have argued that the excessive distribution of opioids in their communities caused significant harm, spurring what is now a decades-long and still ongoing drug epidemic. According to the state Office of Drug Control Policy, at least 876 individuals in Cabell County died from overdoses involving opioids between 2015 and 2021, the highest fatal overdose rate for opioids in the state over that time.
Distributors named in the ongoing litigation allege, as they have in opioid cases across the country, that public nuisance laws do not apply when legal products are being distributed.
Cabell County and Huntington are seeking about $2.5 billion from the companies to support recovery efforts in their communities and implement a plan to decrease the impact of the crisis.
Without an answer from the state Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit will likely have to interpret West Virginia’s laws on its own as the localities’ request for an appeal moves forward.

The cost of natural gas infrastructure, generous utility profits, and the region’s continued fossil fuel investments left us ill-equipped to deal with an exceptionally cold winter. 
The post Why is your energy bill so high? Blame natural gas volatility and utility profits   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THIS WINTER, New England residents were battered by persistently high energy bills, especially for natural gas service. In Massachusetts, the state’s energy efficiency program, Mass Save, unfortunately emerged as a convenient scapegoat, despite saving the Commonwealth and ratepayers billions of dollars.  The real culprit for high bills this winter? The cost of natural gas infrastructure, generous utility profits, and the region’s continued fossil fuel investments – which left us ill-equipped to deal with an exceptionally cold winter.  In response to complaints about energy affordability, utilities like Eversource and National Grid have pointed to increased funding of the state’s cost-effective energy efficiency program. This is no small source of irony – Mass Save is a relatively small fraction of bills, but it is the most potent tool available to empower consumers to control their energy costs and protect them from fossil fuel price spikes.  The vast majority of the bill, around 70-75 percent, goes toward natural gas costs – relating to gas supply, distribution, and maintenance – compared to just 15-25 percent going toward energy efficiency. Unlike other energy costs, efficiency is the only investment that is required to pass cost-effectiveness testing. In fact, overall energy system costs would be billions of dollars higher without the cost reductions secured with efficiency. Not nearly enough scrutiny has been given to the investments on which gas utility companies make money. One of the primary ways an investor-owned gas utility makes a profit is by making a return on investment at a specific rate, approved by the state, on capital investments in gas infrastructure projects: the extensive, multi-billion-dollar pipeline network in place under our streets.  In Eversource territory, for example, this healthy rate of return ranges from around 9.5 percent to 9.9 percent. This generous profit structure incentivizes utilities to pursue costly system upgrades and expansions, which are well-compensated, and to add more customers onto the system despite the misalignment with state goals. The more utilities spend on outdated infrastructure, the more money they make, and the national numbers bear this out: Over the last three years, residential electric rates for investor-owned utilities have risen 49 percent more than inflation. Meanwhile, the rates at publicly-owned electric utilities have increased 44 percent less than inflation.   It should also be noted that existing gas customers pay a disproportionate share of the costs for bringing new gas customers online. Since 2018, existing gas customers have footed the bill for 80 percent of all new gas customer connections. And these subsidies – known as line extension allowances – are driving up gas bills for everyone.  In 2023 alone, Massachusetts gas customers were charged $160 million to add new customers to the gas system, to the tune of $9,000 per new customer, which is reflected on ratepayer gas bills. The cost of adding new customers is rising as well. The average cost of adding new customers rose 50 percent between 2020-2021 and again in 2022-2023. In fact, despite an acknowledgement by the state and by utilities that we should be winding the gas system down – not expanding it – the growth of the sprawling pipe network shows no signs of stopping.  According to a recent earnings report from Eversource, for example, the company projects that its gas distribution costs across New England will increase 83 percent between 2023 and 2029, faster than either their electric transmission or distribution subsidiaries. Given the rapid pace of electrification and related system needs, this discrepancy between what utilities have committed to, and what’s actually happening, is noteworthy. A separate analysis commissioned by the Massachusetts attorney general’s office corroborated that a potentially vast and rapid gas system build-out – and associated impacts to ratepayer bills – could occur without state intervention. According to the AG’s analysis, the path we’re currently on could see the state’s gas rate base – the total value of gas system assets on which utilities are allowed to earn a rate of return – jump from $10 to $20 billion in a short span of roughly 10 years. In multiple sectors of the economy, Massachusetts and the rest of the region remain frustratingly over-reliant on natural gas. In 2023, about half of Massachusetts households used natural gas for home heating, and the Commonwealth – as part of ISO-New England’s regional grid – relied on gas for roughly 55 percent of the power produced in 2024.  What this means is that when it gets cold in the winter, costs can shoot up dramatically due to the volatility of natural gas prices. And, as America exports more liquefied natural gas (LNG) abroad, domestic gas prices are increasingly tied to the unpredictability of global gas markets. It was very, very cold this winter; the coldest winter since 2014-2015, in fact. According to data compiled by Acadia Center, the average temperature in December 2024 was a full 10°F colder than December 2023. Further, from December 2024 through February 2025, Massachusetts saw 23 days colder than 20°F, compared to only nine such days the year prior.  These colder temperatures generally mean that residents are using more energy, driving up bills. However, due to the Commonwealth’s overreliance on natural gas and other fossil fuels, it also means higher costs for the supply of energy. For example, the region endured a whopping $4 billion in wholesale electricity market costs this winter, per ISO-New England (a roughly $2 billion increase from last year), making it the costliest winter since 2014-2015.  One small ISO-New England program giving payments to dual-fuel (gas-oil) power plants, the inventoried energy program (IEP), cost almost $80 million over just five days. Can anyone really look at the region’s exposure to such volatile, concentrated costs and conclude that the region should invest less in energy efficiency, rather than more? Other barriers to offshore wind and local clean energy will only increase this unhealthy reliance on natural gas further.  If Massachusetts wants to take steps to lower energy bills in the long-term, we should not shy away from renewables and energy efficiency. Instead, we should embrace those clean resources, take steps to end our overreliance on natural gas and fossil fuels, and reduce business-as-usual utility profits. Kyle Murray is director of state program implementation at Acadia Center, a nonprofit climate advocacy organization.  The post Why is your energy bill so high?

Further feedback on what people want to see in their future feedback is being sought through an online survey, found on the presidential search website.
The board is set to receive further updates on the meetings and online survey at its June 16 meeting. According to the online timeline of proceedings, after the July launch of the search, applications for the role will be due Sept. 1.
A three-person screening committee made up of Kirkwood Community College President Kristie Fisher, North Iowa Area Community College President Steve Schulz and Eastern Iowa Community Colleges Interim Chancellor Liang Chee Wee will review the applications. A search committee will also be selected in September, and after internal interviews with candidates, they will come to campus for interviews in October.
Rob Denson, DMACC’s current and longest-serving president, announced in January he will retire at the end of the calendar year after more than 20 years with the college and more than 40 years in higher education.
While the official search has yet to be launched, Ebbers said he is already receiving news of interested parties.
“I’ve already received nominations, and I’m also in the process of calling people around the country that I know who might be interested,” Ebbers said.

The law doesn't take effect until 2029. (Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)In a few years, with the help of technology, prolific speeders in Washington won’t be able to drive as fast as they want.
Gov. Bob Ferguson on Monday signed House Bill 1596 into law, requiring a new speed-limiting device as a condition to getting a restricted driver’s license after getting it suspended for reckless driving or excessive speeding.
Judges can also require the speed limiters as a condition of pre-trial release or post-conviction probation.
The tech, shown at a demonstration at the Capitol on Monday, is similar to ignition interlock devices that require people with histories of drunk driving to blow into a breathalyzer to show their blood alcohol concentration before they can start the car. 
These new devices use GPS to restrict speed to the posted limit. Under the legislation, drivers could override the limiter three times per month.
The bill received bipartisan support in the Legislature as the state aims to turn the tide on traffic deaths after reaching a 33-year high in 2023. Of the 809 deaths that year, a third involved speeding drivers.
“What’s behind this bill is a really simple goal, which is to save lives,” Ferguson said. 
The new law is known as the BEAM Act, named after four people killed in a crash last year with a speeding driver near Renton: Boyd Buster Brown, Eloise Wilcoxson, Andrea Smith Hudson and Matilda Wilcoxson. 
Last month, a judge sentenced the driver in the case to 17½ years in prison after he pleaded guilty to four counts of vehicular homicide in the high-speed crash.
The driver was held up as an example of someone who would’ve needed to install a speed limiter. In the prior 10 months, he had reportedly been involved in two crashes in which his speeding was a factor.
Before signing the BEAM Act, the governor met with families of those killed in that crash and others who are pushing for stronger traffic safety measures.
“It’s the family members who got us to this day,” said prime sponsor Rep. Mari Leavitt, D-University Place. “They’re the ones who were willing to share their story over and over again.”
In Europe, new vehicles are required to have intelligent speed assistance technology installed.
But in the United States, the speed limiter idea is new.
Last month, Virginia became the first state to enact such legislation, requiring intelligent speed assistance devices for drivers convicted of going over 100 mph. Georgia quickly followed, with a bill awaiting the governor’s signature.
Last year, Washington, D.C. approved a “speed governor” requirement for repeat offenders.
Lawmakers in several other states have also considered the requirement. In California last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a measure requiring passive speed limiters.
Washington’s legislation defines excessive speeding as 20 mph above speed limits over 40 mph, or 10 mph above speed limits under that threshold. 
If a driver has a history of moving violations, including excessive speeding, they would have to use an intelligent speed assistance device for 120 days after getting their license back from a suspension. In reckless driving cases, that rises to 150 days. Driving without one during this probationary period would be a traffic infraction that could add 30 days to a license suspension.
Tampering with the device is a gross misdemeanor. 
Drivers would have to pay to install and remove the speed limiter, and an additional $21 per month. That monthly fee would go to the state Department of Licensing to offset the costs for low-income people who need the devices but can’t afford them.

Nancy Mace spoke at the Greenville County GOP convention at the Greenville Convention Center on Monday April 14, 2025. (Photo by Mark Susko/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)A lawsuit filed Monday by U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace claims one of the men she targeted in a shocking speech on the U.S. House floor of defaming her on social media in the weeks afterward.
The 1st District congresswoman accuses Eric Bowman of “repeatedly and maliciously” damaging her reputation following her hour-long speech in February, for which she’s being sued for defamation by one of the other men she named. Bowman has said more lawsuits are likely, but he meant against her.
All four men, who include Mace’s ex-fiancé, have vehemently denied her accusations that they committed “some of the most heinous crimes against women imaginable.”
Bowman, a Sullivans Island software developer, called the lawsuit filed in Charleston County court “headline theater.”
Mace claims Bowman “acted with reckless disregard to the truth and with actual malice towards Rep. Mace through his utter disregard of and callousness to her rights as a South Carolinian in purposely making such knowingly false declarations,” the lawsuit reads.
The lawsuit cites Bowman’s posts on X, formerly Twitter, between Feb. 27 — 10 days after her speech — and March 17.
In that nearly hour-long speech broadcast live on C-SPAN, Mace accused the men of an array of sexual crimes, including raping and videotaping women without their knowledge.
Mace said she was among the victims. All four men immediately denied her claims.
At the time, the state Law Enforcement Division confirmed it was investigating Mace’s ex-fiancé. A spokeswoman said Monday the agency had nothing new to report as the investigation continues.
No charges have been filed.
Bowman and Mace have blasted each other in social media posts since the speech.
The posts that Mace cites in her lawsuit include Bowman’s allegations that Mace illegally used her position on the House Veterans’ Affair Committee to steer VA contracts to friends and political allies.
“Bowman knew these statements were objectively false when they were made and acted with a reckless disregard for the truth in repeatedly making such statements without support or any attempt to verify the veracity of such statements,” the lawsuit reads.
In addition, it continued, “Bowman has also spent months smearing Rep. Mace’s name and reputation through wide range of vile, contemptible, and repugnant character attacks.”
Responding to the lawsuit, Bowman said his social media activity represents the truth.
“My posts — based on documents, public records, witness testimony, and materials from her own staff— present evidence of hacking, blackmail, misuse of private images, misappropriated tax dollars, and retaliation against rival VA contractors,” he wrote to the SC Daily Gazette in a text.
“Those posts remain publicly available on my X feed (@_ericbowman) for anyone who wants to review them. I acted in good faith and without malice, and I will present this evidence under oath,” he said.
Defamation cases are harder for public figures to prove. Their claims must meet the “actual malice” standard — that whoever they’re suing knew the information was wrong or didn’t care and recklessly spread it.
“I’m confident the First Amendment — and the documented facts — will prevail. Nancy Mace can’t be trusted,” Bowman’s text concluded.
While posts included in the lawsuit stop March 17 — three days after a defamation was filed against her in U.S. District Court in Charleston — Bowman’s posts about her continued.
In an April 9 post that tagged Mace, he wrote, “What if this isn’t just politics or drama? What if we’re witnessing a real mental breakdown — public, painful, and unchecked?”
Mace announced her lawsuit against him on X: “Let this be a warning to all. I didn’t come to play,” she wrote.
The suit against Bowman comes a month after he was arrested on unrelated charges of stalking and harassment.
He said those April 8 charges came from his estranged wife, who he claimed he has not spoken to since November 2023. He denied the allegations and continued to criticize her on X after he got out of jail, calling the accusations “weaponized law enforcement.”
Bowman turned himself in at the jail and was released later the same day.
Mace has yet to respond legally to the lawsuit filed in March by Brian Musgrave of Fort Mill.
The case could test the limits of the “speech or debate” clause of the U.S. Constitution, which shields members of Congress from lawsuits for what is said in either chamber. Musgrave contends her posts after the speech aren’t protected.
Rep. Mace sued by 1 of the men she accused of being a sexual predator

Musgrave’s suit came two weeks after his lawyers, Eric Bland and Ronnie Richter, warned Mace in a letter to either reveal evidence of the allegations, apologize or prepare to be sued.
Mace has never responded directly to the lawsuit, even to reporters. Instead, she’s repeatedly referred questions back to her House speech.
“She has been uncharacteristically quiet (about the lawsuit) for a woman who isn’t afraid to get in front of the microphone,” Bland told the SC Daily Gazette on Monday.
The lawsuits loom as Mace mulls a run for governor. Mace hasn’t officially announced but it’s widely expected that she’s going to be part of a crowded field vying for the GOP nomination.
Gov. Henry McMaster, who’s already the state’s oldest and longest-serving elected governor, can’t seek another term.
Others expected to run include Attorney General Alan Wilson and Lt. Gov. Pam Evette.
Mace has taken jabs at both on social media. U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, as well as state Sens. Josh Kimbrell and Sean Bennett are also considering bids.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nancy-Mace-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 19:07:33.610940

Thousands of tons of nuclear waste from the Manhattan Project were dumped there in the 1970s (Theo Welling/Riverfront Times).A bill expanding the state’s ability to find radioactive contamination in the St. Louis region that dates to World War II development of the atomic bomb is on its way to the governor after unanimously clearing the Missouri House Monday.
The measure, which passed unanimously out of the Senate last week, would authorize the Department of Natural Resources to seek a search warrant to conduct investigations on otherwise off-limits government land. The bill also removes a $150,000 annual cap on how much the state can spend on an investigation and changes the rules governing the fund so that unspent money is not moved to another fund.
Money transferred to the fund could not be used for clean-up of any contamination found in the investigation. The waste was spread by federal contractors and should be cleaned up by federal authorities, state Sen. Nick Schroer, a Defiance Republican, said during last week’s debate.
“Let’s give them the data. Let’s see where that goes,” Schroer said. “And if they’re not willing to clean the mess up, I think we’re going to have a lot of lawsuits on our hands. But I think we’re gonna be back in this building, talking about it and if they’re not going to do it, we need to step up and protect our people.”

While the presence of radioactive contamination in suburban St. Louis was known for years, an investigation by The Independent, MuckRock and The Associated Press revealed in 2023 that the federal government and companies handling the waste were aware of the threat to the public long before informing residents.
Uranium was refined in downtown St. Louis for use in the development of the bomb. After the war, it was trucked to St. Louis County, often falling off of trucks along the way. It was dumped at the airport, susceptible to the wind and rain, and contaminated the adjacent Coldwater Creek.
As suburban neighborhoods sprung up along Coldwater Creek, generations of children and families were exposed to the radioactive waste, elevating residents’ risk of certain cancers.
The waste was sold and moved to a site in Hazelwood, also along Coldwater Creek, so that a company could extract valuable metals. Eventually, the remnant radioactive material was dumped in the West Lake Landfill where it remains today.
“This has been a long time coming,” state Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Ferguson Democrat, said of the radioactive waste investigative fund legislation passed Monday. 
Coldwater Creek is being cleaned up by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers while the Environmental Protection Agency is overseeing the cleanup of the West Lake Landfill.
The EPA announced earlier this year that it expanded the area of the West Lake Landfill that requires remediation by 40 acres after discovering contamination was more widespread than the agency previously thought. The cost of the project is now nearly $400 million, up from $229 million.
State Rep. Doug Clemens, a Democrat from St. Ann, said Monday that his community is ravaged by rare cancers that he attributes to the radioactive contamination left behind by development of the atomic bomb. 
“We played our part in World War II,” he said. “This weapons project left waste behind. That waste is incredibly harmful.”

The law will impose an undue burden on the right to vote and is unconstitutionally vague, the complaint filed by a voting rights group alleges. Secretary of State Chuck Gray disagrees. 
The post Wyoming’s new voter registration law spurs legal fight appeared first on WyoFile .","A Wyoming voting rights group filed a federal lawsuit Friday challenging the constitutionality of the state’s new voter registration requirements. 
Set to go into effect in July, the law requires a person to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote. It represented a key priority of the further-right wing of the Wyoming Legislature and Secretary of State Chuck Gray.
The law, however, will impose an undue burden on the right to vote — particularly for women as well as Hispanic, young and low-income voters — and is unconstitutionally vague as written, according to the complaint filed by Equality State Policy Center in the U.S. District Court for Wyoming. 
“Wyoming has a proud tradition of fair and secure elections, and there is no evidence of non-citizen voting or widespread fraud to justify the harsh new restrictions,” policy center Executive Director Jenny DeSarro said in a statement. 
There have been four convictions of voter fraud in Wyoming since 2000, according to a database created by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. All four cases involved U.S. citizens. 
Supporters of the new law, including Gray, maintain it is needed to ensure that only Wyoming residents vote in Wyoming elections. In February, the Wyoming Legislature passed House Bill 156, “Proof of voter residency-registration qualifications,” before Gov. Mark Gordon let it become law without his signature.
Gillette Republican and former Wyoming Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. John Bear was the lead sponsor of the bill. 
“The people of Wyoming overwhelmingly support this no-brainer law, and rightfully expect the attorney general to vigorously defend it in court,” the Freedom Caucus posted Monday on Facebook.  
The suit names Gray and each of the state’s 23 county clerks in their official capacities as defendants. 
“Proof of citizenship and proof of residency are common sense, conservative measures pivotal to election integrity, which is why house Bill 156 was the number one priority of our conservative election integrity agenda during the 2025 Legislative Session,” Gray said in a press release.
“I will be vigorously defending Wyoming’s proof of citizenship and residency requirements. We will fight this lawsuit and the false claims in it. And we will win.”

The law specifies what documents provide proof of residency and citizenship, but leaves the secretary of state’s office to iron out the technicalities through the rulemaking process. That requires a public comment period, which is currently open. 
Undue burden
In many instances, a valid Wyoming driver’s license will suffice for proof of identity, residency and U.S. citizenship under the new law. Under the rules now being proposed by Gray, those documents will work so long as they list a Wyoming address. 
But the process won’t be so simple for other voters, the complaint argues. 
“This is particularly true for young, low-income, and already underrepresented voters,” the suit states. “Many more do not have documents that match their current name—including women who changed their names after marriage.” 
And obtaining such documentation will “require navigating a labyrinth of bureaucracy, all with attendant costs and delays, while election day draws nearer.”
Others still, the complaint argues, won’t realize they need such documentation “until it is too late and will be disenfranchised altogether.”
The suit points to voters who may think they are still registered despite “Wyoming’s uniquely aggressive voter list maintenance.” 
Around this time last year, for example, more than 83,000 Wyoming registered voters were purged for not having voted in the most recent election — accounting for a roughly 28% drop in the state’s registered voters. 
Plus, there may be added confusion since the state “allows a much wider range of documents to prove identity to satisfy its voter ID law” as compared to its new proof of residency and citizenship laws, “including student IDs, Medicaid insurance card, even Wyoming concealed firearm permits,” according to the complaint.

Altogether, the new law “favors people who have lived in the same place, with the name they were given at birth, and have a safe and stable place to store their sensitive documents,” the plaintiffs argue. 
“But many citizens, who are no less entitled to vote, do not enjoy these conditions.” 
Constitutional vagueness 
The plaintiffs also argue the new law is unconstitutionally vague as written, which was a concern shared by Gordon when he allowed the bill to become law without his signature. 
In particular, Gordon pointed to a section of the new law that instructs county clerks to accept a prospective voter’s proof of citizenship so long as it does not contain “any indication” that the person is not a U.S. citizen. 
“This standard may be difficult for clerks to administer, as it is unclear and perhaps awkward for our county clerks to consistently apply with any degree of certainty,” Gordon wrote in a letter explaining his decision not to sign the bill. 
The lawsuit makes a similar point. 
Such a standard “both fails to allow persons of ordinary intelligence to anticipate how the law will be enforced and invites arbitrary enforcement, it is void for vagueness,” the complaint states. 
The lawsuit also points to other states that have attempted to add proof of residency and citizenship requirements to the voter registration process, including Arizona, Kansas and New Hampshire. 
“Other states have tried to impose similar restrictions, and their experience proves that the real effect of the [new law’s] requirements will not be to safeguard Wyoming’s elections from noncitizen voting — a problem that does not exist,” the complaint states. “Instead, the new restrictions will exclude citizens from the electoral process.”
The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl, according to the case docket.

Ryan Zinke speaks at a press conference announcing the launch of the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus, while Montana Rep. Troy Downing listens. (Courtesy photo)Montana U.S. Rep Ryan Zinke, a Republican, joined with Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NewMexico, to launch a new bipartisan congressional coalition focused on conserving America’s public lands and expanding access to natural resources for all Americans. 
At a press conference in Washington D.C. last week, Zinke announced the launch of the Public Lands Caucus, which he will co-chair with Vazquez, comprising 14 members of the U.S. House representing districts across country, but heavily centered in the West. 
“Our public lands is not a Republican or a Democrat issue. It’s an American issue, and we should use it in that context of being red, white and blue,” Zinke said during the press conference announcing the caucus’ formation. “It’s important that we talk about better management to preserve and defend why we live in the West and why America’s greatest idea should be preserved and defended.”
Zinke was the former Secretary of the Interior during Donald Trump’s first administration before resigning amid a series of ethics investigations. 
The caucus’ goal is to bring lawmakers together to advance “practical, consensus-driven public lands policy that conserves national resources while supporting recreation, local economies and public access,” according to a press release from Zinke’s office. 
“Make no mistake, our public lands are this nation’s great equalizer. On the water, on the land or in the back country, we all benefit equally from the foundations laid by great conservation leaders like Aldo Leopold and Teddy Roosevelt,” Vasquez said during the press conference. “Public lands and public access to our forests, rivers, grasslands and deserts are a unique American experience that we must continue to fight for and that we cannot take for granted. They also help support a multi billion dollar industry, an outdoor recreation that powers rural communities, connects Americans to their history and to their heritage, and allows us to pass on our traditions to the next generation.”
In addition to the two founding caucus chairs, the Public Lands Caucus includes representatives from Michigan, Idaho, California, North Carolina, Colorado, Virginia, Washington, Nevada, Arizona and Montana. 
Rep. Troy Downing, a freshman congressman representing Montana’s eastern district, told reporters at the press event that “100%” of Montana’s representatives supported the idea. Downing referenced his time serving on the Montana Land Board while he was the State Auditor, a five-member board that managed 5.5 million acres of state land, where he helped manage lands by “sustained yield,” to preserve them for generations.
“In Montana, public lands, public land access, hiking, hunting, fishing are incredibly important to us. You could say it’s in our veins, making sure that we are being stewards of these incredible assets,” Downing said. “But that’s not just Montana. That’s not just the western states. It’s not a partisan issue. I don’t care what side of the aisle you come from, or if you come from neither side of the aisle. You care about this. You understand.”
Many conservation-focused groups expressed their support of the new coalition, including Trout Unlimited, Ducks Unlimited, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and Western Landowners Alliance.
Public lands have become a political flashpoint in recent months as the  Trump administration has promoted the idea that federal lands are part of the nation’s “balance sheet” and could be utilized to help pay off the national debt. 
In early April, when the U.S. Senate passed its federal budget, Montana’s two Republican Senators, Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, bucked their party in a vote for an amendment which would have prevented the sale of public lands to lower the federal deficit, though the amendment failed 49-51. 
Showing that all of Montana’s congressional delegation shares a similar idea on keeping public lands public, Zinke reintroduced his “Public Lands in Public Hands Act,” earlier this year with Vasquez, a bill which would ban the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Forest service from selling or transferring “most public land,” except in specific circumstances. 
And in Helena, a resolution which would have supported a Utah lawsuit against the federal government seeking to transfer federal land to the state, was defeated in the Legislature on a 33-66 vote. 
But the issue continues to gain traction. 
Late Tuesday night, the day before Zinke announced the launch of the new caucus, House Republicans on the Natural Resource Committee approved an amendment that authorizes the sale of thousands of acres of federal land in Nevada and Utah. 
The proposed sales and exchanges are part of a large budget reconciliation bill that will require a vote before the full House. 
The lands involved are almost all near the urban areas of Las Vegas, Reno and St. George, Utah, and appear aimed at allowing for affordable housing developments on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land. 
The move has drawn opposition from Democrats and conservation groups. 
Tracy Stone-Manning, a Montanan who used to lead the BLM under the Biden administration and is now president of the Wilderness Society, told NPR that the move was the start of a bigger push to transfer federal lands. 
“Congress is considering selling off our public lands to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy,” Stone-Manning said. “What we’re seeing from this administration is no balance at all.”
During the Public Lands Caucus press conference, reporters asked Zinke about the committee actions, and Zinke responded, according to Politico, by saying he would make it clear to House leadership that he opposed the idea. 
“I strongly don’t believe (land sales) should be in the reconciliation bill,” Zinke said, though he did not explicitly say that he would oppose the entire reconciliation package as it stands.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/831A4243-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 19:07:33.610940

(Courtesy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln)LINCOLN — A new vaccine strategy developed and tested by a team from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln could signal an end to the annual flu shot routine.
The possible breakthrough is laid out in newly published research in Nature Communications. The study, “Epitope-Optimized Vaccine Elicits Cross-Species Immunity Against Influenza A Virus,” describes a vaccine that protects against H1N1 swine flu and can also protect against influenza in birds and humans.

“This research sets the stage for developing universal influenza vaccines so people won’t have to go to the doctor and get a flu shot every year,” said Eric Weaver, director of the Nebraska Center for Virology who led the Nebraska research team. “This vaccine will protect you against the different strains that are out there.”
 Named after computer software

According to a UNL news release, swine vaccinated with immunogens designed in Weaver’s lab showed no signs of illness after being exposed to a commonly circulating flu strain. They developed antibodies against multiple viruses from several decades and several species and maintained their immune response throughout the six-month study.
Based on the study results, Weaver said that immunity in pigs could last at least a decade. “We hope that would translate into humans,” he said. 
Called the Epigraph vaccine, after computer software used to design it, the vaccine significantly outperformed a commercial vaccine used by the pork industry and a “wild type” vaccine based on naturally occurring strains with similar immunogens.
Both the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture supported the study.
The newly published findings confirm previous research that showed the vaccine design protected against the H3 influenza subtype. Weaver said the new results are particularly encouraging because H1 swine flu variants are detected twice as often as H3 variants and have nearly three times more genetic diversity.
“This H1 subtype is the largest and most genetically diverse subtype in pigs,” Weaver said. “It’s also among the viruses that jumped from swine to humans to cause the 2009 swine flu pandemic. It’s a big target and one of the harder targets to hit.” 
The UNL team noted that influenza A infects as much as 15% of the human population and causes thousands of deaths annually. Today’s vaccines often lack long-lasting protection because of the genetic diversity and rapid mutation of proteins that help form the virus.

Another challenge in controlling influenza, according to UNL, is that it infects multiple species, including birds, swine, horses and dogs, along with humans. “Swine often act as a mixing vessel because they are susceptible to human and bird flu variants, contributing to the evolution of novel forms of the disease that can be transmitted back to humans,” the statement said.
UNL offered as an example the 2009 swine flu pandemic, transmitted from hogs to humans. About 25% of the human population was infected with the new variant, and more than a half million people died from it in the first year, according to some estimates. 
“If we can prevent influenza in swine, we can also prevent zoonotic jumps from avians through swine to humans, or from swine directly to humans,” Weaver said. “We could basically cut off this evolutionary arsenal or advantage that the virus has.”
A goal, he said, is to produce a pediatric vaccine that will protect people throughout most of their life — and, ultimately, eradicate influenza. 
 Flu strains back to 1930

Weaver’s vaccine strategy, which has been patented, used the Epigraph software to study genetic codes of more than 6,000 strains of influenza virus from 1930 to 2021 and create a vaccine that represents their most common epitopes. 
Epitopes were described as regions on a virus that trigger the immune system to produce antibodies to neutralize the virus and to send T-cells to destroy infected cells. Also according to the news release, some epitopes disappear as the virus evolves. The computer-derived Epigraph strategy increases the likelihood that the vaccine contains the epitopes needed to trigger an immune response and prevent illness. 
“Our ability to understand how viruses evolve has increased exponentially in the past 20 years,” Weaver said. “What I see on the horizon is a third wave, where we go from good vaccines to universal, lifelong vaccines.” 
The UNL team now plans to test a vaccine to protect against both H1 and H3 strains of influenza. 
Weaver said that he doesn’t have a projection yet for when the longer-lasting vaccine for humans might be available, but said his team is in discussions with a biotechnology company for that purpose.

Brad Little touted tax cuts and public school funding as key takeaways from this year’s legislative session.
In a news conference on Monday in Nampa, Little reflected on the outcome of the 2025 session of the Idaho Legislature and ongoing federal cuts — by the executive branch and proposed by Congress.
With the over $400 million in tax cuts Little signed into law this year, the governor said he and state lawmakers have cut taxes by $6 billion in the six years he’s been in office. 
“Idaho has proven that we can give back consistently while taking care of the needs of a very fast growing state,” Little told reporters.
He also said since he became Idaho’s governor, the state’s support for public schools has boosted 60% — from a $1.7 billion budget to now over $2.6 billion. 
Early on in the legislative session, Little expressed concern about the high amount of tax cuts proposed by the Legislature — which were well over the $100 million the governor proposed in his budget. 
Asked how he felt about the state’s finances after signing the tax cut bills, Little pointed to the future. 
“I remember the speaker saying, ‘Oh yeah, we can afford it.’ And he’s exactly right. We can afford the 400 million. But the issue is, where are you in year two, year three, year four?” he said.
“Right now, we’re still about the fastest growing state. And if we can continue, we’re going to be fine. But I just don’t think most Idahoans think we ought to bet on being the fastest growing state forever,” Little continued.

 Idaho Gov. Little reflects on signing private school tax credit bill

In his State of the State address at the start of the legislative session, Little proposed putting $50 million to allow tax dollars to be spent on private schools. But later in the legislative session, he said he worried the private school tax credit bill — which proposed that same amount of funding — didn’t have enough accountability.
Asked why he signed the bill, Little said government oversight of those funds rose to six state tax commission employees amid negotiations. And he said the bill excludes families earning over a certain high income, and overweighs for disadvantaged students.
“Those were all components of what I asked for,” Little said. “I would have done it a little differently. But literally, everything I get from the Legislature, I would have done a little differently. That’s part of our constitutional process.”
 Idaho governor vetoed a medical freedom bill. Then he signed a revised version.

The governor only vetoed one bill from the Idaho Legislature this year: A sweeping “medical freedom” bill that bans requirements for vaccines or any medical treatment as a condition of entering or receiving services from businesses, schools, and state and local governments
In his veto letter, Little said he worried the bill would prevent schools from sending home sick kids. 
Then about a week later, he signed a revised version of the bill that allows schools to send home sick kids. 
Little told reporters Monday that lawmakers fixed his issue with the bill. But asked whether the bill will also block businesses from sending home sick employees or customers, he didn’t seem sure.
“That will obviously be determined,” Little said. “My veto was predicated on what it did for public schools.”
 Idaho Gov. Little heads to Washington, D.C., amid federal budget cut talks in Congress

Little said on Tuesday he’s heading to Washington, D.C., to talk about executive branch federal cuts that affect Idaho — including those by the executive branch that ended grants for the city of Pocatello.
For many of the grants halted or paused, the money is still available, he said. 
“We need to see how the money gets reallocated. There’s a lot of that taking place. I haven’t seen anything that rises to the magnitude that is something that we need to be urgently concerned about,” Little said.
Congress is also debating massive federal cuts to extend tax cuts in what has been dubbed the “big, beautiful bill.” Little said he wonders what’ll be in the bill, and how it impacts Idaho.
“We’re one of the most efficient states,” Little said of Idaho’s management of Medicaid. “And that’s one of the things I’m worried about is they categorically tell all the states ‘We’re going to cut your program by such and such.’”

Jeff Colyer, who is edging closer to filing as a 2026 Republican candidate for governor, chats with former Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius during a ceremony on steps of the Kansas Capitol in 2023. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Former Gov. Jeff Colyer’s campaign for governor accelerated with appointment of a treasurer in advance of filing for the Republican Party’s nomination in 2026.
Colyer, 64, served as Kansas chairman of last year’s campaign by President Donald Trump. He is a former Johnson County member of the Kansas House and Senate who was lieutenant governor on the ticket with GOP Gov. Sam Brownback. Upon Brownback’s resignation to serve in the first Trump administration, Colyer was sworn in as governor in 2018.
Colyer sought a full term as governor but narrowly lost the 2018 primary to Republican Kris Kobach, who was defeated in the general election by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. In terms of the 2026 race, Colyer has yet to formally register as a candidate with the secretary of state.
Colyer did announce selection of state Rep. Kyle Hoffman, a Coldwater Republican, as treasurer for his gubernational campaign.
“Kyle is a leading voice for rural Kansas and a great advocate for fiscal responsibility and conservative values,” Colyer said. “He’s going to be a huge asset as we carry our winning message to every county in Kansas.”
Kelly, who followed her defeat of Kobach with a victory over former GOP Attorney General Derek Schmidt in 2022, cannot seek reelection. Colyer was poised to seek the Republican nomination for governor in 2022, but withdrew following a diagnosis of prostate cancer.
Democratic Governors Association spokesman Sam Newton said in a statement Colyer was the “failed right-hand man” to Brownback.
“Besides reminding Kansans of the broken budgets and underfunded public schools of the Brownback era, Colyer’s announcement confirms that the GOP primary field is going to be crowded, chaotic and focused on extreme partisan policies,” Newton said.
Newton said Kansas would be better off with a governor like Kelly who took a middle-of-the-road approach to leadership, balanced the state budget, promoted business investment and ended the state’s sales tax on groceries.
Hoffman, treasurer of Colyer’s campaign, said Colyer was “more than a politician, he is a humanitarian – selflessly serving those in need around the world. He’ll make a great governor.”
Colyer, a surgeon in the Kansas City area who served international medical missions, was the state’s 47th governor from January 2018 to January 2019.
He was lieutenant governor under Brownback from 2011-2018. He was in the Senate from 2009-2011 and the Kansas House from 2007-2009.

(Photo by Shaun Griswold / Source NM)Those who suffered losses in prescribed burns gone awry in New Mexico’s historic 2022 wildfire season are asking the courts to intervene, following what their lawyers say are failures by the federal government and Congress to make victims whole. 
In the spring of 2022, the Cerro Pelado Fire, the Hermits Peak Fire and the Calf Canyon Fire escaped containment lines to become runaway wildfires, all of them first ignited by the United States Forest Service as prescribed burns. The Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon Fires merged in late April of that year and grew into the biggest fire in New Mexico history. 
In total, the fires burned nearly 400,000 acres, and left livelihoods and homes destroyed in their wake. 
Last week, thanks to a federal judge’s intervention, a dozen victims of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire finally received full compensation, while lawyers representing Cerro Pelado Fire victims recently filed a lawsuit against the United States Forest Service, setting up a difficult battle in federal court. 
In the scar of New Mexico’s largest wildfire, a legal battle is brewing over the cost of suffering

The court has emerged as a last resort for compensation amid ongoing concerns about the distribution of $5.45 billion compensation fund for Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims Congress created in late 2022, along with an unsuccessful effort by members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation to create a similar fund for Cerro Pelado Fire victims, lawyers for victims of both fires said in recent interviews.
“Here we are, three years later, after the devastation of the burn scar, my clients finally got their day in court,” Brian Colón, attorney with Singleton Schreiber, a firm representing Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims, told Source New Mexico. “They got compensation awarded for the trespass that the federal government conducted when they were negligent three years ago.”
A ‘watershed’ for Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims
Federal Judge James Browning took a day and a half last week to listen to testimony from a dozen victims of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, who each described in detail the financial cost and also the emotional toll of the federally caused, 534-square-mile wildfire.
One by one, Judge James Browning ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees the fund Congress created, to award them thousands of dollars. The judge stepped in as part of a “judicial review” allowed for in the act Congress passed when the parties cannot agree on an appropriate compensation amount. 
By the time the victims testified in court, FEMA had offered them low or sometimes no money at all for certain categories of losses. Notably, Browning ordered FEMA to provide the victims so-called noneconomic damages, akin to pain and suffering payments, for the emotional hardship the fire caused. FEMA had provided each of them a final payment offer listing “$0” for noneconomic damages.
Even though last week’s hearing involved only a dozen clients, the payments ranging between $9,000 and $330,000 represent a “watershed” moment and a measure of closure in a legal battle pending for more than a year, Colón said. FEMA initially said the law Congress passed only allowed the agency  to pay victims for losses that carry a price tag: burned homes, forgone business revenue and evacuation expenses, for example.
By intervening to hear individual cases, Browning had to evaluate and quantify aspects of victims’ experiences such as their proximity to the fire as it was burning; their anguish as they fled the blaze; and the extent of the “nuisance” and “trespass” the fire represented on their property.
After federal judge’s order, NM fire victims should seek to describe their anguish, lawyer says

Late last year, in a separate, more-sweeping lawsuit, Browning ordered FEMA to begin awarding noneconomic damages, saying in a 99-page ruling that the damages are allowable under New Mexico state law and the law Congress passed.
That order remains pending, and, as with the individual cases Browning ruled on last week, can still be appealed. FEMA and the United States Attorney’s Office, which represents the agency in court, have declined to say whether they plan to appeal. 
While the victims’ lawyers have “no indication what FEMA’s intentions are,” Colón noted that his firm has filed lawsuits on behalf of hundreds of named victims, each of whom could go before Browning in the coming months to seek whatever recourse the judge deems fit to award. 
“We’re gonna put as many of them in front of Judge Browning as he will permit, in whatever timetable he dictates,” Colón said. “And we’re optimistic that he is going to continue dedicating a very substantial amount of time to try and move these cases forward.”
Browning announced in January he intends to retire in February 2026 after 22 years on the bench. 
While the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in noneconomic damages for all victims who seek them is still pending, the FEMA claims office Congress created is continuing to award compensation for other types of losses. 
According to the latest figures, FEMA has paid 16,966 claims totaling $2.35 billion for things like reforestation, business expenses, damaged property and losses local governments incurred responding to the fire. 
Victims left out due to ‘cover-up’, lawsuit alleges
In enacting the Hermits Peak bill, members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation have said they envisioned the accompanying claims office as a way to swiftly and fairly pay victims of the fire without the need for a costly and time-consuming court battle. 
A new lawsuit alleges a Forest Service “cover up” denied people living within the Cerro Pelado Fire the same opportunity.  
In late April of this year, lawyers representing 20 plaintiffs, including individual property owners and the Jemez Pueblo and Jemez Mountains Electric Cooperative, filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service for the 46,000-acre fire in the Jemez Mountains, alleging that agency was negligent in failing to monitor the area for still-burning embers in the pile of thinned trees and brush it ignited after the snowpack had melted.
The lawsuit also accuses the Forest Service of covering up its failure to monitor the pile by issuing an initial investigation determining the cause of the fire to be “inconclusive.” Moreover, the lawsuit says, the Forest Service only ordered a second investigation that ultimately concluded the wildfire had begun as a “holdover” after a “whistleblower” and others raised issue with its original determination.

“The [Forest Service’s] cover-up of the actual cause and origin of the wildfire resulted in the  victims of the fire being left out of the Hermit’s Peak Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act,” the lawsuit alleges.
A spokesperson for the Forest Service did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit Monday afternoon from Source New Mexico.
Chris Bauman, the plaintiffs’ lawyer with B&D Law Offices, told Source New Mexico on Monday that even after New Mexico Democrats U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez and U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján sponsored the Cerro Pelado Fire Assistance Act, he never thought the separate bill had much of a chance of delivering compensation like the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act did. 
“We were told by people that know more about how things work in Washington that it was a long shot,” he said. “So really we didn’t have much expectation, but obviously we were hopeful.”
Winning a lawsuit against the federal government is difficult, Bauman said, due to the “discretionary function” exemption to the Federal Tort Claims Act. That exemption prohibits the federal government from being liable if employees acted within the scope of their duties during a harmful act. 
Bauman’s firm needs to prove that the Forest Service employees who lit the fire in January violated a mandatory policy when they failed to notice that the pile of debris they had lit smoldered undetected for months until catching a huge wind gust on April 22, 2022. According to the lawsuit, the burn plan laying out the series of pile burns in the area requires continuous monitoring, especially after the snowpack disappears. 
“So that’s what we’ve tried to highlight in our complaint, is that there were multiple instances where they were required to do things under the burn plan and failed to do so,” he said.
Feds try to skirt responsibility in lawsuit for people who died after state’s biggest wildfire

It’s not clear how much damage the fire caused, in terms of dollars, Bauman said, though he acknowledged it’s far less than the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. Still, he said, the victims’ only recourse is a lawsuit with a high bar to clear.
“The government will probably file the motion to dismiss, claiming lack of jurisdiction because of the discretionary function defense. We anticipate that will be sort of the first challenge to our case,” he said. “Hopefully we’ll survive that.”
Once the information had emerged that the Cerro Pelado Fire had escaped from a pile burn, the state’s congressional delegation in October 2023  introduced legislation similar to the Hermits Peak bill to compensate victims. It’s been stalled ever since.
Leger Fernandez told Source New Mexico on Monday in an emailed statement that she has not given up on Congress passing the Cerro Pelado Fire Assistance Act and fully compensating those victims like the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Act aims to do.
“We continue to push for the Cerro Pelado Fire Assistance Act because the communities harmed by that fire deserve justice—just like the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon survivors,” she said. “When Democrats were in the majority, we were able to pass the Hermits Peak legislation because we had leadership in the House, Senate, and White House that prioritized disaster relief. Unfortunately, that’s no longer the case.”
Republicans have refused to advance the Cerro Pelado bill “despite repeated efforts,” she said. She also cited the recent firing of the FEMA administrator a day after he testified that FEMA should still exist.
“It’s clear that the Trump White House isn’t focused on helping disaster survivors,” she said.
“We’re not giving up. We’ll keep fighting to get Cerro Pelado survivors the compensation they deserve.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_0514-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 19:07:33.610940

The program, known as RGGI, established a carbon credit auction for electricity producers in 11 northeast states to pay for the right to emit carbon dioxide. The money received would go to each state for uses, ranging from utility assistance and energy efficiency projects to subsidies for alternative energy.
Gov. Tom Wolf entered the compact in 2022 over the objections of Republican state lawmakers. They raised concerns it would increase electricity prices, hasten the closing of the commonwealth’s remaining coal power plants, and not reduce carbon emissions overall, but simply force them into other states.
In a legal challenge to the program’s constitutionality, GOP leaders in the  House and Senate contended the requirement to buy carbon credits was an impermissible tax. A Commonwealth Court panel of five judges agreed.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In its decision, the appellate court said that Pennsylvania’s participation in RGGI must be approved through the General Assembly and that the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) does not have the authority to impose a tax.
Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration appealed, with the DEP,  arguing that the commonwealth’s membership in RGGI is authorized by the state’s Air Pollution Control Act (APCA). The law empowers the state to enact rules and regulations to reduce pollution, including establishing fees used to eliminate air emissions.
Several nonprofit citizens rights and environmental groups including Penn Future, the Sierra Club, the Clean Air Council and the Environmental Defense Fund moved to intervene in the appeal. They argue the Commonwealth Court wrongly decided the case because it failed to consider the DEP and Environmental Quality Board’s obligations under the Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA) to the state constitution. The groups also back the DEP’s argument that the agency is empowered to establish fees to enforce the APCA.
Adopted in 1971, the ERA requires the commonwealth to preserve public natural resources for the benefit of all people. It’s considered one of the strongest such constitutional protections in the nation, according to PennFuture.
Since the Commonwealth Court’s decision in 2023, Shapiro has introduced a Pennsylvania-focused alternative to RGGI called the Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction Act (PACER) that he said would leverage the commonwealth’s status as an energy exporter to fund carbon-neutral energy development. 
Sen. Carolyn Comitta (D-Chester) who plans to introduce legislation to establish PACER, said Shapiro’s alternative was developed in collaboration with Republican lawmakers and energy companies. Comitta said the Supreme Court case and RGGI would make the Supreme Court case moot, but GOP lawmakers have said the plan falls short of their goals to reduce energy costs and ensure reliable electricity supplies. 
The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday in Harrisburg. An audio stream of the proceedings is available on YouTube.

Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer.Kevin Kinney, auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of St. Paul-Minneapolis, joined Minnesota Catholics Monday at the Capitol, urging state lawmakers to keep a program that allows undocumented people to receive free or discounted health insurance.
“I’m here because of my love for the immigrant brothers and sisters and (because)  we need to continue to reach out and walk with them and help them,” Kinney said at a Capitol press conference. “We need to be able to offer health care to anyone who is here, no matter how they got here, who let them in. Are we going to let them die on the streets? Are we gonna let them suffer? Or are we going to allow them — all of us — the basic health care that we need?”
The bishop’s decision to use his moral megaphone — on the heels of the recent election of Pope Leo XIV, who is set to become a leading American advocate for the world’s poor and dispossessed — arrives at an auspicious time: Legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz are making final decisions on a state budget that could fray Minnesota’s relatively robust safety net.
Republicans, who share control of the 67-67 Minnesota House, are against allowing undocumented people to access MinnesotaCare.
The leaders have been meeting daily for over a week behind closed doors to come to a deal on a two-year budget expected to exceed $60 billion. The session ends on May 19, after which Walz would have to call a special legislative session so lawmakers can agree on a budget by June 30. Otherwise the government shuts down on July 1.
MinnesotaCare was created in 1992 to help close the gap in coverage for low-income working families who make more than the income threshold for Medicaid, which is called Medical Assistance in Minnesota.
In 2023, the DFL trifecta expanded the social safety net to include undocumented immigrants, which began on Jan. 1 this year.
Enrollment has surpassed estimates, and Republicans argue undocumented people should be taken off the rolls to save money and discourage people from moving here for coverage.
The Department of Human Services says that its most recent data show that as of April 24, 20,187 undocumented people had enrolled in MinnesotaCare. The program is fee-for-service, meaning the state only pays claims after services are administered.
DHS says it has received 4,306 claims for service, costing Minnesota $3.9 million. This is nearly $1 million over what the state had projected by this date, according to DHS. Some of the undocumented immigrants on MinnesotaCare pay a monthly premium, like other residents who are on the program.
The Minnesota Catholic Conference — the public policy arm of the Catholic Church in Minnesota — lobbied for the creation of MinnesotaCare in the 1990s.
“How do you steward the gift of life if you don’t have access to basic health care? MinnesotaCare is a really comprehensive set of programs and health care benefits, and it’s just really important that low-income people have access to good preventative — not just acute — care,” said Jason Adkins, executive director of the Minnesota Catholic Conference.
Adkins said the MCC has met with Republican leaders on the issue, but they “haven’t seen a lot of policy movement.”
U.S. House Republicans released a proposal this week that would cut Medicaid coverage for millions of low-income Americans. The bill would also target states that allow Medicaid coverage for undocumented immigrants by reducing federal funding for all childless adults without disabilities to 80% from 90%. It’s unclear if this would impact MinnesotaCare, which is not part of Medicaid.
Kinney said that the immigration system needs to be fixed at the federal level, but until then, Minnesotans can take steps to ensure all people, regardless of their immigration status, can have access to health care. He encouraged legislative leaders to think of creative solutions to continue to fund MinnesotaCare for undocumented people.
“You know, I don’t know what we do, but … we shouldn’t let fear take over when we put our priority in the love of (our]) neighbor,” Kinney said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2720-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 19:07:33.610940

The Indianapolis hearing was the second and final opportunity for the board to openly weigh Ritchie’s plea for a commuted sentence.
Ritchie, who has been on Indiana’s death row since his 2002 conviction, is set to be executed May 20 for the 2000 killing. 
The five-member panel heard from a remorseful Ritchie at the Indiana State Prison last week, but the condemned man did not appear at the latest hearing in Indianapolis. Instead, the session was reserved for public comments from those who oppose — and support — clemency.

The governor, in tandem with the parole board, can elect to commute a death sentence to life imprisonment.
Nine of Toney’s family members, friends and fellow police officers at the Beech Grove Police Department who spoke at Monday’s hearing were resolute: “Deny clemency.”
“It’s time. We’re all tired,” said Dee Dee Horen, Toney’s widow. “It is time for this chapter of my story, our story, to be closed. It’s time for us to remember Bill, to remember Bill’s life, and not his death.”
The officer was also survived by two daughters. Neither spoke at the hearing.
Horen, a Beech Grove elementary school teacher, rejected Ritchie’s claims that a difficult childhood fueled his actions.
“I’ve taught 100 Benjamin Ritchies, and they had difficult upbringings, and they had obstacles in their lives, and to my knowledge, none of them made this decision — none of them made a choice to be a criminal and kill a police officer,” Horen said. “We all have choices in our life, and he chose to kill Bill.”
She called on the board, and the governor, to follow through with Ritchie’s execution “because we believe in a system that honors its protectors and punishes those who choose to destroy our peaceful towns.”
The board will make a recommendation, but a final clemency decision about whether to commute Ritchie’s death sentence to life in prison without parole will ultimately be up to Gov. Mike Braun. There’s no timetable for the board, or Braun, to issue opinions.
A ‘cowardly ambush’
More than 20 law enforcement officers — including a dozen from the Beech Grove Police Department — attended Monday’s hearing.
Per court documents, the underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at the police officer, who did not survive the shooting.
Ritchie said that on the night of the incident, he was with a group trying to steal rims from car dealers. He said the subsequent police chase “sped out of control” and ended in a “shootout.”
The inmate said he regretted his “horrible actions,” which Ritchie and his legal team have attributed to an unstable upbringing and lifelong brain damage from fetal alcohol exposure.
‘I am so sorry’: Clemency hearings begin for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie

Beech Grove Deputy Police Chief Robert Mercuri, who was a sergeant and supervisor in charge on the night of the killing, was involved in the initial vehicle pursuit and was among the first to render aid after the shooting. 
“I found my friend Bill lying on the ground in that backyard. I attempted CPR. I rode with him in an ambulance to Methodist Hospital, praying the entire time that he would survive,” Mercuri recalled. 
He said Toney had volunteered to work an extra shift to help a colleague that night. Mercuri called Toney “a rising star in law enforcement” who “brought energy and optimism” to the job and was a role model to other officers.
He refuted Ritchie’s claims of a shootout, emphasizing that Toney was targeted by “a cowardly ambush.”
Ritchie hid in bushes and fired the first shot at Toney while the officer was clearing a fence, Mercuri told the parole board. He said the inmate still “does not own up to his dishonorable act.”
“Benjamin Ritchie continues to put out there that he was just some kid, and and the truth is that he is a conniving, manipulating predator who prays on the weak, good and unsuspecting people of the world,” Mercuri said, adding that he “would victimize the weaker prisoners and create a bunch of Ben Ritchies, emboldened by the fact that he played the system,” if granted clemency and allowed to enter the general prison population.
Tyler Banks, with the Indiana Attorney General’s Office, additionally argued against clemency based on Ritchie’s repeated violent behavior in prison. He pointed to Ritchie’s 43 conduct reports since 2001 that stemmed from assaults of officers and other inmates, in addition to threats, intimidation, disorderly conduct and other “disruptive” incidents.
“He’s tried to convince you that if you commute his sentence, he will not be a problem, but an asset, for those other offenders in general population,” Banks said. “His conduct in the highly-structured environment of death row proves otherwise.”
Although Ritchie claims his earlier defense lawyers were “ineffective” because they failed to present his FASD diagnosis at trial or in post-conviction proceedings, Banks maintained the trial record already contained extensive evidence of prenatal substance abuse.
“All that Ritchie has that is new or different is simply a new name for a diagnosis,” Banks said.
A ‘hidden disability’
But an hour-long presentation from a mental health expert argued otherwise, emphasizing that Ritchie suffers from a “hidden disability” that went undiagnosed for most of his life and his condition has only recently been investigated.
Dr. Megan Carter, a forensic psychologist and expert in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), told the board she diagnosed Ritchie with pFAS, or partial FAS. Carter noted in her evaluation of Ritchie that he has 15 of the 23 deficits of the disorder. 
She said he especially struggles with speech, emotional regulation, academics and social skills.

“People think that is a childhood disorder, but it’s really a lifelong disorder,” Carter said. “It’s often known as a hidden disability because … you can’t see the problem. But you see it in their behaviors and their emotions.” 
The inmate’s current counsel said prior lawyers “completely failed to investigate the source of Ritchie’s serious brain damage” because they “erroneously believed” he lacked the facial features that are commonly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure — like small eyes, a flat midface and thin upper lip.
Carter said less than 10% of individuals with FASD exhibit those facial features, though.
FASD inhibits a person’s ability to process information quickly and understand consequences, and also impacts their decision-making skills, emotional regulation and abstract thinking, Carter explained. She held that people with FASD, “in a lot of ways,” have brains similar to toddlers.
The psychologist cited evidence that Ritchie’s birth mother drank heavily during pregnancy and was neglectful during his early childhood. In addition to the FASD diagnosis, testing of Ritchie’s baby teeth revealed significant lead exposure.
Carter said Ritchie’s neurodevelopmental condition left him especially vulnerable to reacting violently under stress.
“When he gets into stressful situations, like this was on that night, his frontal lobes — which are already not functioning very well — kind of go offline, and he goes more into a primitive, survival mode,” Carter said. “That means that he’s not thinking about consequences. He’s not considering other people’s perspectives. He’s just simply reacting.”

She noted that in “emotionally-charged situations,” those with FASD “tend to be more reactive” due to a faster and increased release of cortisone and other stress hormones.
“The situation was unique. It was different than he’d ever experienced,” Carter continued. “It was unpredictable, emotionally-charged, unstructured and unsupported, and that’s when individuals with FASD have the most trouble conforming their behavior to what’s expected.”
The expert additionally maintained that an earlier diagnosis and “external supports” in school and at home might have changed the course of Ritchie’s life. Had he been diagnosed with FASD before age six, Ritchie would’ve had a “higher chance” of staying out of the criminal justice system.
“A lot of people have had really terrible childhoods, right? They were beaten, they were neglected, and they don’t go on to commit crimes. But they don’t have a lot of behavior dysregulation. They don’t have severe deficits like (Ritchie),” Carter said. “We’re not going to see the neurocognitive scores that we see in FASD. … I think those things are important to acknowledge as contributions to his brain development and his social development.”
John Mast, a former special education teacher who worked with Ritchie for more than three years starting in the early 1990s, further described him as a student with a “severe emotional handicap” that “affected all aspects of life,” including in the classroom.
Mast recalled Ritchie’s “violent and aggressive” outbursts in response to “minor,” everyday disruptions like a lost pencil or school bus delay.
“Given my experiences with Ben as an adolescent, this situation was the exact type of situation where those severe emotional disabilities became fully evident and engaged,” he said. “He did not have the emotional tools, he did not have the skills, to make a different and acceptable decision.”
Indiana death row inmate seeks SCOTUS intervention weeks before scheduled execution

Members of the parole board asked about Ritchie’s psychological profile, his ability to understand consequences, and whether new neuroimaging might shed more light on his condition and his thinking at the time of his crime.
Ritchie’s attorney, Steve Schutte, said “those are legitimate questions” that the defense team wanted to explore before the Indiana Supreme Court, but the justices denied requests for a new hearing. The inmate’s lawyers are now seeking a last-minute execution pause from the U.S. Supreme Court.
“The governor and this board now have to make a decision without the kind of process we’d usually rely on,” Schutte said.
“(Ritchie) is not looking for sympathy,” Schutte added. “What he’s asked is to be allowed to spend the rest of his life in prison.”
Neither the governor nor any current members of the state’s parole board have deliberated a death penalty clemency case before Ritchie’s.
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976.
The most recent was in 2005, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels commuted the death sentence for Arthur Baird, who killed his pregnant wife and her parents in 1985. Although the parole board denied his petition for clemency, Daniels granted Baird clemency one day before the scheduled execution, in part citing questions about Baird’s sanity.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)It’s been a disappointing year for Minnesota’s parents of young children and the advocates hoping to secure more investments in child care. 
Across the state, child care centers are shutting down, exacerbating the shortage of day care spots. Meanwhile, the cost of care continues to climb; only Washington, D.C. and Massachusetts have higher average infant child care prices. Child care workers in Minnesota earn on average just over $15 per hour, often less than they could make at Target or a restaurant.
Now, a plan by President Donald Trump to cut funding is threatening the already-precarious child care system.
Teachers and advocates for Head Start, the federal program that provides subsidized child care to low-income families, gathered at the Capitol Monday — with hundreds of preschoolers in tow — to protest proposed Head Start cuts and the lack of state action to counteract them.
More than 12,000 Minnesota children could lose their care if Head Start funding expires at the end of September. 
Advocates with Kids Count On Us — a child care advocacy group affiliated with the religious organization ISAIAH — rallied for state and federal spending on child care in conjunction with National Day Without Child Care events around the country. 
“Minnesota needs to be bold about raising revenue to fund the things we need, like a fully funded child care system, so it is affordable and accessible for all families,” said Reneé Olsen, who runs child care centers in Barnum and Willow River.
The threats to Head Start come on the heels of an especially difficult six months for child care. 
Although Gov. Tim Walz says he wants to make Minnesota “the best state to raise a family” — and Vice President J.D. Vance fancies himself a beacon of pro-family public policy — neither the state nor the federal government plan major investments in child care anytime soon. 
In Washington, Republicans are rolling back programs that provide child care to low income families, at the behest of Vance and the world’s richest man, presidential advisor/donor Elon Musk. Vance co-authored an essay in the Wall Street Journal in 2021 arguing against child care subsidies; instead, the government should reward parents who choose to stay at home and raise children, Vance wrote. 
More than 80% of stay-at-home parents are women. 
And in Minnesota, there’s not money in the state coffers this year to make up for the potential loss of federal funds. The state is already spending more money than it’s bringing in, and with tax increases off the table for Republicans, Walz and legislative leaders are looking for ways to cut spending. 
November’s budget forecast, which predicted a $5 billion deficit in 2027 and 2028 if current spending trends continue, ended hopes of wide-scale state-level investment in child care before the legislative session began.
State Sen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, said a tax on social media companies, which was included in the Senate’s recently released tax bill, could help pay for investments in child care. But in the House, which is tied 67-67, Republicans have vowed to vote against any tax increase.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG_8937-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-12 18:10:04.417984

Dan McKee, right, are at odds on whether cabinet members should get raises this year. (Photos by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi have rarely, if ever, butted heads in their four years leading the executive and legislative branches.
That might be about to change.
The Rhode Island House of Representatives is slated to vote at 4 p.m. Tuesday on a resolution rejecting McKee’s proposal to raise salaries for 11 of his department heads. 
If approved by both chambers before the April 18 deadline, the veto would mark the first instance of the legislature exercising its legal power to reject the executive’s annual cabinet raises.
McKee wants to give raises to 11 state department heads. Not so fast, Shekarchi says.

McKee insists the annual pay bumps are necessary to attract and retain top workers to the state, matching other state government jobs and the private industry.
“When the Governor came into office, many cabinet salaries had fallen behind industry standards, failed to keep up with inflation, and in some cases, were lower than the salaries of other department staff—making it difficult to recruit from out of state or promote from within.,” Olivia DaRocha, a McKee spokesperson, said in a statement Monday, 
Shekarchi, who as House Speaker has final say over the state’s annual budget, says it’s not the time to dole out raises.
“Given the current challenging budget outlook, as well as the tremendous uncertainty in Washington, the House members strongly feel we must reject these requested raises,” Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, said in a statement Monday afternoon. “This is no reflection on the job performance of the Cabinet members.”



The House resolution has nine co-sponsors, including House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale, a Foster Republican; House Majority Leader Christopher Blazejewski, a Providence Democrat; House Finance Chairman Martin Abney, a Newport Democrat; and the chamber’s lone independent, Rep. Jon Brien of Woonsocket.
The annual authorization for the state’s executive to raise department heads’ pay each April is typically met with passive approval by the Rhode Island General Assembly. Under state law, the governor’s proposed cabinet raises automatically take effect within 30 days unless both chambers take formal action to reject them through a joint, concurrent resolution. 
The Senate has not yet scheduled a vote to stop the raises as of Monday; its leadership leadership is still discussing the resolution, and has not decided whether to take action, Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson said. 
In 2022, McKee walked back his initial salary increases, agreeing to spread out pay bumps over two years in response to concerns from lawmakers. In 2013, former Gov. Lincoln Chafee in 2013 withdrew his proposed 6% raises for cabinet heads due to concern from legislative leaders of both parties, according to news reports.
But there’s no record of the legislature ever taking formal action to reject proposed cabinet raises, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi, said previously.
When McKee rolled out raises for 11 cabinet members in March, Shekarchi appeared caught off-guard, telling WPRO in a March 24 interview that he found out about the proposed salary hikes by reading a Providence Journal story published days earlier. Shekarchi expressed reservations about doling out raises given the state’s forecasted budget deficit. McKee stood firm.
McKee’s proposal includes 5% raises for nine cabinet heads, along with a 2% raise for Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr., and a 0.5% bump for Col. Darnell Weaver, Rhode Island State Police superintendent and director of the public safety department. 
The proposed increases, combined, would cost an additional $82,000 combined.
DaRocha described the raises as “modest” and “fiscally responsible.” 
On Friday,  state budget crunchers adopted revised revenue forecasts predicting an $80 million boost to state coffers in the current year and the upcoming one.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) The state’s precarious financial situation is looking slightly more sturdy.
An extra $60.7 million is now expected to flow into state coffers by June 30 under new estimates adopted by state budget crunchers Friday. The rosy conclusion to the biannual Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference also projected $19.3 million more revenue for fiscal 2026.
The combined $80 million projected revenue increase for this year and next shaves nearly one-third off the expected $250 million budget deficit. Which leaves lawmakers with a $170 million spending gap to close — not insignificant, especially against the backdrop of potentially devastating federal funding cuts and warnings of a “recession-adjacent” economic slowdown. 
Indeed, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi’s reaction to the updated revenue numbers Friday was not exactly celebratory. “The revenue results preview the effects of the weakening US economy linked to turmoil in Washington, DC,” Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, said in a statement. “Any short-term positive news is overshadowed by the magnitude of that uncertainty and the many related or unsolved budget issues.”
Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, and Senate Finance Chairman Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, also referenced the uncertainty of federal funding in a joint statement reacting to the updated state revenue estimates.
“We remain committed to passing a balanced, responsible budget in time for the state’s new fiscal year, which begins on July 1, and if subsequent developments in Washington necessitate additional action, we will be prepared to address that at the appropriate time,” they said Friday.
Yet the latest state forecasts suggest revenue is rising across a wide array of tax sources. Personal income taxes, which account for one-third of the state’s $5.6 billion annual revenue forecast, are now expected to come in $37.1 million higher by June 30, with an extra $10.1 million in fiscal 2026. The state is also poised to bring in more money through lottery taxes (up $15.4 million over the next two years combined) along with taxes on public utilities, insurance companies, and cigarettes.
These gains will be partially offset by less-than-expected income from sales and use taxes, trimmed by $22 million in fiscal 2025, and down another $37.1 million in fiscal 2026. The state also won’t be generating as much revenue from taxes on bank income; the expected $12.3 million fiscal 2025 revenue from financial institutions taxes is one-third of the $39.5 million forecast six months ago. 
In response to state budget analysts, the Rhode Island Division of Taxation said it initially thought additional taxes paid in 2023 reflected an increased tax liability for 2024, when in fact the elevated 2023 returns were the result of overpayments.
How much of the loss in expected bank tax revenue reflects a change to state tax code enacted by lawmakers in June at the request of Citizens Bank was not immediately available. The controversial tax rewrite, which took effect Jan. 1, was expected to reduce fiscal 2025 revenue by $7 million, rising to $15 million for the full fiscal 2026 year, based on the lower tax bill for Citizens.

Clayton Airport (City of Wolf Point photo)Federal spending cuts could be coming to rural airports across the country, with a national program utilized by seven Montana airports facing a $300 million downturn.
In early May, Russell Vought, Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, sent a letter detailing federal cuts the executive branch wants to make in the fiscal year 2026 budget.
The letter included cutting $308 million from the Essential Air Service, or EAS, a program that directs federal money to air carriers operating in rural environments. 
“The EAS program funnels taxpayer dollars to airlines to subsidize half-empty flights from airports that are within easy commuting distance from each other, while also failing to effectively provide assistance to most rural air travelers,” the document reads.
It is unclear what impact any cuts would have on Montana, but the proposal would effectively halve the program’s budget. Montana has seven airports that receive money through EAS — Butte, West Yellowstone, Glasgow, Glendive, Havre, Sidney and Wolf Point. 
Five of those — Glasgow, Glendive, Havre, Sidney and Wolf Point — are run through Cape Air and the federal funding subsidizes direct flights to Billings.
Montana has a group dedicated to EAS, helmed by Walt McNutt, the state’s EAS Task Force Chairman. Along with working with elected officials, the task force is also part of the contract process with airlines like Cape Air, which inked a four-year contract with the five airports doing Billings runs in 2023. The four-year deal with those five airports totals about $75 million.
McNutt has seen attempted cuts to the service before, which haven’t always come to fruition.
“I could have had a heart attack probably 10 times in 30 years over it if I let myself,” McNutt said to the Daily Montanan. “There’s going to be a lot of dialogue, a lot of information. You know, unfortunately, you probably had a Senator or a Representative get on an EAS flight that was half full and go berserk.
“When they do the final analysis of it, really looking at the facts and the boardings in the service, a lot of minds get changed pretty quickly.”
The four members of Montana’s Congressional Delegation did not return a request for comment. All four of Montana’s delegations are Republican.
McNutt, Dawson Airport Manager Craig Hostetler and Sidney Airport Manager Ryan Huotari all pointed to one of the main benefits of the program, connecting people with larger cities that don’t have a lot of options to get there.
It’s a problem public transportation advocates pointed to repeatedly during the 2025 Legislative session.
“We’re kind of an older community, and a lot of med flights,” Hostetler said. “People are using it to get to Billings in order to take care of the medicals and such. A lot of people use it for connecting flights, because Billings is a small hub and we can get on the bigger airlines there. So it gets used by a variety of different people.”
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, Montana had 2.87 million “enplanements,” an aviation term meaning a passenger boarding a plane, in 2023.
About 2.5 million of those boardings came from airports in Bozeman, Missoula, Kalispell, and Billings. Bozeman led the way with 1.2 million.
Butte and West Yellowstone received about $2.5 million combined through the EAS program in 2023 for SkyWest to operate flights to Denver and Salt Lake City out of both airports.
West Yellowstone had 8,750 passengers in 2023, an increase of 19.11% more than the previous year. Butte had slightly more than 16,000 passengers in 2023.
Sidney had 8,000 boardings — a 22% increase more than 2022 — with Wolf Point, Havre and Glasgow each having around 3,000 boardings. Glendive had 2,177 boardings in 2023.
“It’s vital,” McNutt said. “We don’t have an interstate, we don’t have a bus, we don’t have a train, we don’t have anything in eastern Montana except the airlines.”

(Courtesy of New Jersey Governor's Office)The Louisiana House of Representatives leadership added money to its state budget proposal to avoid a public school teacher pay cut that was expected after a March constitutional failed to pass. 
The House Appropriations Committee approved a budget plan Monday that contains $198 million to cover stipends for K-12 school teachers and school support staff. They are in line to receive $2,000 and $1,000, respectively, in the 2025-26 academic year. 
House leaders found the money by delaying $92 million worth of government acquisitions, including the purchase of new state vehicles and equipment, for another year. Legislators also proposed paying off retirement debt for Louisiana State Police troopers early, resulting in an additional $25.5 million in savings that would be used to cover the teacher stipends. 
House leadership will also sideline a “high-dosage” tutoring program for public school students that was put in place after the COVID-19 pandemic to find another $30 million for the stipend. 
Their strategy also relies on a temporary state government hiring freeze and the elimination of state employee “work from home” benefits to produce at least $20 million in savings. 
The Louisiana Department of Health would also lose $26.3 million in state funding under the House leadership plan. These savings will be achieved, in part, by removing people from Medicaid who have moved out of Louisiana or otherwise don’t qualify for the government health insurance. 

The health department has recently started to check its Medicaid enrollment information against the state’s Office of Motor Vehicle database in order to cut coverage for people who no longer live in Louisiana. 

The state also conducted an extensive Medicaid enrollment check during most of last year as part of a national effort to reduce Medicaid bloat from the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s unclear how much the ongoing OMV review will cover the same ground. 
In addition to the teachers’ stipend, the House leadership also added funding to avoid cuts to domestic violence shelters and advocacy centers that provide services to children who are victims of crime. They also added approximately 750 more slots for seniors and people with disabilities to receive home assistance as well as tens of millions of dollars worth of lawmakers’ pet projects. 

Notably, the House leadership has avoided cutting any funding for the new LA GATOR private school voucher program that Gov. Jeff Landry favors. If the governor gets his way, nearly $100 million of public money will be used to cover private education costs next school year.
Teachers have been at risk of losing their pay stipend – given out the past two years instead of a permanent salary increase – after voters rejected a state constitutional amendment March that the governor pushed. 

The amendment would have made dozens of changes to Louisiana’s tax and budget structure, a few of which were expected to produce enough savings to make the stipend a permanent part of teachers’ salaries. Nearly two-thirds of voters balked at the overall proposal, however, deeming it too complicated. 

Before the election, Landry and Republican lawmakers said teachers would only retain their current pay level if the amendment passed. But after the amendment failed by a large margin, several legislators retreated from that stance. 

House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, said the majority of House members have told him in recent weeks that they wanted to find a way to keep the teacher stipend in place this year.
The leader of the Louisiana Federation of Teachers, the state’s largest teacher union,  was encouraged by the budget change.
“We think this is a good first step,” LFT president Larry Carter said in an interview.
The solution is temporary, however. All of the funding McFarland has proposed to cover teacher stipends won’t be available again next year. 
House leaders are hoping the stipend won’t be needed in 2026 because the state will have the resources to offer teachers and support staff permanent salary increases. They are pushing to put several segments of the amendment that failed in March back on the ballot next spring as simpler, individual ballot items. They include the constitutional changes needed to free up money for the teacher salary bump equivalent to the current stipend. 
The Louisiana House is scheduled to vote on the budget proposal Thursday. The Senate will then take up the proposal, and the two sides must reach an agreement on the funding plan by June 12.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/42712297215_30935ab2e2_c.jpg,,,2025-05-12 18:10:04.417984

Thirty percent of corn and 16% of soybean acres have emerged as of Monday. 
Stu Swanson, president of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said despite weather delays last month, his fields, and those in his north central region are “sitting in a really good spot.”

“Farmers tend to be worriers,” Swanson said. “We worried that we weren’t going to get back in, and we appreciated the rain because now we’re looking dry and we’ll need a little shot of rain to get the rest of the soybeans to go.” 
Swanson said he was able to plant all of his corn between April 11 and 15, then faced a 16-day delay due to the rain, which set soybean planting behind slightly. Swanson said he finished planting beans late last week. 
Statewide, 76% of corn acres and 64% of soybean acres have been planted. 
Swanson said cold rain in the middle of April caused some “spotty” corn emergence in some fields, which he said has led to some replanting in those areas.
Overall, the rain has meant adequate moisture in 70% of topsoil and 67% of subsoil. 
State Climatologist Justin Glisan said Iowa had “unseasonable warmth” with some regions of the state logging temperatures 10 degrees or more above normal. 
Warm temperatures and an average rainfall for the state of 0.05 inch, led to nearly seven days suitable for field work during the reporting period of May 5 -11. 
According to the crop report, 6% of the state’s first cutting of alfalfa has been completed. More than 80% of hay and oats rated good or excellent.
The U.S. and China  announced Monday they agreed to a 90-day pause in trade-war tariffs, which Swanson said caused a bit of a “jump” in soybean prices. 
“That was great, but we’ll need an extended rally just to get them back to where we were earlier in the year,” Swanson said.

File photo by Peng Chen/VTDigger A Swanton man is facing a murder charge for allegedly fatally shooting another man who had recently been staying in the same home as he was early Saturday morning. Mitchal Shedrick, 52, pleaded not guilty to a charge of second-degree murder Monday during his arraignment hearing in Franklin County Superior criminal court in St. Albans. The felony offense, according to charging documents, stems from the shooting death of 37-year-old Joshua Many during an argument. Judge Navah Spero granted a request from Franklin County Deputy State’s Attorney Diane Wheeler to hold Shedrick in custody without bail pending a further hearing in the case.The investigation leading to the murder charge began around 3:15 a.m. Saturday when police reported receiving 911 calls from the residence on Fourth Street in Swanton, according to charging documents. Responding officers, the filings stated, found a man, later identified as Many, dead inside.Katrina Montgomery told investigators she was Many’s fiancee and that they had been staying at the residence on Fourth Street for a few weeks, Detective Sgt. Isaac Merriam of the Vermont State Police wrote in an affidavit in support of the murder charge. Montgomery added that several other people resided at the home, including Shedrick, according to the filing. Montgomery said an argument took place between Shedrick and Many in an upstairs room following a dispute that started over money, Merriam wrote. She reported hearing a gunshot and then she ran upstairs and heard Many say, “You shot me” and then “Why did you shoot me?” as he exited Shedrick’s room holding his chest, the affidavit stated. Many made it to a downstairs room, where he collapsed, and Montgomery said she called 911, according to the charging document. Another person at the home at the time of the shooting reported to police that Many and Shedrick had been “bickering back and forth” over a drug debt for more than a week, Merriam wrote in the affidavit. A later autopsy determined Many’s cause of death to be a gunshot wound to his torso, according to the filing.Attorney Paul Groce, representing Shedrick during the arraignment Monday, argued against the prosecution’s request to hold his client without bail. Groce said that based on the charging document there is at least an “outline” of a possible self-defense claim.He added that Shedrick was not a flight risk, having lived at the residence for many years and having limited mobility. Shedrick attended the hearing Monday in a wheelchair.  Wheeler, the prosecutor, countered that the evidence was strong, adding that there were witnesses in the home who provided sworn statements that they saw Shedrick with a gun and heard Many after being shot asking Shedrick, “Why’d you shoot me?”Spero, the judge, said she was holding Shedrick without bail, at least for now, pending another hearing to more thoroughly consider the strength of the prosecution’s evidence in the case.If convicted of the second-degree murder charge, Shedrick faces 20 years to life in prison. Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘Why did you shoot me?’: Witness reports hearing slain Swanton man ask his accused killer .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Franklin-Superior-Court-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-12 18:10:04.417984

The dispute, officially titled Original No. 141 Texas v. New Mexico and Colorado, came to a head in 2024, when U.S. Supreme Court justices struck down a deal proposed by New Mexico, Colorado and Texas to end the litigation. SCOTUS, — in a close 5-4 decision  — sided with the federal government’s objections that the states’ deal unfairly excluded the “unique federal interests,” and sent the parties back to settlement talks, or potentially back to court. In fact, the parties had been scheduled for a June 9 trial in Philadelphia, while still in talks.
On Monday, attorneys for both the core parties told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Chief Judge D. Brooks Smith they are “cautiously optimistic” the case may be resolved in coming months, and promised more details to come.
Jeff Wechsler, the lead attorney representing New Mexico, told the court during a status hearing on Monday he expected documents related to the agreement to be signed later in the afternoon, with subsequent paperwork later this week.
He also requested, on behalf of all the parties, for the court to cancel the June 9 trial date and instead schedule a hearing for later this year.
“Our intent with the request for the hearing is to provide you with everything you need to understand the agreement,” Wechsler said.
Smith serves as the special master for the case, and is charged with overseeing the case and issuing reports for the U.S. Supreme Court, which has final approval over interstate water lawsuits and settlements.
Smith commended the parties and mediator, retired federal Magistrate Judge Arthur Boylan, for the “progress made in this very lengthy litigation.”
The case has changed dramatically since it was first brought to court. In 2013, The state of Texas alleged New Mexico pumping diverted Rio Grande water owed to Texas under an 86-year old agreement: the 1939 Rio Grande Compact, a legal document for splitting the river’s water between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. A compact violation between states can only be addressed in the nation’s highest court.
In 2018, SCOTUS allowed the federal government — which operates a network of dams, and nearly 140 miles of irrigation canals to deliver water to two irrigation districts in the region and Mexico — to join the case as a party. The federal government used similar arguments as Texas: that New Mexico groundwater pumping threatened irrigation and treaty interests.
But alliances reshaped themselves in recent years. In 2022, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas proposed a deal to measure Texas’ water at the state line and include transfers of water between New Mexico and Texas irrigation districts to balance out shortfalls, which the federal government opposed.
It appeared those lines of contention broke down in the most recent negotiations.
“The parties did a good job negotiating in good faith and bridging the gaps on the difficult issues,” said Thomas Snodgrass, a senior attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice representing the federal government.
Some concerns remain for the City of Las Cruces, one of the 12 organizations not a party to the lawsuit that has filed so-called “friend of the court” (amicus curiae) briefs in the case.
Jay Stein, an attorney for the City of Las Cruces, said the state’s second-largest city may not sign the current terms because the current agreement leaves the city “uncertain” on the issues of municipal supply.
Wechsler said amici approval is not required to move the agreement forward — it only requires the sign-off of the three states and the federal government —  but said that the State of New Mexico “believes there is a path forward in resolving these issues,” with Las Cruces to prevent further litigation.
Boylan, the mediator in the case, thanked parties for the “Herculean efforts” to settle the case and said he would continue mediation to address pending issues.

“They have some experience in other states doing this and having success,” the statewide board’s chairperson, Brian Shellem, said after the meeting. “One of our tasks is to attract high-quality people who are already getting it done, so we’re hopeful that they will have a great impact on Oklahoma, especially for kids who have already fallen behind.”
ThrivePoint Academy promises an individualized learning plan, a flexible class schedule, small class sizes and a teacher/coach model “where students have multiple points of contact with adults who understand their struggles and achievements,” former Oklahoma state Sen. Clark Jolley, who leads the school’s governing board, wrote in a letter to the statewide board.
Each student will work with a teacher and a student success coach who will help them develop an academic plan, accelerate their learning and catch up on credits, said Timothy Smith, co-founder and CEO of Learning Matters Educational Group.
Oklahoma has one virtual charter school that serves students at risk of dropping out before graduation. Insight School of Oklahoma enrolls more than 1,100 students and has seen its numbers increase each of the past seven years, state data shows.

ThrivePoint academies have experienced significant growth in Arizona and California, where Learning Matters has run schools for 20 and 15 years respectively, Smith said. That led the group to expand into other states.
After its first application to open a ThrivePoint Academy in Oklahoma was denied last year, Learning Matters applied again in March — this time with a renamed and restocked Statewide Charter School Board. The board used to be known as the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board and had mostly different members.
The new board members asked for more clarity from ThrivePoint’s March application, including in the school’s bylaws, class schedules and fiscal plan. They then approved an updated version of the application on Monday.
Smith said the new Oklahoma board has been more receptive since it was reconstituted last year.
“They’re definitely forward thinking, looking for innovative schools,” Smith said after the vote. “We think that we are one, and so we’re very excited.”

House committee,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/general-assembly/piaa-playoff-reform-bill-advances-out-of-pa-house-committee/,The proposal would allow the PIAA to create separate playoffs and championships for public and non-public schools.,"(Getty Images)The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) may soon be able to create separate playoffs and championships for public schools and non-public schools.
A proposal to hand the association that power passed a state House committee on a bipartisan basis Monday.
Rep. Scott Conklin (D-Centre), sponsor of House Bill 41, believes his measure would correct what he and other supporters argue is an “imbalance” in the current system, which pits public schools, which they describe as “boundary” schools, in the same state playoffs and championship games as non-public schools. They include private, charter and parochial “non-boundary” schools.
Conklin mentioned that a few other states, including neighboring Maryland, currently use this approach.
“It’s worked very, very well,” Conklin said.
He likened his proposal to Penn State football being able to play an Ivy League team in the regular season and being able to “beat the tar out of them,” but ultimately the two schools won’t be vying for the same championship. 
Among the reasons Conklin’s cited in pushing the measure are that in the past, some high schools were talking about dropping out of the PIAA over the issue. He also highlighted how non-public schools only represent a small percentage of schools in the state, but ultimately win state championships at a larger rate.
A Capital-Star report in May 2024 found that at that time, non-public schools comprised 24% of the high schools in the PIAA, but accounted for a disproportionate amount of state champions in most common sports over the past decade.
Conklin also made the case that his proposal is not meant to “harm” those non-public schools in any way.

The PIAA has said that they don’t have the authority to make such a change without legislation. A co-sponsorship memo notes it gives the association the power to make changes.
However, the proposal is not a mandate for the PIAA, unlike a previous 2019 plan that would have mandated the PIAA to hold separate playoffs for public and non-public schools in certain sports.
Several committee members spoke out in support of the bill, including Rep. Jeff Olsommer (R-Pike), who said his brother is a football coach at a public high school in the state.
“I can’t tell you how many times he’s gone into the state playoffs, faced a charter or a private school that is loaded with talent and just gets mowed down. I hear it from the coaches on the staff and his friends of coaches, that this idea that is in this bill that you’re talking about, is widely prevalent and thought of as a great idea amongst the coaches, at least, in my brother’s circle,” Olsommer said.
The bill passed the House Intergovernmental Affairs and Operations Committee by a 20-6 vote and will be referred to the full chamber for consideration.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1427997649-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 18:10:04.417984

Gov. Ron DeSantis and other government officials held a news conference in Tampa on Monday to discuss immigration arrests made last week by the Florida Highway Patrol, which for the first time has that authority.
The Legislature passed and DeSantis signed legislation in February that allows local and state law enforcement agencies to enter into what are known as 287 (g) agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to execute immigration enforcement inside Florida.
Master Sergeant Joshua Malloy with the Troop C Criminal Interdiction Unit of the Florida Highway Patrol said on Monday that troopers “executed an operations enforcement operation” in Tampa last week that resulted in the apprehension of 30 undocumented immigrants in just over an hour.
“While this was the first operation featured on national news, it was part of a much larger effort where state troopers were working either independently or directly with the federal government to enforce federal and state laws,” Malloy added.
That “national news” that Malloy referred to was how the FHP gave exclusive access to a Fox News reporter on a ride-around last week to report on the operation, which featured footage of an FHP officer running after a man on I-4 after “his legal status was questioned,” according to the reporter.
“During this operation, three undocumented aliens fled from one of our traffic stops and ran across several lanes on I-4,” Malloy said — adding that, after the man was caught, he was transported to the Hillsborough County jail and “charged with felony burglary amongst other charges.”
Working with ICE last month in a statewide operation labeled “Operation Tidal Wave,” several Florida law enforcement agencies helped arrest more than 1,100 undocumented immigrants. That will now become the “new normal,” according to Larry Keefe, executive director of the State Board of Immigration Enforcement.
“Florida was kind of like a pushy partner,” Keefe added at the press conference. “We can do more. We have more capacity, more capability.” He displayed a 37-page document that he labelled the “Florida blueprint” to achieve the mass deportations goal issued by the Donald Trump White House.
Authority to deport
Dave Kerner, executive director of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, said that the FHP is “the first in the nation to be delegated federal enforcement authority in the immigration space,” adding that 1,800 state troopers have been credentialed and delegated federal immigration enforcement authority.
“What that means is that if you see a state trooper, he or she has federal authority to detain, investigate, apprehend, and deport,” he said, adding that those troopers have been in some way involved in the arrests of more than 1,000 undocumented immigrants in Florida this year.
DeSantis said that approximately 70,000-80,000 undocumented immigrants have already appeared before immigration judges in Florida. He referred to a proposal under consideration that if approved by the federal government would allow Florida National Guard military judge advocates to serve as immigration judges, establishing temporary detention facilities and providing transportation.


Along with the FHP, Florida law enforcement agencies that have signed collaboration agreements with ICE include the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Florida State Guard, the Florida Department of Agricultural Law Enforcement, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, according to an announcement by DeSantis in February.
Uthmeier’s appeal
Meanwhile, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit last week of a decision by a federal judge in South Florida to block the law (SB 4-C) passed in February that bars undocumented people in the U.S. from entering the state.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida has suspended enforcement of the law but Uthmeier has said he won’t tell state or local law enforcement officials to stop apprehending undocumented migrants, despite the fact that the judge has said she could hold him in contempt later this month. DeSantis has said he stands by Uthmeier’s decision.

This year, a legislator is seeking to modify that requirement so that it no longer applies to minors.
Bill sponsor Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor) and medical experts said Monday that the change would grant health care providers more flexibility when it comes to how and when to discuss concerns or issues related to sexual or gender identity with young people, understanding that these conversations may impact their physical or mental health. 
The bill (LD 1945) would also remove the stipulation that providers collect this data from all patients during each doctor’s visit — a provision that means these conversations are being forced, rather than letting providers assess the best times to ask these questions, Rana said.
The rule change is supported by the Maine Medical Association and the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
During a public hearing before the Maine Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, the health associations both said that the new law allowed people, particularly those in the LGBTQ+ community, to discuss their own identity, rather than have providers make assumptions. However, they believe collecting that information on every visit is unnecessary, particularly for minors who may not be ready to talk about those topics. 
The new bill comes as scrutiny of transgender people, particularly students, is increasing nationwide and in Maine, while some Republican lawmakers are seeking to roll back affirming gender identity protections, including gender affirming care. 
Protecting the privacy and safety of minors is an important goal of the proposed bill, said Madeleine DesFosses, advocacy and public health manager of the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
“Requiring health care providers to collect information through an intake form related to gender identity and sexuality for a minor may put them in an uncomfortable or confusing position,” she said.
“A minor may not feel comfortable or safe disclosing their gender or sexual identity in a healthcare setting. In addition, data may be skewed if a minor doesn’t feel they can be truthful about their gender identity or sexuality in this kind of setting.”
Under current law, anyone can decline to share this information, which the bill does not aim to change.

John Haste, R-Broken Arrow, attends a special session of the state Senate on June 12, 2024, at the Oklahoma State Capitol. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A joint legislative panel on Monday moved one step closer to changing course on a new inpatient mental health hospital.
The state had planned to build a state-of-the art inpatient mental health facility, the Donahue Behavioral Health Campus near the Oklahoma State University in Oklahoma City, but the Joint Committee on Pandemic Relief Funding voted to reallocate some of those funds to other projects.
The new $130 million facility was to be funded in part with federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars and from $50 million the sale of the Norman facility.
Lawmakers said Monday that they still plan to move the state’s inpatient mental health hospital from Norman to Oklahoma City, but want to renovate an existing location.
Sen. John Haste, R-Broken Arrow, told the Joint Committee on Pandemic Relief Funding that the new $130 million construction project, set to open in December 2025, has become unworkable.
“The gap in funding is still not clear, but the last estimate was more than $100 million,” Haste said. “The cost continues to escalate. The land has not been sold and the opening date is now sometime in 2028.”
One site in Oklahoma City has been identified for renovation and can meet the needs to replace the beds at Norman’s Griffin Memorial Hospital, Haste said. That facility has been in use for over a century.
“This pivot from new construction to renovation will save the state both time and money as the replacement of these beds remain critical,” Haste said. 
The excess dollars would be invested in the Tulsa Behavioral Health Project, which has a gap in funding, Haste said.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, moved to reduce the amount awarded to replace Griffin from $87 million to $66.5 million. The motion passed.
“These funds will be used to pay existing expenses and to purchase and renovate a facility to provide additional behavioral health capacity,” Kirt said.
The new campus will have 197 beds, which is more than Griffin Memorial Hospital, Kirt said.
“There’s still a discussion about an annex building and whether that will end up being part of the final project,” Kirt said.
The panel also voted to move $7.9 million from the Griffin replacement project to the Tulsa Center for Behavioral Health, a 56-bed state owned and operated psychiatric hospital. 
“This project will provide much needed mental health services and additional beds for capacity,” Haste said.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Chuck Hall, R-Perry, said the changes will be put into bills and sent through the legislative process, which will give lawmakers and the public time to weigh in.

John Curran, the former Republican candidate for lieutenant governor who said internal sabotage cost him a spot on the primary ballot, announced Monday he is re-entering the race — this time as a GOP-aligned write-in.
“Today, I am announcing my WRITE-IN campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia as a Republican,” Curran said in a statement. “My decision is not to split the ticket but to save it.”
Curran’s announcement reignites tensions in an already turbulent race following his exit in April, when he failed to qualify for the ballot despite claiming to have far surpassed the 10,000-signature requirement. 
“Unfortunately, a person(s) associated with my campaign conspired to steal most of my signatures and then attempted to extort money for them,” Curran wrote in a Facebook post after the filing deadline passed. “Disappointingly, the Virginia Department of Elections and the Republican Party of Virginia did nothing to correct this wrong.”
Mark Peake, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, dismissed Curran’s write-in bid as entirely unofficial, distancing the party from his campaign. 
“He is not running under the GOP banner whatsoever,” Peake said. “We have a GOP candidate, and that’s John Reid.”
Peake pointed out that Curran never qualified for the Republican primary, despite claiming to be a contender. “He failed to get enough signatures to get on the ballot,” he said. “He is 100% not a Republican candidate in this upcoming election.”
And Andrea Gaines, a spokeswoman for the department, said in an email that since write-in candidates do not appear on the ballot, “they do not have party affiliation.”
Political observers say Curran’s surprise reentry raises more questions than answers.
“It is difficult to know what to make of John Curran’s announcement,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. “As a write-in candidate, it seems like the sore loser law might not apply, but it also might limit his campaigning. Regardless, the whole thing seems odd.”
Curran said in his statement that his campaign is fueled by “grassroots organizations, religious and family groups, and collegiate groups” and not designed to divide the party. But by positioning himself as an alternative to Reid, the GOP’s official nominee, he risks deepening an already visible rift within the party.
“Is Curran running to offer an alternative to John Reid? While that might seem a likely scenario, it has the danger of splitting the party,” Richards noted. “And the GOP has already been wrestling with Reid’s candidacy.”
Reid, a conservative commentator and longtime Richmond radio host, became the GOP’s nominee by default after Pat Herrity, a longtime member of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, dropped out for health reasons.  
Late last month, Virginia’s GOP turmoil escalated when Reid accused Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC of attempted extortion, claiming the group offered to make damaging attacks disappear if he dropped out. Reid said the threats came after Youngkin personally urged him to quit over concerns tied to a controversial social media account. 
Reid, the first openly gay statewide candidate in Virginia history, called the situation “bigotry and ugliness,” warning that the pressure from party leaders has only intensified.
Curran alluded to those dynamics Monday, emphasizing that his concern is not Reid’s personal background, but the process that installed him as nominee.
“This issue is not about my opponent being gay; it is about Virginia deserving the ability to choose who represents them as the Republican candidate,” he said.
When asked for comment about Curran’s renewed bid, a campaign spokesman for Reid texted back, “Who?” 
Curran is now betting that Virginia conservatives will rally around a write-in candidacy — a historically uphill battle. “Write-in campaigns are notoriously difficult to pull off,” Richards said, pointing to the failed 2024 effort by Bob Good supporters to mount a last-ditch write-in bid after his congressional primary defeat. 
“Only a few hundred wrote in Good’s name. This time it is a candidate himself announcing the write-in campaign. Maybe he will gain some traction, but it will take a tremendous shift in the GOP vote to make a difference.”
Curran’s platform touches on a range of issues — from housing and disaster recovery in Southwest Virginia to opposing abortion and improving adoption services. 
“Virginia faces real issues that require strong leadership,” he said, portraying himself as a principled outsider wronged by the system. “It is time for common sense and strength, for someone who will fight for everyone.”
Still, his decision could prove costly for Republicans in November.
“Every write-in for Curran will mean a vote taken away from Reid,” Richards said. “That opens the lead for whoever wins the Democratic primary in June.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The sponsor of 2023 legislation that created new workplace protections for temporary workers is blasting a new bill that would remove many of those safeguards. 
“I believe in equal pay. I believe in equal benefits for equal work,” Sen. Joe Cryan (D-Union) told the Senate Labor Committee Monday. 
The new bill, which the committee discussed but did not vote on Monday, comes less than two years after the law known as the ‘Temp Workers Bill of Rights’” went into effect. That law requires employers to provide basic information on jobs in workers’ native language and guarantees a minimum wage to an estimated 127,000 temporary workers, staffed mostly in warehouses and factories. 
Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), sponsor of the new bill, had voted in support of the earlier law, which passed after a years-long push by labor advocates who said the state’s temporary workers were victims of exploitative job conditions and wage theft.
Sarlo’s bill seeks to make several key changes to the temp worker law.
The current law requires staffing agencies to pay temp workers the same pay and benefits given to full-time workers performing the same work. Sarlo’s bill would revise that to remove the benefits provision and leaving only equal pay. Under the bill, equal pay would mean the agency is required to pay the equivalent of a client’s entry-level pay rate for a worker with minimum qualifications. 
A provision of the law requiring staffing agencies to disclose pay rates would also change under Sarlo’s bill, which would reverse that requirement.
The law also applies to New Jersey temp workers who take jobs in other states. Sarlo’s bill would ax that provision, saying it is “causing third-party clients in other states to reduce their use of temporary laborers from New Jersey.” 
Mike Nolfo, a franchisee for Express Employment Professionals, said his company employs nearly 2,000 temporary workers daily at 300 local businesses. Nolfo supports the new bill, and said it’s an opportunity to help mom-and-pop shops that are struggling because of the new law. He agreed that Pennsylvania companies aren’t using New Jersey agencies because of state laws. 
“We lost virtually all of our clients in East Stroudsburg because of this law, because they just don’t want to comply with it,” he said. “There’s a lot of pieces to it. We’re not saying the whole thing. Some of it doesn’t make sense.” 
The temp worker law passed out of the Legislature in February 2023 with the minimum number of yes votes a bill needs to pass the Senate, 21. It went into full effect that summer.
Staffing agencies and business groups sued over the law, claiming it is unconstitutionally vague and makes New Jersey less competitive. Cryan noted the plaintiffs have lost all their legal challenges.
Cryan said supporters of the new bill say it’s aimed at cleaning up mistakes in the law, but he called the measure “far from that.”
Opponents of the bill said weakening the protections of temporary workers only hurts vulnerable people who are abused and exploited in the workplace. Nedia Morsy, executive director of immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New Jersey, said it’s “stunning that in a climate of federal attacks on workers, on immigrants, and on the institutions that protect both, that a bill like this would even see the light of day.”

But the biggest hurdle legislators and Gov. Ned Lamont need to clear involves local schools.
Aggressive budget caps are leaving education and other core programs hundreds of millions shy of what majority Democrats say is necessary to meet current needs, and officials fear larger cuts in federal aid are coming this summer as Congress wraps an unprecedented effort to slash aid to states.
Unless officials can protect rural poor communities facing cuts in basic K-12 grants, boost aid to long-neglected urban centers and continue to fix a growing crisis in special education, the prospects of a budget deal are murky at best.
Can CT continue to shield all districts from education aid cuts?
“If we [won’t] spend less than $10 million [next year] for 81 communities,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, “that’s saying those communities don’t count.”
Osten, who co-chairs the Appropriations Committee, is battling to ensure no district receives less Education Cost Sharing [ECS] grant funding than it currently receives.
A $2.4 billion program that provides the bulk of state aid to elementary and secondary districts, ECS would grow by $85 million next fiscal year under a revised formula lawmakers adopted eight years ago.
Based on that formula, almost half of Connecticut’s cities and towns would lose funding next fiscal year while many others simply would simply break even.
But that system, which is based on wealth, student enrollment, special needs, and past local spending, has a big flaw. Lawmakers haven’t adjusted the foundation payment of $11,525 per student for inflation in more than a decade.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0225_SR_SenateVote_197-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 17:07:48.590498
,DC,2025-05-12 20:58:50+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House GOP mandates Medicaid work requirements in giant bill slashing spending,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-mandates-medicaid-work-requirements-giant-bill-slashing-spending,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans plan to debate and approve the three final pieces of their “big, beautiful bill” in committee this week, including the tax measure, major spending cuts to Medicaid that will change how states run the program and an agriculture bill.At least $880 billion over the next 10 years would be slashed under the piece of the bill that covers energy and health care, including from Medicaid. Republicans would add new Medicaid work requirements for some able-bodied adults; seek to penalize the dozen states that allow immigrants living in the U.S. without legal status in the program; and require states to more frequently check Medicaid enrollees’ eligibility, among other changes.An estimate was not yet available for exactly how much that would save in Medicaid spending or how many people enrolled might lose coverage. Earlier projections of various other scenarios by the Congressional Budget Office had placed the numbers of displaced enrollees in the millions, and Democrats predicted the same effect from the newest plan.House panels have already signed off on eight of the 11 bills that will make up the sweeping reconciliation legislation. And if all goes according to plan, that chamber should approve the entire package before the end of the month.Debate is expected to begin Tuesday in each of the panels and last hours, possibly into Wednesday. Democrats will offer dozens of amendments seeking to change the bills and highlighting their disagreement with GOP policy goals.Internal Republican disputes between centrists and far-right lawmakers over numerous tax proposals and funding changes to Medicaid will also likely lead to debate on GOP amendments.With paper-thin majorities in the House and Senate, nearly every Republican needs to support the overall package for it to move through both chambers and to President Donald Trump.If Republicans fail to reach agreement during the next couple months, it would put nearly every aspect of their agenda in jeopardy. GOP leaders would also need to negotiate a bipartisan debt limit agreement before the August recess, should the reconciliation package fall apart, since they plan to include debt limit language as well.GOP divided over Medicaid cutsKentucky Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, chairman of the committee that oversees energy and Medicaid, wrote in a statement last week announcing the markup that his panel’s measure would “end wasteful government spending, unleash American energy and innovation, and strengthen Medicaid for mothers, children, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly.”But the bill released this weekend might not have support from far-right members in the House and seems to be running into opposition from some GOP senators as well. Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, of the hard right, wrote on social media that he hoped “House & Senate leadership are coming up with a backup plan…. ….. because I’m not here to rack up an additional $20 trillion in debt over 10 years or to subsidize healthy, able-bodied adults, corrupt blue states, and monopoly hospital ceos…”Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who has voiced concern for months about potential cuts to Medicaid, wrote an op-ed published in The New York Times on Monday highly critical of a “contingent of corporatist Republicans” who support lower federal spending on the program.”“This wing of the party wants Republicans to build our big, beautiful bill around slashing health insurance for the working poor,” Hawley wrote. “But that argument is both morally wrong and politically suicidal.”The entire House package will be open to amendment if the legislation makes it to the Senate, where several GOP lawmakers are expected to rework or even eliminate entire sections.Work requirementsThe Energy and Commerce Committee’s bill is the one that would cut federal spending by at least $880 billion during the next decade including on Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower income people.The legislation would institute work requirements nationwide for able-bodied adults between the ages of 19 and 65, with several exceptions, including for pregnant people, enrollees with certain disabilities or serious medical conditions, and parents of dependent children.People not exempted from the requirements would need to work, engage in community service, or enroll in an education program for at least 80 hours a month.A staffer on the panel told reporters during a background briefing Monday that Republicans tried to learn from challenges certain states had in the past when they implemented work requirements.After discussions with current and former state Medicaid directors, the staffer said the committee wrote a bill that they are confident “states will be able to implement effectively.”The work requirements take into account various unexpected circumstances, like if someone were to be hit by a bus and unable to complete the 80-hours-per-month requirement on time because they were hospitalized, the staffer said.“We did try to be very thoughtful about any kind of circumstance that could happen,” they said.Immigrant coverage, eligibility checksThe Medicaid legislation also seeks to encourage states who include undocumented immigrants in their program to stop doing so or lose some federal funding.The federal government currently pays 90% of the cost of covering enrollees who are eligible for Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act expansion. That would decrease to 80% for the expanded population if states choose to keep covering undocumented immigrants.The committee staffer said this would impact California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Washington states if they don’t change their policies regarding undocumented immigrants.Additionally, states would need to check eligibility for all of their Medicaid enrollees every six months, instead of once a year for the expanded population. This likely would lead to some people being kicked out of the program.Committee staff members were unable to share exactly how each of the Medicaid provisions would affect the federal budget or how many people could lose access to the program if Congress were to implement the legislation as written.But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office wrote in a letter Monday that it estimates the Energy and Commerce Committee met its target of cutting at least $880 billion in spending “over the 2025-2034 period and would not increase on-budget deficits in any year after 2034.”Staff on the committee said they don’t expect to have the full CBO score before the markup begins Tuesday and didn’t have an estimate for when that information will be out.Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, D-N.J., wrote in a statement the GOP bill would lead to millions of people losing access to Medicaid.“This is not trimming fat from around the edges, it’s cutting to the bone,” Pallone wrote. “The overwhelming majority of the savings in this bill will come from taking health care away from millions of Americans. No where in the bill are they cutting ‘waste, fraud, and abuse’—they’re cutting people’s health care and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires.”Repealing clean-energy fundsThe Republican proposal would repeal more than a dozen sections of Democrats’ 2022 reconciliation law related to energy and environment programs.The law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, included hundreds of billions in tax credits for renewable energy and energy-efficiency measures. It was considered the largest investment by the United States in tackling climate change.The House bill would repeal sections including the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which helps finance clean-energy projects, and a $40 billion Department of Energy loan program meant to stimulate production of clean-energy infrastructure.Sections targeting carbon emissions, air pollution, offshore wind transmission, and other programs would also rescind any unspent funds for those purposes appropriated in the Biden-era law.The measure would allow pipeline builders to pay fees to bypass environmental review. Natural gas pipelines could pay $10 million to access an expedited approval process and liquified natural gas exports could pay $1 million for the Energy Department to deem them “in the public interest.”Rep. Kathy Castor, the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Energy Subcommittee, said the proposal would sabotage efforts to drive down prices for consumers.“Cleaner, cheaper energy for consumers gets left behind,” the Florida Democrat wrote in a statement. “Dismantling our landmark Inflation Reduction Act will kill jobs, hurt businesses, and drive-up Americans’ energy costs.”Tax cutsThe Ways and Means Committee released its 28-page starter bill late last week and the full 389-page version Monday afternoon, but Republicans on the panel could add to it during the Tuesday markup.House GOP tax writers propose making permanent the underlying 2017 tax law provisions while temporarily expanding several of them, including the child tax credit and standard deduction.The child tax credit would increase to $2,500, up from $2,000, until 2028. The refundable amount of the tax credit per child — meaning how much taxpayers could get back — would now reach up to $1,400. Taxpayers claiming the credit would now have to provide a Social Security number, as well as the SSN of a spouse.The standard deduction for single and married joint filers would temporarily increase until 2029 up to $2,000, depending on filing status.Trump’s campaign promises, including no tax on tips, also made it into the proposal, though only until 2028. Those claiming the tax break on tips will also need to provide a Social Security number as well as the SSN of their spouse, if married.Trump’s promise to eliminate taxes on car loan interest, also set to expire in 2028, would not apply to any vehicle that was not finally assembled in the U.S.Tax writers increased but ultimately left a cap on the amount of state and local taxes, commonly referred to as SALT, that households can deduct, an incredibly contentious issue for lawmakers with constituents in high tax areas like New York and California. GOP lawmakers increased the SALT cap to $30,000, up from $10,000.That level, however, might not have the support needed among Republicans' extremely thin majorities and will likely lead to heated debate during markup, or on the floor.Republicans from higher-tax states have repeatedly said they will not vote for the entire package unless they feel their constituents will benefit from raising the SALT cap.The dispute has spilled over several times already, including in a statement last week from four New York Republicans, who wrote, “The Speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee unilaterally proposed a flat $30,000 SALT cap — an amount they already knew would fall short of earning our support.”“It’s not just insulting—it risks derailing President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill,” they wrote. “New Yorkers already send far more to Washington than we get back—unlike many so-called ‘low-tax’ states that depend heavily on federal largesse.“A higher SALT cap isn’t a luxury. It’s a matter of fairness.”New York Republican Rep. Nick LaLota wrote on social media Monday afternoon: “Still a hell no.”How much the tax proposal will cost has not yet been released, but government deficit watchdogs estimated a wholesale extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, without the enhancements, would cost north of $4 trillion over the next decade.Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said the proposal provides some certainty to individual taxpayers but it also adds complexity in many areas.“You can clearly see the thinking here was probably just a straight-up extension (of the 2017 law), people wouldn’t feel like they got a tax cut because it's just continuing. So they had to do something to make it feel like there's a larger tax cut,” York said.Ag cuts remain a mysteryThe House Agriculture Committee, led by Pennsylvania Republican Glenn 'GT' Thompson, hadn’t released its bill as of Monday afternoon but was scheduled to begin the markup on Tuesday evening.That panel is supposed to cut at least $230 billion in federal spending during the next decade, some of which will likely come from reworking elements of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.Committee leaders are also planning to include elements of the much overdue farm bill, though those provisions could run into issues in the Senate if they don’t have a significant impact on federal revenue or spending.Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move the package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship. Reconciliation measures must address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit in a way not deemed “merely incidental” by the Senate parliamentarian. That means the GOP proposals must carry some sort of price tag and cannot focus simply on changing federal policy.Jacob Fischler and Ashley Murray contributed to this report.",,,,2025-05-12 17:07:48.590498

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Lawmakers expressed concerns Monday about whether the state’s mental health department is adequately reimbursing a group of specialized providers who care for uninsured Oklahomans.
Lawmakers peppered the state’s chief financial officer and a special expert appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt with questions about whether providers who operate certified community behavioral health centers are being correctly compensated for services after Oklahoma Voice last week reported that several providers said they’re owed close to $150 million in unreimbursed costs during the 2024 and 2025 budget years.  
Aaron Morris, the state’s CFO, and David Greenwell, who has temporarily been appointed by Stitt to oversee the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ finances, were the latest officials called to testify before a special legislative committee probing the agency’s financial shortfalls and ongoing disarray that’s resulted in contracts being cut or canceled and warnings that the department can’t afford to pay its nearly 2,000 employees. 
Both men said the state agency would need a supplemental appropriation to make ends meet and make payroll for the rest of the current fiscal year, but said they were still trying to determine what that amount is. They said that supplemental request would not include the $150 million that several providers have said hasn’t been reimbursed by the state agency. 
While these providers haven’t historically been reimbursed for 100% of these services and the agency isn’t contractually obligated to do so, reimbursements have been made when funds are available, Morris said. 
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, who chairs the select committee, said many providers have received these payments for years and built them into their business models. Lawmakers will consider including funds for these reimbursements in a supplemental appropriation, he said, but paying state employees and “getting through” the current fiscal year comes first. 
Joy Sloan, president of the Alliance of Mental Health Providers of Oklahoma, a coalition of eight certified community behavioral health centers, has said that providers generally aren’t reimbursed for all claims and don’t expect to be.

In a letter addressed to Mental Health Commissioner Allie Friesen and sent to lawmakers on Monday, Sloan wrote that while she understands Friesen’s burden, the recent financial cuts have placed an “unprecedented strain” on Oklahoma’s certified community behavioral health centers. 
“Without financial support to offset the costs for those unable to pay, our ability to sustain this open-access model is in jeopardy,” she wrote. “Some of us may be forced to reduce services, lay off staff, or close programs. None of us want that. Therefore, considering this challenging budget year, and in the spirit of shared responsibility, charity and compromise, we request that ODMHSAS consider funding some portion of these services.” 
In total, the eight providers have over $84 million in services not reimbursed this fiscal year. Slightly over 1 in 4 clients was uninsured, according to the letter. 
Following the hearing, the mental health department released a statement that said the agency has not traditionally budgeted separately for the payments but instead used funds still available at the end of the year. 
Friesen had asked a former employee to create “an algorithm to assist providers in estimating and planning” for those payments, but it wasn’t completed, said Maria Chaverri, the agency’s spokesperson, in a statement.
She acknowledged “significant and sometimes unrealistic mandates” that make the current payment model “challenging” for providers, and said the department is working to “restore the model’s original fidelity” to ensure the monthly contract rates are sufficient.
“Several factors have contributed to the current rise in pended payment amounts, including systemic shifts such as the transition to managed care, broader state-level reforms, and increased service mandates placed on (certified community behavioral health centers),” Chaverri said in a statement. 
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said she’s worried that those provider payments are being viewed as “optional” when the Legislature mandates that the services be provided. It has increased the number of uninsured receiving treatment, she said. 
“I’m worried that we’re going to view it as optional when actually they’ve built this capacity based on our requirements,” she said.

Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, asked that Morris and Greenwell consider including the payments in the supplemental budget request for the current fiscal year and in the budget request for the upcoming fiscal year. 
He said the budget request would not be accurate without them.
“We will be back here next year with a giant headache on our hands if we shut these providers down,” he said. “Because we all know that we’re going to treat these people somewhere, and it’s going to be somewhere in the system, and I’d much rather be in the mental health system than in jails and in the court system.”
Morris, the state CFO, said they will provide lawmakers with the “support” to make that determination. 
Immediate needs and obligations, like making payroll, are the priority, Morris said. One lawmaker said around $1.5 million has been added to the mental health department’s payroll by new executive staff hires. 
Morris and Greenwell did not offer a dollar amount on how much would be needed for a supplemental appropriation at Monday’s hearing, but said they planned to get a number to lawmakers later that day. 
The two financial experts said they would be meeting with leaders from the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency to finalize and compare numbers Monday. 
“There are human beings behind every single dollar we’re looking at,” Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, said. “People in crisis, people in need of services, and please don’t lose focus of that.” 
After lawmakers are presented with a request for an appropriation, they will internally review it before it can go through a joint committee on appropriations and budgets.

(Screenshot of postcard)Hoosier voters will soon be receiving postcards in the mail from the Secretary of State’s Election Division as part of statewide voter registration list maintenance.
A news release issued Monday said the goal is to identify outdated, duplicate, and inaccurate voter registrations to improve the accuracy and integrity of Indiana’s list.
There are currently 4,644,046 registered voters in Indiana.
Residents don’t necessarily have to respond upon receipt of an initial postcard.
But if a postcard is returned as undeliverable, a second postcard will be sent to the forwardable address on file with the U.S. Postal Service.  The second postcard will ask a voter to confirm or update their residence address or cancel their Indiana voter registration using a postage pre-paid voter response card. Hoosiers who receive a second postcard should follow the instructions to complete and return the pre-addressed, postage-paid response card to the Election Division.
This process is required by federal and state law.
The release said a registration “flagged” as inaccurate by this process can only be canceled by a county voter registration board if the flagged registration is not utilized for voting in two successive federal elections. Voters can correct or update a flagged registration by mail, in-person at their county clerk’s office, or at the polls when they vote in a primary or general election.
The next election in Indiana is the primary on May 5, 2026. The general election is Nov. 3, 2026.
This process has led to approximately 800,000 inactive or outdated voter registrations being canceled in Indiana over the past two list maintenance cycles, according to the release.
“Sending these postcards is an essential step in maintaining clean and accurate voter rolls,” Secretary of State Diego Morales said. “It helps identify outdated or incorrect information and ensures our voter registration lists reflect current, eligible voters. This process is vital to protecting the integrity of our elections and upholding voter confidence across Indiana.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-12 20:48:27+00:00,CT Mirror,CT officials on federal Medicaid cuts bill: ‘Designed to hurt people’,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/12/ct-officials-federal-medicaid-cuts-proposal/,CT officials warned that federal Medicaid cuts outlined in a Congressional Republican plan would have devastating consequences.,"Connecticut officials on Monday warned that Medicaid cuts outlined in a Congressional Republican plan would have devastating consequences, even though the changes stop short of the scenarios that would have most heavily impacted enrollee benefits and the state budget.
In a plan released on Sunday, House Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee provided details for the first time on how they propose to find $880 billion in spending cuts in order to meet the Trump administration’s budget priorities. Among other measures, the plan would implement 80 hours of work, volunteer or educational requirements a month for certain enrollees and freeze the hospital tax, a mechanism that enables states to increase the amount of Medicaid funding they receive from the federal government.
“This bill has a number of provisions that seem designed to hurt people in Connecticut, that seem designed to take coverage away from folks, to put our hospitals into financial difficulty,” Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, co-chair of the state legislature’s Human Services Committee, said during a press conference at the state Capitol on Monday.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont, said that the state is evaluating the impact of the proposal on residents and the state budget, but “it’s clear that these proposed cuts will have a significant impact on every state.”
“In the meantime, the Governor will continue working with DSS, our legislative leaders, and our Congressional delegation to mitigate any damage from potential cuts and preserve access to quality care for the most vulnerable residents in our state,” Blanchard wrote in emailed comments.
Some of the most drastic changes to the program floated over the last several months, including reduced federal matching and a per enrollee cap on federal funding, are not included in the plan. Lesser said the absence of those proposals is a sign that “there’s really been an impact from this public outcry” that’s taken place over the last several months.
“Republican members of Congress are hearing from their constituents when they hold town halls. They’re being reminded that Medicaid is a program that people in red states and blue states rely on,” Lesser said.
Medicaid, known as HUSKY in Connecticut, covers roughly 1 million people in the state, according to the Department of Social Services, which equals just about 25% of the population.
States depend heavily on the federal government to pay for the program. The state’s Office of Policy and Management projects Connecticut will spend a total of $11.6 billion on Medicaid this fiscal year. The federal government contributed roughly $6.9 billion, or 59%, of that funding.
The state is in the process of analyzing how Medicaid work requirements would impact the state budget, Christine Stuart, a spokesperson with the Department of Social Services, confirmed. 
State officials in the past have criticized work requirements for being expensive to implement and based on incorrect assumptions that Medicaid enrollees don’t work. Although they are more moderate than some of the other changes Democrats feared, Pareesa Charmchi Goodwin, executive director of the state legislature’s Commission on Racial Equity in Public Health, said bureaucracy will likely lead to loss of coverage, even for those who qualify. 
“It is a lot of additional layers of administration and bureaucracy that are very difficult for people to navigate, and people end up losing benefits even if, for example, they are working,” Charmchi Goodwin said on Monday at the Capitol. “It’s deeply, deeply concerning.”
The Connecticut Hospital Association called the proposal, including the plan to freeze hospital taxes, “an attack on states and the way state budgets are developed to fund Medicaid.”
“If federal contributions to state Medicaid programs are frozen, over time healthcare providers will have no choice but to make up the significant losses elsewhere or cut back on services. This would be devastating to affordability and access,” Paul Kidwell, senior vice president of policy at CHA, stated in emailed comments.
The proposal would also implement copays for certain Medicaid enrollees, require eligibility screening every six months instead of every year and penalize states, like Connecticut, that provide Medicaid-like coverage to children and people who are pregnant or postpartum regardless of immigration status. 
Connecticut provides Medicaid-like state-sponsored coverage regardless of immigration status to children 15 and under, as well as people who are pregnant or postpartum, who have qualifying incomes. 
The federal government covers roughly half the cost of coverage for traditional Medicaid enrollees, but for those who don’t qualify for Medicaid because of their immigration status, the state bears 100% of the costs. However, the feds provide 65% of the funding for prenatal coverage, even for those who wouldn’t qualify because of immigration status.
Lesser called the attempt to prohibit states like Connecticut from providing coverage regardless of immigration status a “huge overreach,” particularly considering they do so without the support of federal funding. He predicted the measure would face legal challenges.
Additionally, the plan seeks to ban Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming care for transgender kids and prevent providers who perform abortions from receiving Medicaid funding for any services they provide. Federal law already prohibits federal funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or life endangerment of the pregnant person.
Amanda Skinner, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, said the provision would leave “thousands of patients in Connecticut with nowhere else to turn.”
“In Connecticut, 46% of PPSNE’s patients rely on HUSKY Health to receive services like birth control, cancer screenings, wellness exams, STI testing and treatment, and more. We are their trusted source of care. Our health centers are an irreplaceable part of Connecticut’s health care system,” Skinner wrote in emailed comments.
Lesser conceded that the proposal includes a limited number of measures he sees as beneficial to residents, including provisions to rein in the power of pharmacy benefit managers, companies that serve as middlemen to help manage drug benefits for health plans, but have recently come under fire for driving up prescription drug costs.

Photo courtesy Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and MarketsCamila Van Order González is a reporter with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship, on assignment for the Hardwick Gazette.Since the emerald ash borer was first detected in Vermont in 2018, Plainfield has been unlucky in its relationship with the invasive beetle. The town was a hotspot for infestations in late April, leaving dry, rotted-out ash trees ready to crash.But Hardwick, just a few towns north, has never seen any confirmed case of emerald ash borer, according to the state.“It’s a good lesson in how the insect spreads,” said Noah Hoffman, the invasive species coordinator for the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation. “Most of the emerald ash borer in the state –– we put it there.”The emerald ash borer chews its way through forests with little regularity; it often spreads as a result of human activity, being carried on infested firewood or logging timber. They are most likely to use ash trees, which make up 6% of Vermont’s trees by volume, as hosts for larvae. The bugs have been spotted in 96 out of Vermont’s 247 municipal areas, Hoffman said.That there are no emerald ash borers in Hardwick could be attributed to the work that foresters, educators and town management have done to slow the spread. “The state has done a great job with their educational outreach,” said Rose Paul of Plainfield’s conservation commission, “and we’ve tried to do our part in town.”READ MORE





 


As the emerald ash borer munches on, Vermont tries to protect ash trees that are left 

by Seamus McAvoy 
April 25, 2021, 12:25 pmApril 25, 2021, 2:12 pm 



Hoffman said the state Agency of Natural Resources’ educational programs have been a big success in slowing the insect’s spread, teaching the public how to identify infected trees or wood and how to treat it.“There are landowners who might have ash in their forest. If we can slow the spread, it gives people more time to think about what they want to do, do some research, create a plan for their trees,” Hoffman said. “Maybe they want to do some logging and cut their healthy ash trees.”Trees with emerald ash borer larvae living in their bark can resemble partially peeled carrots — chunks of bark are stripped off. Those marks come from woodpeckers flecking away in search of grub. Other indications of infestation include splitting bark, thinning crowns and D-shaped exit holes on the trunk.If left untreated, the infestation dries out the wood and turns it brittle, useless for logging, liable to fall and ultimately dead.In Calais, townspeople’s understanding of the hazards of sick trees has made it possible to plan tree removal on a broad scale. “One of the things that strikes me about Calais is there’s a lot of interest in conservation and protection of natural resources,” said Kari Bradley, town administrator.The town’s selectboard applied for an ash tree removal grant from the Vermont Urban and Community Forestry Program, a collaboration between the state and the University of Vermont Extension. Bradley said there was no opposition from the public on the board’s unanimous decision. “Calais has close to 80 miles of road, and there are somewhere (around) 3,000 ash trees along the right of way on those roads,” Bradley said.Grant funding for the Urban and Community Forestry Program has changed due to “the shifting priorities of the current administration,” said Hoffman with a dry chuckle. “Is that a nice way of saying it?”The Trump administration’s mass campaign to cut federal awards is a cause of “angst and concern,” Hoffman said, because although the program is state funded, “a lot of the work we actually do and the service we provide to Vermonters is through federally awarded grants.”Other methods of managing the bug include injecting trees with a systemic insecticide, a process that can cost several hundred dollars every three years. It may seem pricey, but Hoffman argues that a tree could end up costing much more to take down than to vaccinate, especially if it caused damage on its way down.For several years, the state has also been releasing natural predators to the emerald ash borer: few species of wasp-like insects that lay eggs inside the borer’s larvae or eggs. It’s a biocontrol measure aimed “to try to reduce its density and to try to give the trees more of a chance,” Hoffman said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  How local Vermont towns are handling the emerald ash borer.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/emerald-ash-borer.jpg,,,2025-05-12 17:07:48.590498

Jared Polis shakes hands with state Sen.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the Colorado Voting Rights Act into law Monday, establishing various protections contained in the federal Voting Rights Act at the state level. 
Senate Bill 25-1, the first bill of the 2025 legislative session, prohibits election practices that limit the participation of people of color and other protected groups, bill sponsors said. It also includes protections for LGBTQ+ voters, expands multilingual ballot access, and requires accommodations for people with disabilities at residential facilities. 
The state attorney general could enforce voting rights under the Colorado measure, so the state does not need to rely on federal courts to enforce voting protections. The provisions of the bill would apply to all state and municipal elections. Voters whose rights are violated under the act can take action along with civil rights groups.

Bill sponsors include Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat, Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat, and Rep. Junie Joseph, a Boulder Democrat. Supporters of the bill include Colorado Common Cause, the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, the League of Women Voters and the ACLU, among other groups. 
Gonzales said inaction from Congress and decisions from federal courts have led to the “slow dismantling” of the federal Voting Rights Act. Several court decisions have weakened the federal VRA over the last decade, and there’s growing concern that President Donald Trump’s administration could try to further erode its protections. 










Those were hard fought protections that the civil rights movement and the Black community particularly fought and led to achieve, and to see the fact that now a generation later, we don't know whether or how long those protections will continue to exist — we're not just going to sit around and see what happens.


– State Sen. Julie Gonzales


“Those were hard fought protections that the civil rights movement and the Black community particularly fought and led to achieve, and to see the fact that now a generation later, we don’t know whether or how long those protections will continue to exist — we’re not just going to sit around and see what happens,” Gonzales said at a bill signing ceremony at the Governor’s Residence in Denver. “We are taking action now. We are taking action here today to ensure that every Coloradan can cast a ballot free from discrimination and free from fear.”
‘Historical weight’
Polis said the Colorado Legislature makes the first bill each session something that is particularly important and that it’s appropriate that SB-1 centers on voting rights, because “our democracy begins with voting.” 
“Voting is not something that we can take for granted. We need to make sure that we are protecting our rights as Americans to have our voices heard,” Polis said at the bill signing. “Colorado’s election system is one of the very best in the country, and with this, we’re taking steps to make sure that no matter what happens at the federal level, we can make sure to protect our voter integrity here in the great state of Colorado.”
The measure ensures incarcerated voters have the right to vote while in custody and eases access for voters who live on tribal lands in Colorado. Eligible voters in assisted living facilities will also be provided information to make it easier for them to vote. The bill also expands requirements for multilingual ballots to include municipalities in a county already required to provide multilingual ballots under requirements of a 2021 law. 
Joseph, who immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, said the Colorado Voting Rights Act has “historical weight” building on protections established in the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibited racial discrimination in voting. She said that had it not been for that measure, “I would not be before you here today.”
A January poll found that two-thirds of Coloradans support protecting voting rights at the state level, and 61% support the Colorado Voting Rights Act, while 33% oppose it. Eight states have passed their own versions, several others have considered similar measures.
Polis also signed House Bill 25-1225, which adds protections against intimidation, threats or coercion to people voting or helping others to vote.

The Daily Montanan made a few visualizations of some stats from the session — using data derived from the Legislative Services Division and the Montana Free Press, which does a great job of crafting a database of LSD data.
 More bills than ever were introduced during the 2025 session

Lawmakers come to Helena with more ideas for legislation than would ever be heard, much less end up on the Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk.
The last two sessions saw a big jump in the number of bill drafts requested by legislators — around 4,500 — up more than 1,000 from the 2021 and 2019 sessions. That has translated into back-to-back record numbers of bills actually introduced into the body — discounting the 1973-1974 sessions, the first following the adoption of the new Montana Constitution — with 39.1% of drafts receiving an official introduction this year.
The 2025 session saw 1,759 bills, resolutions and initiatives make it to at least one committee vote. In the 85 days lawmakers were in Helena, 884 bills passed both chambers. As of May 12, 570 bills have become law so far, with more than 200 awaiting action, while Gov. Greg Gianforte has already vetoed a handful.

The Montana Legislative Services Division keeps track of the passage of bills throughout the legislative process and produces visualizations to show the winnowing down of potential laws.
The below chart, taken from the LSD’s interactive “Billboard,” shows that most bills that don’t make it out of the Legislature, die in their original chambers. After that, it’s more likely the second chamber will approve a bill and it will end up heading to Gianforte’s desk. In 2025, just more than half of all bills introduced made it all the way through the process, not counting single-chamber resolutions.

In 2023, the total number of bill passed, including single-chamber resolutions, was 907. In 2025, that number jumped to 996.
 Visualizing voting statistics

Lawmakers in both chamber pressed their green or red buttons a lot of times this year — there were 2,659 votes taken in the Senate, and 2,706 in the House, according to the bill tracking data compiled by the Montana Free Press.
Of those votes, a vast majority of them were bipartisan votes, and many near-unanimous ones, which might seem odd, given that it is often highly partisan rhetoric stemming from politicians pointing fingers back and forth on myriad issues that breaks through the Capitol to the outside world.
But it’s possible to visualize the bipartisan nature of most votes, by looking at how often each lawmaker’s vote aligned with the majority of a chamber.
Take the Senate for example. The following chart shows how often each senator was on the winning side of an issue.

The lowest percentages were 66% for Democratic Sen. Andrea Olsen of Missoula and 68% for Republican Sen. Daniel Emrich of Great Falls, while 10 lawmakers were in the winning coalition more than 90% of the time.
The average Republican was in the majority 84% of the time, while the average Democrat was 78% of the time, which makes sense because the GOP held the majority in the chamber and could theoretically pass any law without any Democrat support.
Of course, that wasn’t the case, as anyone following the session closely might be aware. A major storyline from the Legislature was that the Senate chamber was effectively run by a working majority coalition of nine Republicans and all Democrats — 27 lawmakers that could pass laws on a bipartisan basis.
By plotting how often a lawmaker voted with the majority of each party, the breakout of the nine Republicans who joined Democrats in many votes is clearly visible.
Note that the axes start around 50% in order to illustrate the differences between lawmakers better.

The Nine are highlighted, and are shown clearly apart from the majority of their caucus, and dragging the “average Republican” statistic over. It’s also clear that two more Republican senators, Mike Yakawich of Billings and Mike Cuffe of Eureka, were also more likely to align with Democrats than most of their GOP members.
This chart also shows that Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, was more bipartisan that the rest of the Democrat caucus.
Another interesting statistic — Sen. Emrich, shown at the far left side of the chart, voted against Democrats more than anyone else in the Senate, but also voted against his own party more often than anyone except Sen. Russ Tempel, one of The Nine.
Of course, a reminder that these charts show general statistics, so individual votes or subject area votes can’t be inferred.
The House had a much more clear partisan divide. The following chart is a little different, plotting how often a lawmaker voted with the majority party Republicans, and how often they voted on the winning side of an issue.
The trend among Democrats — the more often a lawmaker voted with Republicans, the more likely they were to be on the winning side of an issue — is an obvious one given the Republicans’ 58-42 control of the chamber.
Among Republicans, however, the correlation between how often a representative votes with their party (96% of the time for Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe) and how often they voted on the winning side (97% for Rep. Valerie Moore) is much less clear.
The biggest outlier in the chamber is freshman lawmaker Rep. Lukas Schubert of Kalispell, who voted with his own party 4% less often than the next lawmakers, and voted on the losing side of an issue more than any Republican other than Reps. Caleb Hinkle of Belgrade and Kathy Love of Hamilton.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250212_MTLeg-566-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 17:07:48.590498

U.S. Chief District Judge […],"(Stock photo by Ivan Balvan/Getty Images)The group seeking to legalize recreational marijuana in Florida has joined a legal challenge to a newly approved crackdown on ballot initiatives.
Smart & Safe Florida over the weekend asked to intervene in a federal lawsuit filed last week by an organization seeking to place Medicaid expansion on the 2026 ballot. U.S. Chief District Judge Mark Walker granted Smart & Safe’s request on Monday. Walker, meanwhile, has set a telephonic conference on May 14 to discuss scheduling for the lawsuit and how to move forward.
Smart & Safe Florida, the group behind the proposed constitutional amendment to legalize recreational use of cannabis in 2024, is actively working to get another measure on the ballot in 2026 and didn’t respond to a request for comment.
But in a lengthy court filing, Smart & Safe Florida called the new restrictions signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis “legislative gaslighting” that is not designed to block fraud in the initiative process as contended by the governor and others but will “effectively destroy the people’s right to invoke the citizen initiative.”
The group, which has been largely financed by the medical marijuana giant Trulieve, was behind the 2024 initiative that fell just short of the 60% threshold needed to get approved. They have already started gathering petitions to try to make the 2026 ballot and have more than 200,000 signatures verified.

Smart & Safe Florida says some of the restrictions in the law, including a ban on using out-of-state residents to collect petition signatures, have already hampered their efforts. The organization has halted mailing out petition forms to registered voters due to a new requirement to turn over signed petitions within 10 days.
The law prohibits felons, noncitizens, and non-Florida residents from acting as petition circulators; requires additional personal identifying information for voters signing petition forms and for petition circulators; and includes a requirement to place a financial impact statement drawn by a state-controlled panel on petition forms. 
That financial impact statement requirement violates its First Amendment rights, Smart & Safe Florida argues.
While the Legislature, mostly the House, fought with the governor throughout the session, the Republican leadership did come together to pass HB 1205. DeSantis signed it into law three days after receiving the bill.
The new law stems from a report from the DeSantis administration that alleged fraud in the petition-gathering process.
The January report published by the state’s Office of Election Crimes and Security asserts that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting to pass the abortion-rights amendment last year committed crimes related to gathering petitions.
Meanwhile, Florida Decides Healthcare filed the the lawsuit last week. The group has been working to get its proposed constitutional amendment on expanding Medicaid on the statewide ballot in November 2026.
In a press conference last week, Florida Decides Executive Director Mitch Emerson called the law a “calculated and cowardly attempt by politicians in Tallahassee to rewrite the rules, not to serve the people, but to protect their own power. “

Last month, the four students sued Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons in federal court.
According to their lawsuit, each of the plaintiffs was admitted to the United States on an F-1 student visa. The lawsuit alleges that on April 10, 2025, ICE abruptly canceled, without explanation, the plaintiffs’ status as students within DHS’ Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems, or SEVIS, database.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A few days later, the lawsuit claims, three of the plaintiffs’ visas were revoked without explanation. The three each received identical messages from U.S. embassies, warning them that “remaining in the United States can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation.”
The lawsuit alleges that Homeland Security has initiated a national policy of “coercing international students into self-deportation by leveraging ambiguous student-status revocations, coupled with visa revocation notices and threatening language.”
On April 24, the judge in the case entered a temporary restraining order blocking Homeland Security from detaining or deporting the plaintiffs. The judge is still considering a motion to convert that order to a longer-lasting preliminary injunction.
Late last week, lawyers for Homeland Security submitted to the court a sworn statement from James Hicks, a division chief for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program within ICE.
In his statement, Hicks said the SEVIS database has restored the plaintiffs’ status as students to “active” in keeping with the court’s temporary restraining order. Hicks said that while outsiders can’t see it, there is a new notation added in each student’s electronic record indicating their active status was restored retroactively to the original date of termination.
Lawyers for the students, however, appear to be less than satisfied by Hicks’ assurances.
“Defendants have not backdated the restoration of plaintiffs’ SEVIS status in a manner visible to designated school officers and other immigration agencies,” they responded in a court filing. They noted that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — which is a different entity from the similarly named Immigration and Customs Enforcement — “may deny a benefit based on a student’s failure to maintain status, and the Department of State, which could deny or revoke a visa at any time, including for failure to maintain status.”
Unless the students’ SEVIS record is modified in a way that is visible to all end-users of the system, Homeland Security and ICE are out of compliance with the court’s temporary restraining order, attorneys for the students argue.
Homeland Security’s promise that it will not attempt again to terminate the four individuals’ status as students provides little protection, they add, pointing to a new policy at ICE and the agency’s limited promise that it won’t try again to terminate the UI students’ status in a manner that’s “based solely” on the criminal record check that triggered the initial attempt.
On April 26, 2025, they point out, ICE implemented a new policy introducing two new grounds for student termination — visa revocation and failure to maintain status – that could now be applied to the four UI students.
ICE and Homeland Security, the students’ lawyers have told the court, “have given no assurance that they will not terminate on these grounds.” The two federal agencies, they add, are “staying notably silent on their new, unlawful grounds for termination.”
The students’ lawyers cite ICE’s shifting policies as further evidence of the need for a preliminary injunction in the case.
The four plaintiffs in the case are Sri Chaitanya Krishna Akondy, an Indian national now working for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services; Prasoon Kumar, an Indian national and chemical engineering student; Songli Cai, a Chinese national and third-year undergraduate student; and Haoran Yang, a Chinese national and third-year undergraduate and pre-doctorate student.

Jim Kasper, R-Fargo, speaks on the House floor on April 1, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Rep. Jim Kasper, R-Fargo, returned to Fargo on May 8 to continue his recovery after being hospitalized during the closing days of the legislative session.
In a Monday news release, Republican District 46 Chair Rob Muntz said Kasper suffered a brain bleed on April 23 and was transported to CHI-St. Alexius Medical Center in Bismarck, where he stayed until Thursday.
Muntz said Kasper will continue his rehab at the PAM Health Rehabilitation Hospital in south Fargo.
“Jim is ready to work hard to get better. He is getting stronger day by day,” said Sandy Kasper, Kasper’s wife, in a statement. “He has a long way to go, but we are starting to see signs of the old Jim.”
After his rehabilitative care is completed, Muntz said Kasper will return to his home in south Fargo. No timeline has been set for his return home.
Kasper has served in the North Dakota House of Representatives since 2001. Over his five terms in office, he has sponsored more than 400 bills, which included House Bill 1584 during the 2025 legislative session that provides licensure and regulatory requirements for pharmacy benefit managers.
Also during the 2025 session, Kasper was the primary sponsor on House Bill 1303 that prohibits sanctuary city policies in North Dakota and House Bill 1602, which allows local subdivisions to not participate in the Public Employees Retirement System’s defined contribution plan.
All three of those bills, among others he sponsored and co-sponsored, were signed into law by Gov. Kelly Armstrong.

Thirteen U.S. military members were killed in the chaotic withdrawal at the Kabul airport.About 80,000 Afghans came to the U.S. and settled in various programs that offered legal protections and work authorization. Of that group, 9,000 were designated TPS.TPS is granted to nationals whose home country is deemed too dangerous to return due to violence or disasters.The TPS designation for Afghanistan will expire on May 20 and deportation protections will lift on July 12. The order is likely to face legal challenges, since Noem’s moves to curtail TPS for other nationals have faced lawsuits.“This administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent,” Noem said in a statement. “We’ve reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation. Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent(s) them from returning to their home country.”The termination of the status comes as the Trump administration fast-tracked the classification of refugees for white South Africans who landed in the U.S. Monday at Dulles International Airport in Virginia.President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February that noted Afrikaners — an ethnic group in South Africa made up of European descendants, predominantly Dutch — are “victims of unjust racial discrimination” after South Africa’s government passed a land ownership law in an effort to address land dispossession that occurred under apartheid.The Trump administration suspended all refugee services in late January and has resisted a district court's order to reinstate the program, along with contracts to organizations that facilitate refugee resettlement services.Noem said that determination to end TPS for Afghanistan was based on a review from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Afghanistan's conditions along with input from the State Department.The Taliban currently control the government and the State Department’s travel advisory for the country is the highest level, a 4, which means it advises against traveling.DHS added in a statement that Noem “further determined that permitting Afghan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the national interest of the United States.”Noem has also ended TPS for Venezuelans and Haitians.The Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court in early May to lift a lower court’s order that reversed Noem's decision to end TPS for one group of Venezuelans.",,,,2025-05-12 17:07:48.590498

According to a report from Reuters, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory body created through an executive order, has prompted the firing, severance and early retirement of more than 260,000 government employees. However, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking efforts to restructure the federal government. 
In March, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his own DOGE-related cuts, aiming to terminate 20,000 full time employees and reorganize the department’s 28 divisions to 15. The department has also closed its regional offices in Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, halving its total regional facilities.

However, a coalition of 20 attorneys general, including Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, have taken legal action against Kennedy and several department officials, arguing these cuts would functionally dismantle the DHHS. 
If the court doesn’t provide immediate relief, and the case is allowed to play out, Nessel warned that these cuts could cause “immeasurable harm” to the nation and its health system. 
“You’re essentially leaving the agency, as a whole, completely dysfunctional by eliminating so many departments or regions, you know entire offices just wiped off the map and, of course, getting rid of some people with some incredible expertise,” Nessel told the Michigan Advance
The DHHS is eliminating roughly 3,500 employees at the Food and Drug Administration, 2,400 at the Centers for Disease Control, 1,200 at the National Institutes of Health and 300 at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
It will also work to consolidate the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health under the new Administration for a Healthy America. 
Public health and infectious diseases know no borders, Nessel said, warning that the decision to shutter regional health programs, close CDC labs and close all 10 of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services’ regional offices jeopardizes public health in every community. 
“Also it’s just a flagrant violation of the law. Disregards the separation of powers, and it places this new burden now, of course, on the states, because there are certain things that you rely upon the federal government to do, especially in terms of coordinating efforts between the states,” Nessel said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Let’s say you have an outbreak of a new variant in bird flu that could impact the entire country. Maybe that happens in Vermont. Is Vermont supposed to coordinate that response with Michigan? You know, it’s the CDC that does that. How are we supposed to make up for that?” Nessel questioned. 
While the state has its own lab testing capabilities, the federal government and its labs act as a conduit for sharing data with the states and across the nation, as well as monitoring other countries. 
“They fill this incredibly important role in terms of preventing the next global pandemic and mitigating it here in Michigan. And it’s a burden that, frankly, the state simply can’t sustain. It’s the reason why we have a federal government,” Nessel said. 
Additionally, it’s the federal government’s job to ensure its laws are enforced, Nessel said, and Congress delegates money to ensure those laws are complied with. Deciding to withhold those funds and cut staffing without regard for which workers are essential, and shutting down offices without regard for whether the department can continue to comply with federal law not only violates the law and the Constitution in a myriad of ways, Nessel contends, but it compromises the safety and health of people in Michigan. 
While Kennedy said the intent of the cuts was to address waste and inefficiency within the department, Nessel said the argument doesn’t hold water due to the way the DHHS approached its firings. 
“It’s not as if it took any significant period of time to evaluate, you know, is this really a necessary function of the government, and do we really need this to fulfill the mission of this agency? There were no determinations of any kind made like that” Nessel said, pointing to comments Kennedy made to the media where he admitted 20% of cuts at the agency were a mistake, and would need to be reinstated. 
He also admitted he had forgone a line-by-line review of each employee’s jobs because “it takes too long, and you lose political momentum.”
Among those cuts were doctors and the administrator of the World Trade Center Health program, which certify illnesses in first responders and survivors of the 9/11 terrorist attacks as part of the requirements of the Zadroga Act, with the New York Daily News reporting nearly all 16 employees cut from the program had been rehired as of May 7, including the program’s director, James Howard. 
“If you were more careful and cautious before you fired them in the first place, maybe we wouldn’t have this issue,” Nessel said. 
The case filed by the attorneys general points to several other examples of offices impacted by the cuts, including the Food and Drug Administration missing a vaccine application deadline and canceling a critical test for the bird flu virus, suspending the testing program for a year. 
The case also points to Kennedy’s anti-vaccine views and history of promoting misinformation about vaccination. 
According to the filing, some FDA employees were told to go home following the March 27 downsizing announcement and prepare for the possibility that they would not be back. If they received a termination email, they would lose access to the building.

“Beginning in the early morning of April 1, 2025, HHS employees in all offices, administrations, agencies and sub-agencies began to receive termination notices. Some employees had not seen their early morning termination email before leaving for the office, and were surprised when they arrived at work to find their access cards had been deactivated,” the case reads. 
“Many notices contained errors. For example, some listed incorrect information about workers’ recent performance ratings. At FDA, the listed point of contact for the Equal Employment Opportunity office had departed a month earlier,” it says. 
While this case doesn’t directly address that lack of support and protection for employees, several unions and groups of federal employees have taken legal action on these concerns. 
“It’s embarrassing and disturbing to see any workers treated like this, but especially, you know, ones that have worked so hard to protect the American people,” Nessel said.
She also pointed to the ways these firings would impact the economy, calling them “penny wise but pound foolish.”
In the announcement, Kennedy promised to lower costs for taxpayers, with the 10,000 person layoff expected to cut down on $1.8 billion a year. However, Nessel said these costs would crop up in other ways.
“What has a bigger impact on the economy than people’s health, you know? If people are too sick to be able to work, that’s a problem,” Nessel said, noting that widespread infectious disease can have a devastating impact on the economy. 
“It’s not just that we’re not really saving money. We’re going to lose an unknown amount of money, an untold amount of money, if people who could otherwise have been healthy are not healthy,” Nessel said. 
While Michigan is still assembling its state-specific declarations, these firings will also impact the state’s efforts on issues like mental health and create issues in how they distribute resources within their budgets, Nessel said. 
“If we’re trying to prioritize and say, ‘Well, how much money are we going to spend on substance abuse, or how much money are we going to spend on mental health treatment?’ It’s kind of important to know how much of it you’re going to get from the federal government. And because this is done in such a chaotic manner, it’s really hard to know,” Nessel said.
In addition to their case on the mass firings, Nessel and 23 other attorneys general filed suit against Kennedy and the DHHS for terminating almost $11 billion in critical public health grants across the country.

Cooperative Extension) The Farm Service Agency has closed two local offices and cut five staff in the region, state official says. North Carolina is looking for ways to fill the gaps.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has just one staffer providing guidance for farmers’ disaster loans across 23 North Carolina counties, a state official said Monday.
USDA’s Farm Service Agency is charged with distributing aid after storms like Hurricane Helene wipe out crops. But Emily Gangi, chief deputy for the governor’s Helene recovery office, said they now had a threadbare presence in the region after the White House made cuts.
“You heard me right,” Gangi said. “One loan officer for 23 counties.”
The agency has closed two local offices, according to Gangi, and cut five staff. And there’s currently a hiring freeze in place.
USDA’s skeletal staffing could further complicate the flow of federal money to farmers and ranchers in the mountains. The Farm Service Agency oversees an array of disaster loan programs, several of which have deadlines and sign-ups in the coming months.
North Carolina has submitted a proposal to receive more than half a billion dollars from USDA through a block grant program. And local governments have until the end of the month to apply for money to clear debris and repair drainage infrastructure. Over the summer and early fall, applications will open for other programs dealing with commodities and livestock loss.
Gangi said her team was exploring options for the state to help “if the federal government is not going to staff these programs.”
“Our farmers need more attention and more support,” she said.
Ronald Garrett, who was appointed earlier this month as North Carolina’s state director for the Farm Service Agency, did not answer a call Monday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
The FSA cuts are another obstacle for state officials looking to send as much federal money westward as quickly as possible. A key office within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that handles disaster recovery has reportedly prepared to cut most of its staff. And new leadership at FEMA, an agency the president has mused about abolishing, has reduced the cost-share between the federal government and state.
North Carolina lawmakers have also set out money for a state crop loss program. Applications were set to close May 4 but will remain open for another week. Matt Calabria, who leads the governor’s Helene recovery office, said there had been fewer applications from western farmers than anticipated.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-extension-helene.jpg,,,2025-05-12 16:07:20.574881

Photo by Jennifer Hauck/Valley NewsThis story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on May 11.WOODSTOCK— Village trustees concluded that evidence of the town police chief’s lack of leadership was so “damning” that they were left with no choice but to uphold the municipal manager’s decision to demote him to the entry-level rank he held when joining the force as a rookie 25 years ago.A 47-page “Findings of Fact” report details numerous personnel issues involving Woodstock Police Chief Joe Swanson that led Municipal Manager Eric Duffy to determine — and the five Village trustees to uphold — that morale had suffered so significantly under Swanson’s leadership that he could no longer lead the department.Swanson, who following a paid administrative leave has been back at work as a patrol officer since April 24, filed dual court motions in the wake of the trustees’ public release of their April 17 decision.The first motion seeks a preliminary injunction to block the town from hiring a new police chief and a new sergeant — the latter who is currently filling in as interim chief — until the court rules on the merits of the second motion, which seeks to reverse the town’s decision to demote Swanson.Under Vermont law, Swanson had 30 days to file an appeal of the trustees’ decision.“We’re taking two separate tracks here for the pursuit of justice,” Linda Fraas, Swanson’s attorney explained to the Valley News about the succession of multiple court petitions.“The first one is that Joe really wants his job back. The second one is because Joe’s reputation has been damaged irreparably by the actions of the town and the only way that can be recovered is through a civil lawsuit.”The latest legal salvos follow a civil lawsuit Swanson filed earlier this month in Windsor County Superior Court seeking $5 million in punitive damages, alleging that he was unlawfully ousted from his job and “maliciously maligned” by town officials whom, he suggested in court documents, treat heterosexual employees differently in disciplinary matters.READ MORE





 


Woodstock police chief tries to hold on to his job as municipal manager seeks demotion 

by Valley News 
March 21, 2025, 4:19 pmMarch 21, 2025, 4:27 pm 



The lawsuit alleges that the trustees had no legal basis to demote the police chief under his contract with the town and lobs back counterexamples of alleged conflicts of interest, favoritism, secret dealings and ethical lapses by some trustees as they sought to push Swanson out of his job.The “Findings of Fact,” which the trustees initially balked at publicly releasing, incorporates many of the same complaints testified by Woodstock Police Department employees during a March public hearing held before the trustees at Swanson’s request to challenge Duffy’s decision to bump him down to the lowest rank on the department’s ladder.Trustees Chair Seton McIlroy said via email to the Valley News that although she couldn’t speak for the other members of the Board, “I chose to vote ‘yes’ because I believe it’s appropriate under the circumstances.”(Regardless, the Board’s 4-0 vote of reversal — one trustee was absent — to release the document publicly was rendered moot when Swanson’s attorney attached it as an exhibit to the preliminary injunction motion).Over the course of 14-plus hours of hearings, several members of the police department, including Sgt. Chris O’Keefe, the department’s No. 2 and currently interim chief, described incidents of Swanson’s loose management style, which in their view contributed to tension and low morale among department personnel during his 15 months as police chief.Police department employees testified that Swanson frequently had “unnotified absences” from work, did not adhere to the hours as specified in his contract, could be hard to reach, failed to respond to investigatory matters in a timely or thorough fashion, was inconsistent or unresponsive in exercising discipline, could be dismissive of coworkers’ concerns, reported for duty out of full uniform, and kept a “messy” office, among other complaints and infractions.Dissatisfaction reached a boiling point earlier this year when both of the police department’s employee bargaining units — each of which has only a handful of members — issued “no confidence” votes against Swanson and asked Duffy, the municipal manager, to find a new police chief.The chief’s work habits, style and inconsistent communication with the five-officer police force, dispatchers and administrative staff led to low morale within the department, the trustees wrote in their “Findings” report — even though, they noted, Duffy had given Swanson a largely positive review in his first performance evaluation.(Duffy said he only became aware of discontent within the department following Swanson’s performance review).Swanson — who did not dispute his office was messy — has countered that the complaints were distorted, taken out of context or misinterpreted reactions to things he said. He has said he considered department morale to be overall “high, at least on most occasions,” despite “some ripples and bumps.”He also presented evidence that he responded to more than 900 off-hour dispatcher calls during his 15 months as police chief, including on weekends, holidays and vacation.But, based on testimony from Duffy and police department personnel given during the March hearing and after reviewing documents submitted from attorneys for both sides, the trustees concurred that the municipal manager had made the right call.Duffy’s “decision to demote Swanson was based not on one particular violation,” they wrote in the “Findings” report. “Rather, (Duffy) based his decision on the totality of complaints and the combined evidence regarding Swanson’s conduct and performance as police chief.”The municipal manager “believes the chief of police must be an ambassador to the community and must provide leadership, direction of Police Department strategies and related policies, training (and) supervision of employees, and discipline where warranted and … must be able to build relationships in the community and with employees,” the report said.Ultimately, the trustees concluded, Swanson “did not meet Duffy’s expectations that he function as a role model while serving as chief of police.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Woodstock trustees’ report says former police chief failed to serve as town ‘role model’.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/woodstock-joe-swanson.jpg,,,2025-05-12 16:07:20.574881

(Photo courtesy of University of West Florida)University of West Florida President Martha Saunders will resign months ahead of the expiration of her contract on Dec. 31, she announced Monday morning. She has served as president since 2017. 
The resignation came after Gov. Ron DeSantis made clear his intention to overhaul the Pensacola university, including controversial trustee appointments and criticisms of university research and student activities. 
“In accordance with the terms of my contract, and after thoughtful reflection, I have made the decision to conclude my presidency,” Saunders wrote in a letter to the university community. “This was not an easy choice. I know it may come as a surprise, and for some, a disappointment. Please know I did not make it lightly. I believe this is the right time — for me and for UWF.”
DeSantis (and Board of Governors) appointees to the UWF Board of Trustees caused a stir this legislative session, with one rejected by the Senate and two others resigning before the Senate could vote on their confirmation. 
DeSantis said last month there are “big changes” in store for UWF while bragging about the political overhaul of New College of Florida.
DeSantis said UWF has some of the “most liberal programs in the state” and that Florida will not tolerate “indoctrination camps” during an April 15 news conference about Hope Florida in Pensacola. “Buckle up,” DeSantis said to UWF.
UWF stakeholders and some senators have questioned how liberal the university could be, considering the significantly higher number of registered Republicans than Democrats in the counties the school primarily serves.
Senators asked the UWF trustees during April confirmation hearings if they thought major changes were needed in regards to administrative or political problems at the university. Most said they weren’t aware of any major changes that needed to be made, the Phoenix reported.

Trustee concerns
Since DeSantis’ “big changes” comment, he appointed Zack Smith, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, to the UWF board last week. DeSantis appointed Smith to the Pensacola State College board in February, too. 
Days after his appointment, Smith, a Pensacola local, described a “pattern of problematic actions” at the university under Saunders’ presidency.
During a UWF trustee meeting Thursday, Smith questioned Saunders about university actions he found “deeply troubling.”
A student-organized drag show presented in partnership with the university’s office of equity and diversity in 2019 and UWF libraries recommending reading “How to be an Anti-Racist” by Ibram X. Kendi in 2023 were among actions Smith took exception to. 
Smith said he was not fully satisfied with Saunders’ responses to his questions about those topics. 
Smith was asked by WEAR News on Saturday if the goal of the board was to oust Saunders. He did not directly answer the question; instead, he said the duty of the board is to do what is best for students. 
“Over the past several years, we’ve accomplished extraordinary things together: record enrollments, historic fundraising, national recognition, and a campus culture that puts students first,” Saunders wrote. “We’ve met challenges head-on and kept our values intact. I could not be more proud of what we’ve built.”
Her letter does not mention a leave date. “I will work closely with the Board of Trustees and the campus leadership to ensure a smooth transition. My commitment to this University and its people remains strong through my final day in office — and beyond,” she wrote.
Senators responded to public pushback against trustee appointments Gates Garcia, Adam Kissel, and Scott Yenor. Those appointees, and five others, were part of DeSantis’ (and the Board of Governors’) push to change UWF.
Yenor, a political science professor from Idaho, director at the Claremont Institute, and a Heritage Foundation writer, was elected chair of the board earlier this year but resigned following an uproar in the UWF community. He has a history of controversial comments about women and the LGBTQ community.
Other newly appointed trustees voted for Yenor to be chair, and senators asked them to defend that vote while considering their confirmations.
Garcia, a Tampa resident, resigned after facing the curious senators and Kissel was rejected, with senators citing their desire for more local members on the board. Sen. Gayle Harrell said the Senate is “closely watching” the UWF board.
Officials in the DeSantis administration raised concern over a UWF research grant they called a “social justice grant.”
According to DeSantis communications director Bryan Griffin, on X, the grant was eliminated as part of the Florida DOGE initiative.
The $800,000 grant from the National Science Foundation was called Educating Science and Mathematics Majors to Teach with Social Justice Models in High-Needs Schools. The university said it has used about 25% of the grant, WUWF reported.
The university said social justice was not incorporated in the program despite the title of the grant. The grant had been funding a water quality sampling study, the university said.
Saunders’ contract base salary is $536,273 and up to a 20% performance bonus. Her contract requires 90 days written notice to resign, although the board can waive that wait period.
Saunders may return to her job as a tenured professor, according to her contract. 
DeSantis’ office did not respond to a request for comment Monday afternoon.

Randy Feenstra filed paperwork Monday to launch a bid for governor, the first high-profile Republican to do so in the open GOP primary field.
Feenstra filed the paperwork for “Feenstra for Governor” with the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board Monday, a needed step to launch a gubernatorial campaign. It came hours after Iowa Auditor Rob Sand, a Democrat, filed the same report for his campaign for governor, which he  announced earlier Monday.
The GOP congressman, representing Iowa’s 4th Congressional District in the U.S. House, has not officially announced his campaign, and a spokesperson for Feenstra did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the bid. But the filing means he has entered a potentially large field of Republicans vying to become the party’s nominee in the wake of Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she will not seek reelection in 2026.

Former state Rep. Brad Sherman is the only Republican to have officially launched his campaign for governor, which he announced in February before Reynolds had exited the race. But alongside Feenstra, others are expected to join the race — state Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, launched an exploratory committee for the governor’s race in April. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and House Speaker Pat Grassley have also said they are considering a run for the governor’s seat in 2026, but have not officially made any decisions on running.
Feenstra is the only member of Iowa’s all-Republican House delegation to say he was considering a run — U.S. Reps. Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn all said they do not plan to run for the position. He had told reporters at an April Marshalltown event that it was a “fair statement” to say he was keeping his options open on a gubernatorial campaign, according to the Des Moines Register.
The 4th District, representing much of northwest Iowa, is considered a conservative stronghold in the state. Feenstra has represented the district in Congress since the 2020 election, when he beat former U.S. Rep. Steve King in the Republican primary. He served as a state senator from 2009 until his election to federal office, and as Sioux County treasurer from 2006 to 2008.
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart released a statement Monday criticizing Feenstra following the filing for a gubernatorial campaign.
“Whether in Washington or Des Moines, Congressman Randy Feenstra has been a reliable foot soldier for the misguided partisans and insiders ruining our state,” Hart said. “Meanwhile, Iowa is now 49th in economic growth and losing manufacturing jobs while Rep. Feenstra has failed to deliver a farm bill, voted to gut Medicaid, and supported Iowa’s unaccountable voucher program that’s jeopardizing Iowa’s fiscal budget. We need a new direction and Randy Feenstra is just more of the same failed leadership.”

(Photo by Jacob Fischler/States Newsroom)OKLAHOMA CITY – Gov. Kevin Stitt accused lawmakers of acting “bananas” and wrote over the weekend that they needed to stop “monkeying around” and pass tax cuts.
The Republican, who has ramped up his calls for income tax cuts in recent days, appeared to try to poke fun at lawmakers as he vetoed legislation creating a special license plate benefitting the Oklahoma City Zoo.
He also on Saturday signed a number of measures, including one that could ban some drag shows.
Senate Bill 837 would have allowed Service Oklahoma to enter an agreement with the Oklahoma Zoological Society to use its logo. The Oklahoma Zoological Society, a nonprofit which supports the Oklahoma City Zoo, to receive not more than $20 for each plate sold. 
The measure, which also created a motorcycle plate for Tulsa’s Greenwood Historical District and allowed $27 of the fee paid for the plate to go to the Tulsa Juneteenth Festival, was one of seven bills he vetoed on Saturday.
“It’s bananas that our Legislature has time to dedicate to creating more novelty license plates but doesn’t have the time to pass tax cuts,” Stitt’s veto message said. “The Legislature should stop monkeying around and address the elephant in the room. It is time to boa (sic) up and pass tax cuts.”
Oklahoma has over 200 specialty license plate options ranging from those that honor the military to those supporting various colleges, occupations, groups and causes. One of those is for the Tulsa Zoo.
“The Legislature’s overzealous commitment to vanity license plates has resulted in a bloated catalogue full of taxpayer funded advertisements for special interest groups,” Stitt wrote.
Stitt has been pushing lawmakers to reduce the state’s 4.75% income tax rate and find a way toward elimination.
In the past week, he’s posted social media videos praising 17 state senators, who he said support cutting taxes, and of school-aged children, being urged on by an adult, chanting “tax cut, tax cut” on his official Facebook page. 
Stitt used social media to explain why he had signed other measures, including House Bill 1217, calling it a “no brainer.”
“We are basically banning drag shows in front of kids,” Stitt said.
House Bill 1217 makes it a crime to engage in adult performances that have obscenity, or permit them, on public property where a minor could view them.
“Go check out and see who voted against that bill,” Stit said. “Crazy.”
Critics said the measure is unconstitutional.

Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerVermont’s Roman Catholic Diocese, now seeking to reorganize its depleting finances in U.S. Bankruptcy Court after settling 67 priest misconduct lawsuits, is bracing for a new wave of child sex abuse claims.The state’s largest religious denomination paid out $34.5 million to survivors in the two decades between when news of a nationwide scandal broke in 2002 and its filing for Chapter 11 protection last fall.As part of the bankruptcy process, all pending and future lawsuits have been placed on hold, with Judge Heather Cooper inviting accusers who haven’t reported abuse before to join the case as potential creditors.As a result, 118 people have submitted confidential claims, records show — almost double the number of previously settled lawsuits.The bankruptcy court doesn’t have the authority to hold hearings on any of the allegations, which are sealed from the public and the press. Instead, the judge has scheduled a non-evidentiary “presentation of survivor statements” for Wednesday at 10 a.m. at Burlington’s Federal Building.READ MORE
“For many survivors, it took years and a lot of courage to come forward, so when the diocese filed for bankruptcy, it robbed those survivors of their opportunity to stand in front of a jury of their peers,” said Brittany Michael, a lawyer for a federally appointed committee representing creditors with abuse claims. “We know that the opportunity to speak in court can be an important part of the healing journey,” Michael said. “The survivors’ statements are a way to at least tell their story.”The diocese, facing allegations of priest misconduct dating as far back as 1950, is the nation’s 40th Catholic entity to seek bankruptcy protection, it notes on an explainer page on its website.Under federal law, the diocese must present the court with a tally of its financial assets and liabilities and petition for Chapter 11 help. The judge, in turn, will decide whether to allow church leaders to develop a reorganization plan that would require approval from both the court and creditors.Seeking “full disclosure and transparency,” abuse claimants are seeking church records detailing not only a reported $35 million tied to the diocese’s headquarters and its state-level holdings but also all the community operations it oversees, starting with 63 parishes with an estimated collective worth of $500 million.The resulting findings are expected to spark future debate on whether abuse claimants and other creditors will be limited to compensation from the church’s headquarters or also could be reimbursed through local assets.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s Roman Catholic Diocese faces 118 more clergy misconduct claims.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VTD-Catholic-18-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 16:07:20.574881

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature’s auditors reported Monday the state Department of Commerce didn’t consistently adhere to internal evaluation processes and maintain transparency in selecting recipients of $99 million in federal infrastructure and economic development funding.
Kristen Rottinghaus, deputy auditor of the Kansas Division of Post Audit, said the review raised questions about the commerce department’s compliance in early 2022 with its method of scoring the 250 qualifying applications and the authority wielded by Secretary David Toland to include his personal analysis of applications in wake of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.
Eligible applications were to be scored by two state agency staff members, but in some instances only one score existed or reviewers left certain questions on scoring sheets blank. Absence of that information could have disadvantaged applicants, the audit report said.
“We think these inconsistencies are important,” said Rottinghaus, who said auditors took a deep dive into 10 applicants.
The Department of Commerce hired a private company to perform initial screening of 455 applications submitted by cities, counties, colleges and universities, businesses and nonprofits. The idea was to inject funding into upgrading business parks, improving health care facilities, modernizing infrastructure as well as invest in other development initiatives.
Applications came from 84 of the state’s 105 counties and sought a total of $1.7 billion. About 200 were discounted because they didn’t meet minimum requirements. The commerce department deployed a scoring rubric and subjective assessments tied to geography, project type and need to narrow the list to 35 projects in 24 counties.
Awards ranged from $13,500 to $10 million, but two counties in Kansas won 29% of the projects and 49% of available money.
Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, received six awards for $33 million. The second-biggest recipient was Butler County with four projects valued at $15.5 million. The population of Butler County ranks 8th among counties in Kansas. The county is represented by Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican contemplating a Republican campaign for governor in 2026.
Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, said the Department of Commerce devoted a lot of time to the application scoring system but he alleged Toland “sort of ignored it.” Toland, who serves as commerce secretary and as lieutenant governor in Kansas, is among potential Democratic candidates for governor.
“Was the scoring system more for appearance or just to give cover for the secretary to decide whoever he wanted to give the money to?” said Thompson, who also questioned whether some projects receiving funding were a higher priority than proposals rejected.
“It seems like it was just willy-nilly granting money,” he said. “It just seems like this was rushed and not well-though-out.”
The grant program, known as Building a Strong Economy or BASE, was established by the so-called SPARK executive committee that included Toland, Masterson, then-House Speaker Ron Ryckman and several appointees of state government officials. SPARK was authorized by Senate Bill 159, which was passed in spring 2021 to handle allocation of an avalanche of federal relief funding.
In terms of the Kansas award recipients, 16 of 35 projects received at least 90% of the amount requested. Eleven of 35 projects secured less than half the request. Twenty of 24 recipient counties had a single project. In addition to multiple grants secured by Johnson and Butler counties, Shawnee County received three grants and Wyandotte County was awarded two grants.
Rachel Willis, director of legislative affairs at the Department of Commerce, said the agency rapidly carried out the grant process in response to a global pandemic that wreaked havoc on the Kansas economy.
“The BASE program has successfully provided funding to support key infrastructure development projects across the state to help expand the state’s base of businesses and residents,” she said. “This was a challenging task given the significant number of applications received and the importance of getting the money into the communities quickly.”
Willis said the Department of Commerce was committed to geographic distribution when making the final grant awards, which meant not all projects receiving the highest technical score could be funded.
“If we only evaluated strictly on technical scores, only a couple regions of the state would have received nearly all the grants, leaving the state’s other regions with nothing,” she said.
Willis said the commerce secretary had authority under state law to evaluate applications “using a broader scope and breadth of factors,” including whether the applicant was in a rural, suburban or urban setting. Toland also took into account diversification in the types of project, potential impact a project would have on the community and how the project aligned with the state’s strategic economic development plans, she said.
The audit report, however, said public transparency was compromised by failure of the Department of Commerce to document Toland’s process of making final decisions on grant awards.
Willis acknowledged human error found its way into documentation of the selection process, but noted the audit “confirmed there was no wrongdoing in the selection process by the agency.”
Rep. Sean Tarwater, R-Stilwell, pressed the state auditor on this point, asker Rottinghaus directly whether the review uncovered fraud.
“This was just assessing their process,” she said. “We can’t speak to any fraud.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rottinghaus-of-legislative-post-audit-1024x450.png,,,2025-05-12 16:07:20.574881

(Photo by 10'000 Hours/ Getty Images)The federal government has terminated $35 million of funding that would have provided digital skills and online safety for rural Mainers, veterans and low-income residents. 
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration told the Maine Connectivity Authority, the agency leading broadband expansion in the state, that it was terminating three grants as of Friday. According to a news release from the state agency, the grants funded programs that would have served nearly 130,000 people by helping improve digital skills, provide internet safety education and ensure people have affordable devices. 
Maine Connectivity Authority (MCA) has been preparing to use these funds since 2022 through the creation of the state’s Digital Equity Plan. They came from the bipartisan Digital Equity Act of 2021 that President Donald Trump called “racist” and “totally unconstitutional” the day before MCA received the termination notice. 
“This announcement is deeply disappointing, and MCA is exploring Maine’s options to respond to the legality of the grant termination,” said President Andrew Butcher.
Maine wasn’t alone with these cuts, with grant terminations nationwide, the release said. 
The agency conducted a statewide survey in 2023 that showed more than nine in 10 people are worried about staying safe online and don’t feel they have the tools to protect themselves and their families. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found more than 2,000 people in Maine fell victim to internet crimes that year, costing more than $31 million.
The three affected grants include $10 million to fund a statewide device donation and refurbishment campaign, as well as another $11 million for the Greater Portland Council of Governments to provide digital services for municipal governments, device programs, digital skills education, business support programs and more. 
“These programs are not abstract policy initiatives — they are lifelines for thousands of Maine residents who depend on digital access for education, healthcare, employment and basic communication,” said Kristina Egan, executive director of the Greater Portland Council of Governments.
The remaining $13.8 million was supposed to help the National Digital Equity Center partner with over a dozen community organizations throughout the state to provide digital skills, technical support, telehealth access and affordable device programs.
While the cuts could disproportionally affect older Mainers, small businesses, students, veterans and low-income residents, the programs affected are separate from the state and federally funded broadband infrastructure grants.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)For the second time in as many years, South Dakota Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds has formally asked the federal Department of the Interior to establish a tribal law enforcement training center in his home state.
This year’s request took the form of a letter from Rounds to Doug Burgum, who served as North Dakota’s governor before ascending to the role of Interior secretary for the Trump administration.
Rounds and U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota agitated for a regional Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement training center last year. Johnson had previously pushed for field hearings that would bring members of Congress to tribal areas to learn the challenges of policing them.
Tribes seek youth police academy to fill open jobs

Their advocacy last year dovetailed with the controversy sparked by comments from former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem Noem, who’s now secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. She said Native American reservations in South Dakota were overrun by Mexican drug cartel members and that some tribal leaders were benefiting from it. She also said that unemployment and absent parents had left Native American children bereft of hope.
Leaders of all nine tribes in the state voted to ban her from their lands in the months that followed. Some have since rescinded the bans.
Noem, who said a lack of tribal law enforcement exacerbates public safety problems, worked with Attorney General Marty Jackley to sponsor an additional state-level basic law enforcement training academy session last summer that gave priority to Native American recruits.
Typically, potential Native American officers from South Dakota attend 12 weeks of basic law enforcement training in Artesia, New Mexico — 1,000 miles or more from home.
The 11 recruits trained in Pierre last year were able to get their certification to work in policing in South Dakota, but were also given the chance to remotely complete an additional BIA training module called the Bridge Training Program that would typically take place in New Mexico.
As Noem sparred with tribes rhetorically and pushed to train more tribal officers in South Dakota’s state training academy, the congressional delegation pushed the BIA to establish a regional training center in Pierre.
Such a center, they argued, would allow potential Native American police officers to train during the week and return home to their families on weekends.
Rounds reiterated that point in Monday’s letter to Burgum.
“Many tribal law enforcement leaders believe that the distance to the New Mexico facility is a barrier to recruitment,” Rounds wrote.
He suggested that an existing training center could serve as a satellite training location for tribal policing, and pointed to last summer’s training in Pierre as an “encouraging” sign that such a setup can work.

(Photo by Shaun Griswold / Source NM)As the U.S. government considers cutting funding for the nation’s most prominent food benefits program, advocates in New Mexico recommend the state government step in to protect and expand it.
Nonprofit child advocacy organization New Mexico Voices for Children on Friday released a report outlining five recommendations for New Mexico to improve its Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps.
The U.S. House Committee on Agriculture is expected on Tuesday to hold a “markup” hearing to discuss how Republicans plan to cut federal funding for SNAP.

The report, written by NM Voices Senior Research and Policy Analyst Emily Wildau, notes that while the U.S. Department of Agriculture administers SNAP, state governments manage applications, certify households and issue monthly benefits to participants’ Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards.
The proposed Republican cuts to SNAP, Medicaid and other programs “will mean less food assistance for families and lead directly to higher costs for groceries, increased hunger, and significant harm for both local economies and state spending priorities over time,” the report continues.
In New Mexico, one quarter the population receives SNAP benefits, the highest rate of any state in the U.S., according to the report, and out of all SNAP recipients in New Mexico, 38% are children and 62% are working. Overall, between 2015 and 2019, SNAP lifted an average of 60,000 New Mexicans, including 25,000 children, above the poverty line each yea,
“It is critical that advocates work to protect SNAP benefits and enact important reforms at the state level that can counter these federal attacks,” the report states.
Wildau’s report contains five recommendations on how the state of New Mexico should support the SNAP program. First among them: codify the state’s SNAP Outreach Plan into state law, which would require the state Health Care Authority to submit an annual outreach plan to the federal government.
This would allow nonprofits working with the state government to use federal matching funds to distribute food to SNAP recipients, the report says.

Both chambers of the New Mexico Legislature unanimously passed this proposal in the most recent legislative session but Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed it.
The governor wrote that the legislation is unnecessary because 90% of New Mexicans who are eligible for the benefits already receive them.

“We continue to invite collaboration with advocacy groups to discuss ways to make meaningful improvements to our programs,” the governor wrote.
NM Voices also recommends that New Mexico streamline the SNAP application process so eligible New Mexicans have lower barriers to benefits. Currently, someone can initially apply for SNAP online but cannot report changes in income or renew their benefits online, the report says.
Last fall, New Mexico extended the SNAP exit threshold to 200% of the federal poverty level, up from 165% last year. This means people can continue to receive SNAP even if their income is twice the federal poverty line.

Paige Knight, research director at NM Voices, told Source NM in an interview that the group’s recommendations could change as the proposed federal cuts become reality.
“Whatever happens federally, we may need to update some of those recommendations based on what’s feasible, what changed federally, and make adjustments,” she said.
The report’s third recommendation is for New Mexico to continue softening the SNAP benefit cliff, which is when someone loses eligibility for benefits when their income exceeds the program’s income eligibility limit. The state government could create its own SNAP benefit for households that have recently lost eligibility after increasing their incomes above 200% of the federal poverty lines, and provide an extended benefit for several months to allow families to continue saving money as they transition out of SNAP, Wildau wrote.
New Mexico could also expand the program to reach more people by treating child support payments as an income exclusion rather than a tax deduction, which would lower a household’s taxable income, the report notes.
Finally, the report recommends New Mexico provide SNAP to immigrant households with children who are ineligible for the benefits under federal regulations, and provide protections and education to immigrant families who can receive SNAP but may fear repercussions “due to the changing federal landscape.”

VuotoA prominent business owner in Ludlow reported to federal prison Friday to serve a 20-month sentence related to his role in a kickback scheme in New York. The surrender date for Troy Caruso  — originally scheduled for April 8 — has been extended twice due to requests for time to arrange accommodations for his businesses.Caruso, 57, was indicted and arrested in December 2023 for bribing a project manager working for a global, commercial real estate firm that occurred between February of 2021 to September of 2023. Originally from Long Island, New York, he owns multiple businesses in Ludlow including the Fox Run Golf Club and The Barn at Fox Run and the restaurants Calcuttas, Terra Italian Steakhouse and Off the Rails.The two charges against Caruso, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud and honest services wire fraud are related to payments totaling $48,000 he allegedly made to gain preferential treatment and assistance in bidding on and obtaining construction contracts for a project valued at $3.5 million. Both federal charges have a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. In a deal with federal prosecutors, Caruso pleaded guilty last fall to the first count of the indictment, according to a U.S. Attorney’s Office Southern District of New York press release. On Feb. 28, Caruso was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison, and was ordered to pay forfeitures and fines totaling roughly $816,000, according to federal court documents.Caruso reported Friday to a federal minimum security satellite camp in Otisville, New York to serve his 20-month sentence. In an interview, Caruso said he intends to return to Ludlow after his prison term is finished and said he plans to use the time while incarcerated to seek permits to build condominiums, houses and hotels on his land ownings surrounding the golf course.Caruso was initially set to surrender April 8, but he was granted an extension to April 22 to “arrange accommodations for his businesses,” according to a request letter filed with the court. On April 18, Caruso was granted a second extension of his surrender date to May 9 for additional time for business arrangements. The request letter filed to the court by Caruso’s lawyer stated that “26 of his company accounts have been cancelled, in addition to his personal and business credit cards.” In an interview on April 23, Caruso said he had several outstanding work-related tasks, including initiating new lines of credit and helping with the engineering phase for a condominium project at the Fox Run Golf Course, before his surrender date. In interviews a week prior, Caruso said staff are in place to manage his businesses in Ludlow — including the Fox Run Golf Club and his restaurants — while he serves his sentence. Caruso expects this to be the “busiest year ever” for his various establishments, with the golf club opening for the spring and summer season and his restaurants “all running properly.”Caruso’s 37 limited liability companies based in Ludlow will remain registered under his name as principal manager, he said, except for Sam’s Steakhouse, which the Federal Emergency Management Agency intends to buy out after the building sustained significant flood damage. Caruso’s other business that sustained flood damage, Mr. Darcy’s Bar and Burger, is expected to reopen later this year as a private Bourbon and Cigar bar, he said. In a Feb. 14 letter addressed to the U.S. District Judge Lewis J. Liman, Caruso expressed remorse for his criminal conduct and wrote that his actions were influenced by a downturn in the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic.“My conduct has risked everything I worked so hard to achieve in life. I have also risked the future of my businesses, and more importantly, the future of my employees,” Caruso wrote. “I have lost construction jobs, two lines of credits with two different banks, consulting contracts, multiple credit cards, reputational damage, golf members, customers and endless opportunities.”The Ludlow municipal manager, the Ludlow selectboard vice chair and the executive director of the Okemo Valley Regional Chamber of Commerce said they had no comment on Caruso’s sentencing and the potential impacts on Ludlow’s community and local economy. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ludlow business owner begins 20-month term in federal prison.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fox_run_golf_club_28_select_1_med.jpg,,,2025-05-12 16:07:20.574881

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Rhode Islanders’ health care spending rose 7.8% in 2023 over the previous year — a new state record — thanks in part to more hospital visits and the popularity of pricey weight-loss drugs, according to a new report out Monday.
The finding exceeded the 6% rate anticipated by the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC), which published the annual report on health care spending and quality.  The office is charged with multiple duties regulating the Ocean State’s health insurance plans, including data collection and yearly review of health insurers’ proposed rate increases.
Hospital discharges, outpatient visits, and prescription fills are some of the data points that help OHIC determine utilization, or the overall volume of medical services used by Rhode Islanders. In 2023, Rhode Islanders amassed a total of $9.52 billion in health care spending, or $9,892 per person. All three of the state’s major insurance markets — commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid — went past the 6% cap. The growth cap had already been enlarged from the rate used from 2019 to 2022, which was 3.2%. 
“We expected growth, but we observed much higher growth than we expected,” Commissioner Cory King said. “It wasn’t just price driven, which would account for inflation, but it was utilization driven.”
A significant driver for increased spending: weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide, sold as Ozempic and Wegovy. The drugs belong to a family of type-2 diabetes management drugs called GLP-1 agonists, which work by suppressing glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar. 
In 2023, a total of eight branded GLP-1 drugs comprised $63.2 million in insurance claims, compared to $50.7 million for 122 other drugs in the diabetes and weight-loss categories combined.
That’s not all that surprising, given that the drugs cost about $1,000 a dose, King said. 
“The most frustrating part of my job — and I think other state leaders across the country will agree — is that states just don’t have control over drug pricing,” King said. 
The 7.8% increase is the highest since OHIC began analyzing spending data in 2019. The office calculates an approximate, annual ceiling for the growth of Rhode Islanders’ health care costs, leaving room to accommodate inflation, wages and other economic factors. But prediction could only go so far in a year when inflation soared to its highest in 40 years.
Commercially insured patients saw an increase of about $6,735 per person (a 6.9% increase) and Medicaid patients paid $7,678 more (a 6.7% increase). Medicare represented an 8.7% increase in per person spending, for about $14,400 annual spending per enrollee — something of an anomaly, King thought, as the Medicare growth rate has historically been “relatively low.” 
Spending also differed by insurers, according to OHIC’s estimates. In the commercial market, both Tufts Health Plan and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island were under the cost growth target, at a little under 5% growth. United Health Care saw an 8.5% increase in spending, and Neighborhood Health Plan rose 17.4%. 
Rhode Island’s spending growth was in line with other states that saw unexpected jumps: Connecticut experienced 7.8% growth, Massachusetts 8.6%, and Delaware 9.1%.

A much bigger appetite for Ozempic and friends 
After Ozempic secured widespread cultural and clinical popularity for its success in rapidly reducing appetite and weight, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the rebranded-but-identical Wegovy for weight-loss in 2021.  
OHIC’s analysis found that claims for 30-day prescriptions of the weight-loss drugs doubled from 2022 to 2023, from about 9,000 to over 18,000. Total commercial spending on GLP-1 drugs totaled over $121.4 million from 2021 to 2023, and spending tripled in that time. 
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

King acknowledged the long-term benefits or risks of GLP-1 drugs as weight-loss treatments are still unclear. They might save money in the long run, by lowering obesity rates and the chronic conditions associated with it.   
“But in the short term, we have a tradeoff as a society, as ‘Can we afford to pay the prices that are required?’” King said.
Insurers are asking the same question. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts announced in April it would begin covering GLP-1 drugs for diabetes only.   
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island did not have an immediate comment Monday on the status of GLP-1 coverage in Rhode Island. The company noted in December 2024 that in the first three quarters of 2024, it experienced a $30 million operating loss, generated partially by a $29 million increase in prescription drug costs, including GLP-1 agonists.
Growth is good, sometimes
Health care spending is expected to go up from year to year, the report acknowledges.
“In fact, there are components of Rhode Island’s delivery system, such as primary care, community-based behavioral health care and Medicaid-funded community providers, where spending needs to grow to promote access to care in the most appropriate, lowest cost setting,” the report states.
This year’s report makes two broad recommendations to improve the state’s understanding of how people are spending money on health care: 

Boost investment in primary care across all payers, not just commercial ones. 
Expand state oversight of health care systems and hospitals by making hospital finances more transparent and publicly accessible.

King foreshadowed the first recommendation on April 29 when he joined Gov. Dan McKee and other state health leaders to announce a slate of initiatives meant to repair the state’s primary care challenges.  
If the state builds out its primary care infrastructure, the data should reflect fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations, more efficiency and healthier people, King said.
“I don’t want people to walk away with the inference that, ‘Oh gosh, health care spending is increasing so rapidly; we can’t spend any money anywhere,’” King said. 
King cited the pandemic as one possible reason Rhode Island saw more health care spending than predicted, given widespread interruption in regular checkups and delays in preventative care.
The 2023 data also begins to capture the consumer consequences of rising inflation since 2021. OHIC recommends maximum rate increases for commercial insurers, but King said his office can only adjust these levers sparingly because of multiyear contracts in the private market. There aren’t opportunities to negotiate higher rates accounting for inflation until contracts are up for renewal, he said. 
So far, the preliminary 2024 data shows more of the same, King added, with inflation driving costs, 
King’s office can’t regulate self-funded employer plans, which account for about 60% of employer-sponsored health coverage statewide.
“We don’t have any say in those contracts, but I think we have influence,” King said. 
That influence is not entirely symbolic, King thought, as many of Rhode Island’s self-funded plans are issued by health care systems themselves, like Brown University Health: “I think they should understand the importance of equitable payment for primary care.”
An X-ray into hospital finances
The report’s second recommendation seeking greater state oversight of health care delivery calls for the creation of a statewide data system that can gather, analyze and publicly share information on hospital system finances. The report notes similar databases in Colorado and Massachusetts as examples worth following.
Data like hospitals’ operating margins remains somewhat opaque. A unified data system, King said, could help “create a more balanced picture of how the dollars flow from the taxpayer and the worker down to the provider, and then are redistributed to workers and capital.”










The most frustrating part of my job — and I think other state leaders across the country will agree — is that states just don’t have control over drug pricing. 


– Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King


In 2023, inpatient and outpatient hospital care combined made up more than 40% of all health care spending in the state, the report states. 
In the commercial market, outpatient costs alone increased 11.3%, from $1,618 to $1,801 per person, and emergency department spending rose 12.5%. 
Hospitals usually charged more for basic services like lab tests. In 2023, a routine bloodwork panel may cost $39 at a hospital-based provider, compared to $9 in a non-hospital setting. Hospitals were paid up to seven times more than outpatient clinics to deliver injections and chemotherapies. A typical cost for a medicine injection might be $23 at a standalone clinic, but $235 in a hospital setting. Imaging and endoscopies sported price tags triple in size when delivered in hospitals. 
“The disclosure of those price differences was not meant to say, ‘Oh, gosh, hospitals are bad and non-hospital settings are good,’” King said. “There are reasonable factors at play for why hospitals charge more…But there is an opportunity for savings, ultimately to the consumer and to the employers and the taxpayer, by shifting more care to these non-hospital settings.” 
The full report, plus summaries and a chart book, is available on OHIC’s website.

The case before the state’s high court Wednesday […],"The South Carolina Supreme Court in Columbia. (Mary Ann Chastain / Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A nearly decade-old dispute over whether Amazon owes South Carolina millions in uncollected sales taxes goes before the state Supreme Court this week.
In question is whether the online retail giant should have collected state sales taxes on behalf of third-party sellers on Amazon’s website.
The case before the state’s high court Wednesday is specifically over what was owed in the first quarter of 2016, the months immediately after the expiration of a five-year sales tax exemption approved by the Legislature.
However, the ruling could result in Amazon owing more than $277 million tied to two separate pending cases, according to the state Department of Revenue.
The agency’s initial audit found Amazon owed more than $12 million in taxes, penalties, and interest for not collecting sales taxes from third-party vendors who sold products to South Carolinians in the first three months of 2016.
Amazon balked at that December 2016 assessment and disputed the bill in the Administrative Law Court, which hears challenges of actions by state agencies.
Amazon argued the state tax code was unclear, and that it was the responsibility of those independent sellers to collect taxes from customers and pay the tax bill.
The Administrative Law Court disagreed.
But before Amazon could appeal to the state Court of Appeals — which also sided with the state agency — it had to pay the tab in full. So, Amazon has actually already paid the money at the center of the case justices will hear, according to the state’s tax collection agency.
However, the unpaid tab kept growing until April 30, 2019, when Amazon started collecting sales taxes from third-party sellers and sending it to Revenue.
According to two other state audits, Amazon owes $277.2 million in back taxes and interest from April 1, 2016, through 2019. The second audit came as the Legislature debated a law on third-party sellers, signed by Gov. Henry McMaster on April 26, 2019.
The company has disputed both of those bills to the Administrative Law Court as well. Those cases are on hold pending the outcome of a ruling by the state Supreme Court, according to the Department of Revenue.
Lawyers representing Amazon declined to comment to the SC Daily Gazette on the pending litigation.
A tax deal
Prior to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2018, which reversed an earlier decision, companies needed a physical location in a state to be required to collect and pay taxes from sales within that state.
For Amazon, that meant once it built a distribution center in a state, it would need to collect taxes from online shoppers living there — unless it received an exemption, which it pursued in states nationwide.
South Carolina obliged, promising in 2010 a five-year exemption in exchange for creating at least 1,249 full-time jobs with health benefits and investing $90 million. The deal struck by the administration of then-Gov. Mark Sanford was almost undone after Gov. Nikki Haley took office in January 2011 and attempted to cancel it.
Organizations representing brick-and-mortar retailers opposed the deal as giving Amazon an unfair advantage. After the deal appeared dead, the Legislature ultimately approved the exemption over Haley’s objections after Amazon upped the ante to at least 2,000 full-time jobs with a $125 million investment.
The law resulted in Amazon building its first two distribution facilities in the state in 2011 and 2012 — one in West Columbia and one in Spartanburg.
When the sales tax exemption ended Dec. 31, 2015, Amazon began collecting sales taxes on purchases sold directly by Amazon and its affiliates but not third-party sellers on the website.
Those sellers had the option to pay an additional $40 monthly fee to Amazon to collect the taxes for them. But Amazon still sent the money to the seller to forward to Revenue. Many sellers chose not to bother.
‘The flow of funds’
In his order, Chief Administrative Law Judge Ralph Anderson III compared Amazon to a consignment shop.
Like a consignment shop owner, Amazon collects various fees for its services, controlling “the flow of funds between customers” and therefore making the company responsible for tax collection, he wrote.
Judges in the Administrative Law Court and Court of Appeals also shut down arguments by Amazon that definitions in state law of a retailer left tax collection responsibilities open to interpretation.
Amazon claimed it’s operating an online marketplace — that it did not own the goods and was not the seller. Rather, it was simply providing a platform.
But lawyers for the state countered that Amazon “makes no meaningful distinction between sales of its own goods and those owned by third parties.”
“Only Amazon directly interfaces with the customer through the purchase transaction,” state Department of Revenue lawyers continued in written arguments. “Only Amazon accepts and processes customer payments, and Amazon is the only point of sale for all transactions on the website. Thus, only Amazon has the ability to collect sales and use taxes.”
A question of ambiguity
In its written argument filed with the state Supreme Court, Amazon suggests the high court should take its side because the previous rulings weaken a “longstanding protection for taxpayers against the overzealous enforcement of the tax laws.”
Amazon argues it’s a long-held practice that “a taxpayer receives the benefit of any reasonable interpretation of a tax statute.”
“This protection is recognized across the country, is essential for sound financial and business planning, promotes legislative accountability for tax burdens on the public, and makes tax enforcement uniform and fair,” the company’s lawyers wrote.
The U.S., state and Columbia chambers of commerce also have come to the defense of Amazon in briefs filed with the court saying certainty is essential to businesses’ hiring and operating decisions.
“To adopt successful business strategies and to make effective investments, businesses must be able to predict their tax obligations with accuracy. A lack of predictability in tax laws, in contrast, harms both the business community and the overall economy,” the groups wrote in court documents.
But lawyers for the state said “the mere fact that the parties disagree … does not mean that the statute is ambiguous or must be construed in favor of the taxpayer — it just means that one of the parties is wrong.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SCSupremeCourt-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 15:07:33.781822

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)For the second time in as many years, South Dakota Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds has formally asked the federal Department of the Interior to establish a tribal law enforcement training center in his home state.
This year’s request took the form of a letter from Rounds to Doug Burgum, who served as North Dakota’s governor before ascending to the role of Interior secretary for the Trump administration.
Rounds and U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota agitated for a regional Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement training center last year. Johnson had previously pushed for field hearings that would bring members of Congress to tribal areas to learn the challenges of policing them. 
AmeriCorps cuts are ‘devastating’ for nonprofit Native American school in South Dakota, lawsuit says

Their advocacy last year dovetailed with the controversy sparked by comments from former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem Noem, who’s now secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. She said Native American reservations in South Dakota were overrun by Mexican drug cartel members and that some tribal leaders were benefiting from it. She also said that unemployment and absent parents had left Native American children bereft of hope.
Leaders of all nine tribes in the state voted to ban her from their lands in the months that followed. Some have since rescinded the bans.
Noem, who said a lack of tribal law enforcement exacerbates public safety problems, worked with Attorney General Marty Jackley to sponsor an additional state-level basic law enforcement training academy session last summer that gave priority to Native American recruits.
Typically, potential Native American officers from South Dakota attend 12 weeks of basic law enforcement training in Artesia, New Mexico — 1,000 miles or more from home.
The 11 recruits trained in Pierre last year were able to get their certification to work in policing in South Dakota, but were also given the chance to remotely complete an additional BIA training module called the Bridge Training Program that would typically take place in New Mexico.
As Noem sparred with tribes rhetorically and pushed to train more tribal officers in South Dakota’s state training academy, the congressional delegation pushed the BIA to establish a regional training center in Pierre. 
Such a center, they argued, would allow potential Native American police officers to train during the week and return home to their families on weekends.
Rounds reiterated that point in Monday’s letter to Burgum.
“Many tribal law enforcement leaders believe that the distance to the New Mexico facility is a barrier to recruitment,” Rounds wrote.
He suggested that an existing training center could serve as a satellite training location for tribal policing, and pointed to last summer’s training in Pierre as an “encouraging” sign that such a setup can work.

Ron DeSantis speaking at the Florida Highway Patrol's offices in Tampa on May 12, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)After negotiations over the state budget between the GOP House and Senate leadership broke down Friday, the Florida Republican Party of Florida stepped in, proposing to host a summit between Gov. Ron DeSantis, Speaker Daniel Perez, and Senate President Ben Albritton.
The talks would include senior staff and leadership teams in a bid for a common path forward as the two chambers remain billions of dollars apart due to competing tax cut proposals.
But DeSantis said Monday that he’s not interested.
“With all due respect though, that’s not the role of the Republican Party of Florida,” he said in response to a question asked by a Phoenix reporter during a press conference in Tampa.
“And so no, we’re not going to do a dog and pony show. That’s not the way this works. The way it works is people should do their jobs.
“Now my role in the process is to sign or veto the budget as a whole but also individual line items in the budget, so there may be things that I’ll say — ‘Hey, this is something that I’m going to be looking for’ — and obviously the Legislature needs to take that into account. But the reality is the House leadership has kind of careened off course the whole session, not just on the budget, let’s just be clear. This has been the whole session this has happened. ”
DeSantis has been relentless in blasting the Florida House over the past month, initially over a committee’s investigation into the Hope Florida Foundation, the initiative connected to DeSantis and his wife Casey DeSantis. The bitter rancor has now moved on to the House’s support for a major sales tax cut. DeSantis and his supporters have instead been pushing for lawmakers to cut property taxes.
DeSantis spent considerable time Monday when asked about the situation between the two chambers to boast about how he’s handled the state budget during his six-plus years in Tallahassee. He said that, under his leadership, he’s been able  to reduce the state’s debt by 41% but also made important investments in law enforcement, transportation, environmental restoration, and education.
‘Just keep doing what we’ve been doing’
“You don’t need a summit to just keep doing what we’ve been doing,” he said. “And I think if you look at my budget, we build off the success that we’ve had. I don’t know what’s gone on in terms of the breakdown [between the House and Senate]. I wasn’t a part of those negotiations per se, because, quite frankly, the Senate and the House go back and forth on these things. But I can tell you, the voters want us to continue doing what we’ve done. To build off the success, to meet challenges that are before us, and to put their interests first.”
In his statement released on Friday afternoon, Republican Party of Florida Chairman Evan Power suggested a summit would present an opportunity for the state’s GOP leaders to “collaborate, unite, and deliver relief and lasting results for Florida families.”
“Our Republican leaders are deeply committed to this state and have bold ideas to keep Florida thriving,” Power said. “Bringing everyone to the table will help us focus on our shared priorities — fiscal responsibility, tax relief, and a balanced budget.”
While there is no date yet when the full Legislature will return to Tallahassee to take up the budget impasse, the House is scheduled to meet on Tuesday for a floor session to pass a concurrent resolution extending the timeline to continue budget negotiations through the end of June. The new fiscal year opens on July 1.
Also, the 37-member House committee formed to study the possibility of reducing or eliminating property taxes in the state is also scheduled to convene.

Last week, he went back with a new issue in mind.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Lisa Hagen to discuss her article, “With federal funding in flux, a CT farmer went back to Washington,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Lisa’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Lisa, you tell us about Willie Dellacamera — he’s a Northwood, Connecticut farmer who first got media attention when he rode his farm tractor all the way to Washington, DC last year. That’s a fascinating story. But why did he have to go back again this time?
LH: Yeah. Willie Dellacamera, along with other Connecticut farmers and generally around New England, have been waiting for disaster and ag farm relief for some months now. And so I had written about this federal block grant that got passed in a major, major bill to fund the government at the end of December basically. And so I was just curious to follow up on it. I hadn’t seen that the Farm Aid had gone out yet; states like Connecticut are still negotiating it. And so I just kind of happened to reach out to Willie about a week or so ago, and I wanted to come see him on his farm and get a sense of where things stood. Within a matter of days, he was in D.C., and he was coming to watch the Agriculture Secretary and lawmakers talk about this farm relief and just USDA writ large.
WSHU: So what was his experience like?
LH: It was something that I don’t think he even quite expected. Basically, there was a pair of hearings that the Agriculture Secretary, Brooke Rollins, was going to testify at. The public can go to any of these hearings. They can sit down; they can listen to her testimony. And so he did that. He was able to go for two days, during which she was testifying, and when she wrapped up, he went over to the door to meet her, and she took the time to hear him out. They talked about the farm aid that still needed to come down. And you know, he was pretty pleasantly surprised. He told me he got phone numbers of the staff, and within two days, I mean, she knew his name, his story, and had invited him to a press conference. And so, you know, he and others are just, again, still waiting for this aid to come out.
WSHU: But he wasn’t expecting the reception that he got, considering that the Trump administration has been pushing for cuts to all sorts of federal agencies, and there was no guarantee that this money was going to go out. Even right up to the end, I remember speaking with Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, who was pushing for this, and the money comes directly to the farmers in the Northeast. The small farmers in the Northeast. It is a unique system, and the first time this has ever happened, we had a new administration coming in. The whole feeling at that time was, was this really going to happen? And here we are now, and it seems as if Dellacamera came away feeling a little bit optimistic that it might happen. What exactly is the situation right now?
LH: Exactly. There was really no expectation for him going into this. He didn’t know if the block grant was going to come up at the hearings or if Secretary Rollins would stop and talk with him. And so there was a Senate hearing and a House hearing. It had come out that the Senate one, and it was a bit unclear where that funding stood, because they were talking about much larger pots of disaster money. And so that was kind of the focus. But when it was the House hearing, Congresswoman DeLauro, who again helped set up this block grant money, was very specifically talking about that $220 million for New England and small farms. And so basically, she wanted to get Rollins on record as committing to that funding.
So what I came out of those hearings understanding was, there is still a commitment that money will flow. They had given an end-of-May deadline, but it’s still a bit vague. It was unclear whether that meant states like Connecticut and their Ag department would finalize agreements about that funding, or if they meant that that money would actually flow at that time. So you know, they’re skeptical exactly of what that end of May deadline looks like, but at least they felt like they got that commitment that that money is still intended as Congress appropriated to flow, and farmers will eventually get that. It’s just unclear exactly when.
WSHU: In the meantime, Dellacamera and other farmers in his position have all these bills to pay. So what are they being advised to do? And what are they doing?
LH: Well, exactly. And you know, as I was watching Dellacamera tell Secretary Rollins, the first time he met her, he was saying that he was getting creditors calling all the time. She advised him, you know, to tell him that that $220 million was coming. But I imagine for people who are on the hook for all those bills and the people wanting to get paid, you know, just hearing words of federal money will come, is not enough. And so it’s definitely a tough position. He owes hundreds of thousands of dollars. He wants to be able to pay these bills off. And again, they don’t know when this money is coming. And so I think in the coming months, it’s going to put a lot of farmers in Connecticut and the region in a really tough position of how to move forward. And you know, this disaster money will come out at some point. But Dellacamera also told me he relies on this local farm assistance program, where he gets money from the federal government and gives local food to food banks, and that money will actually stop in October. That is money that the Trump administration has terminated.
WSHU: So it’s not a good position to be a small farmer in Connecticut right now.
LH: It’s hard. And you know, that was a program that was mutually beneficial for everyone. It was for the people receiving that food, being able to eat local, healthy food. It was dedicated income for the farmers and producers. And, you know, ways that the schools and food banks were involved. And so losing that revenue stream is really tough. And on top of it all, these farmers who suffered extreme weather that basically damaged their farms in 2023 and 2024 are still waiting on this disaster relief.
WSHU: So, bottom line, it was worth it for him to go to Washington.
LH: I think so. Again, he was not expecting to get as much face time as he did. Congresswoman DeLauro gave him a lengthy shout-out that’s now in the congressional record at these hearings. And so he is hoping that by putting, you know, a face to the story and to that policy, it shows the need for these farmers to have this money.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4682-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 15:07:33.781822

On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will evaluate a deal the states say solve legal issues over Rio Grande water, which the federal government objects to. Federal and local partners are inviting New Mexicans in Sierra and Doña Ana counties to participate this week in planning for projects to address flooding, drought and water conservation in the Lower Rio Grande Basin.
Southern New Mexico faces less water making its way into the Rio Grande, with reliance growing on groundwater from agriculture and, to a smaller extent, cities. Alternatively, storms supercharged by warmer weather have also produced devastating floods in recent years, hitting crops and infrastructure.
Managers for the federal program hope to address the large problems impacting the Lower Rio Grande — such as damage from flooding and sediment building in the river — promote more aquifer recharge with managing storm water and creating or sustaining habitats.
This week marks the first round of public meetings, according to Connie Maxwell, a regional water planner at the New Mexico Water Resources Research Institute, which is leading the outreach.
“Any water user is welcome, and that would mean all of us,” Maxwell said. “Folks actually living in the region have an enormous amount of local knowledge and it really is the community that has the best sense of what the important priorities are.”




How to attend the meetings
All meetings take place at 6 p.m.
Tuesday, May 13: Doña Ana Community College Sunland Park Center (3365 McNutt Road)
Wednesday, May 14: Hatch Community center (837 West Hall Street)
Thursday, May 15: Center for Spiritual Living in Las Cruces (575 North Main Street)
Wednesday, May 21: Albert J. Lyons Event Center in Truth or Consequences (2953 South Broadway Street




In addition, an online survey asks participants to rank the goals for future projects and solicit ideas for development. Residents can also sign up to participate in additional working groups, which are voluntary positions.
“This particular project, it’s not just a planning effort, it’s really focused on implementation,” Maxwell said, noting that water planning often centers on short-term fixes to address flooding in a certain area.
“It’s becoming critical to address the root of the problems at the same time,” she said, adding that one of the efforts will address the feedback loop of pumping more groundwater, and losing recharge.
The survey will be open for several more months, but an initial assessment of submitted projects will begin after June 15, followed by another round of input and project assessments, Maxwell said.
Last May, the U.S. The Department of Interior under the Biden administration awarded nearly $60 million in Inflation Reduction Act funding to develop projects or programs that benefit the network of dams and canals in the Rio Grande Project and endangered species.
The federal funding was allocated to a partnership including the NM WRRI, The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Elephant Butte Irrigation District and nonprofit National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.
Whether this program will be impacted by federal cuts, which have included climate programs at other federal agencies, remains unclear.
An emailed request for comment to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation media office regarding the exact funding available for this program had not been returned prior to publication.

Gavin Newsom urges cities to make certain camps illegal.","In summary
In his latest push to crackdown on homeless encampments, Gov. Gavin Newsom urges cities to make certain camps illegal.


Gov. Gavin Newsom has a new strategy to eliminate the large, long-standing homeless encampments that have been a thorn in his side throughout his administration: Push cities to make them illegal. 
The governor on Monday called on every local government in the state to adopt ordinances that restrict public camping “without delay.” He provided a hypothetical model ordinance that lays out exactly what he’d like to see banned: Camping in one place for more than three nights in a row, building semi-permanent structures such as make-shift shacks on public property, and blocking streets or sidewalks.
“There’s nothing compassionate about letting people die on the streets,” Newsom said in a statement. “Local leaders asked for resources — we delivered the largest state investment in history. They asked for legal clarity — the courts delivered. Now, we’re giving them a model they can put to work immediately, with urgency and with humanity, to resolve encampments and connect people to shelter, housing, and care. The time for inaction is over. There are no more excuses.”
Newsom instructed cities and counties to copy his proposed ordinance or change it as they see fit. Though nothing about Newsom’s Monday missive would force cities to adopt this camping ordinance or any other, last year he threatened to withhold funding from local governments that don’t do enough to remove encampments. 
Monday’s push comes with the promise of $3.3 billion to address street homelessness and mental health. That money comes from Proposition 1, a $6.4 billion bond that California voters approved in March to pay for treatment beds and permanent housing. Newsom and other state officials were expected to give more details Monday afternoon.
Newsom also warned cities that they should not prohibit camping at all times across the entire city if no shelter beds are available, and that they should “prioritize shelter and services.” He said cities should store belongings confiscated during encampment sweeps and give their owners a chance to claim them. He suggested cities give encampment residents a 48-hour warning before a sweep.
Newsom’s model ordinance would ban all camping — including sleeping with a sleeping bag or blanket — in one place for three days or nights in a row. Unless a city has enough shelter beds or affordable housing to offer their entire homeless population — which is almost never the case — that means people would be forced to pack up their belongings and move at least 200 feet every three days.
The National Health Care for the Homeless Council has found that encampment sweeps can damage residents’ health, sever their connections to services and set them back on their path toward housing. 
Even in cities that have shelter beds available, going to a shelter often requires people to abandon their pets or belongings, or to go without their partner. A CalMatters investigation earlier this year found some shelters throughout California are plagued by violence, poor conditions and little oversight. 
Newsom’s call to ban certain homeless encampments is the latest salvo in his ongoing fight against street camping. The push started last summer, after the U.S. Supreme Court in Grants Pass v. Johnson ruled that cities can make it illegal to camp on all public property, even if there is nowhere else for people to go. That decision overturned six years of legal protections for homeless residents in California and other western states, where cities effectively had to make sure shelter was available before cracking down on camps. 
A month later, Newsom ordered state agencies to adopt policies to clear encampments on their property, and urged local governments to do the same. Since then, more than two dozen California cities and counties have passed new camping bans, resumed enforcing old bans or made existing ordinances more punitive. 
This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

(Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Kansas county health officers issued warnings about four sites where people may have been exposed to measles, as the number of cases increases.
Confirmed measles cases have spread outside the initial eight southwest Kansas counties, with one case confirmed in Wichita and another in Hutchinson. As of last Wednesday, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment had reported 48 cases statewide. That number doesn’t yet include the cases in Sedgwick or Reno counties.
In Wichita, the Sedgwick County Health Department lists two possible exposure sites. Anyone who was at the Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport from 6:15 p.m. to 9 p.m. May 2 should monitor symptoms until May 23. And anyone at Carnicerias El Guero No. 1 grocery store, 524 W. 21st St N. in Wichita, from 6:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. April 29 should monitor symptoms until May 20.
Adrienne Byrne, Sedgwick County health director, said the delay in letting the public know about measles exposure happens because symptoms can take time to show up. 
“Once someone is infected, it takes one to two weeks for symptoms to show,” she said. 
Initial symptoms of fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes can be mistaken for a cold or flu, Byrne said. Then within two or three days, tiny white spots inside the mouth can occur with a bluish white center, then shortly after a rash forms.
It’s not until the rash appears that many people realize they have measles, she said.
“By that time, they’re almost at the end of their infectious period because people are infectious four days before the rash and four days after the rash,” Byrne said.
Once health officials become aware of a case, epidemiologists work with the infected person and their family to figure out where they might have been in the preceding days.
As of Monday morning, the Sedgwick County Health Department hadn’t received any phone calls from people concerned they may have been exposed at the airport, she said. They have contacted everyone on the airplane who was exposed and all have been vaccinated, Byrne said.
She encouraged anyone with measles symptoms who visited either of the two locations to call a hotline at 316-660-5558 to speak with a health professional.
Byrne said the county’s epidemiologist is trained to help people feel comfortable talking about the locations they’ve visited and sharing who may have been exposed.
“People feel guilty if they’ve exposed someone,” she said, adding that they often don’t want to make people miss work. If an unvaccinated person is exposed, they should quarantine for 21 days, she said.
The COVID-19 pandemic made people less willing to trust government officials and to share information, Byrne said.
“We are in a Republican state, and more and more it’s the right to individual freedom and the right of the individual versus the good of all,” she said. “So much distrust happened during COVID.”
Other exposure sites in Kansas include the Hutchinson Public Library, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. May 3; and B & P Auto Parts, 515 S. Main St. in Cimarron, all day May 2, May 5 and May 6.
State health officials encourage individuals to know their vaccination status. Byrne said the vaccine is 97% effective, so it’s rare that someone who has been fully vaccinated becomes ill.
If someone has been in one of the exposure sites and is unvaccinated, they should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after the exposure, she said. If they suspect they might have measles, they should not go to the doctor or the emergency room but should instead call the hospital or their doctor.

(Photo by Holly Hildreth/Getty Images)Lawmakers advanced a proposal Monday to provide state funding for schools to stock free feminine hygiene products in women’s restrooms — but it may have a hard time making it to the finish line this session.
House File 883 would provide state funding for schools to have menstrual products like tampons and sanitary pads available in school women’s bathrooms for 6th through 12th grade students from July 1, 2025 through June 30, 2028. The bill had received approval in March from the House Education Committee, but had not been discussed in the months since.
At a House appropriations subcommittee meeting Monday, Angela Caulk with the Family Planning Council of Iowa, thanked lawmakers for their work “behind the scenes” on the bill, ensuring that it was still in the discussion.

“Just as a woman and someone who was a teenager, I just want to thank you all for this, because I think it can make a big difference,” she said.
In earlier meetings on the bill, students and supporters said providing these products for free in school restrooms will help low-income students and help reduce chronic absenteeism at Iowa schools. The measure was brought up in part because of advocacy efforts by the nonprofit Love for Red, an organization focused on providing free sanitary products. Students who created the nonprofit alongside their school counselor said a pilot program providing these products for free led to a reduction in female student absences.
Rep. Amy Nielsen, D-North Liberty, questioned if the funding for the proposal was coming from State Supplemental Aid (SSA), the per-pupil funding for Iowa’s K-12 schools — but Rep. Devon Wood, R-New Market, said it was her understanding this proposal would provide new funding from fiscal years 2026 through 2028. The legislation states that after 2028, funding for the measure would come from SSA.
The legislation does not set an exact allocation for providing these products, but states “an amount necessary to fund the full cost of compliance” will come from the state’s general fund for the 2026-2028 time period. Wood said she understood questions about the exact funding for this measure, but said the measure will provide needed support for students in difficult situations.
“I think that’s an important question to note, so we make sure we know where we’re at, budgetarily, going forward with this,” Wood said. “But I think if this is something that we can do … we do need to assess the need to make sure that we’re fulfilling that (need).”
As the House Appropriations Committee did not take up the bill at its meeting Monday, the funding proposal is unlikely to make it into the state’s final budget for fiscal year 2026. Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, the committee chair, said there’s only one bill outstanding for the committee to consider — the standing appropriations bill — before the committee is done for the year. While the money for feminine hygiene products could come up in this meeting, the bill would also need to pass on the House floor and then go through the committee process in the Senate, as the other chamber has not considered the measure or passed a companion bill this session.
The proposal could be added to another appropriations bill that will make it through the session, but the measure was not included in the budget agreement reached between Senate and House Republicans.
Victoria Sinclair, lobbying on behalf of several organizations including those for Iowa school nurses, school counselors, school psychologists, said her clients have proposed an amendment to remove the spending component of this bill and allow school staff to be able to place donated products in school restrooms. The language has not yet been filed as an amendment to the bill.
“I understand that the appropriation has been a big hold up for many years as we looked at this,” Sinclair said. “And it’s our understanding that many schools actually do have a decent amount of donated products, as well as folks willing to donate.”

Nearly 1,000 resident physicians at the University of Minnesota are officially unionized with SEIU Committee of Interns and Residents after a state labor board certified on Friday that a majority of residents signed union cards.
The certification comes on the heels of more than 200 resident physicians at Hennepin Healthcare achieving certification last month as the first union of resident physicians in Minnesota.
“We work very hard to take care of people all over the Twin Cities and beyond, and burnout is a real problem,” said Dr. Kaitlin McLean in a statement released by the union. “It’s essential that we have a seat at the table so we can care for ourselves and our patients, and so that we can stay here in Minnesota doing that critical work.”
The union drives at both Hennepin Healthcare and the University of Minnesota were remarkably fast compared to the private sector because of a recent change in state law, which governs public sector employees.
Under a 2023 law passed by the then-DFL-controlled Legislature and signed by Gov. Tim Walz, the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services will certify a union without a secret mail ballot election if the agency can verify a majority of the bargaining unit has signed cards in support of the union. The Legislature also made it easier for University of Minnesota employees to unionize that year.
In the private sector, workers often must vote in an election after filing a petition with federal labor regulators.
While physicians can look forward to highly paid jobs in medicine, their four or so years of residency after medical school in which they work under the supervision of an attending physician is defined by low pay, crushing workloads and little power to negotiate.
University of Minnesota resident physicians regularly work 80 hours a week for as little as $16 an hour. Resident physicians note they have little power over their pay or working conditions because of the national process through which newly minted doctors match with residency programs.
A spokesperson for the university shared a statement saying it had received notice of the union certification from the Bureau of Mediation Services and that it “honors its obligations under the Public Employment Labor Relations Act.”
It’s still rare for doctors — traditionally the most privileged and valued of hospital staff — to pursue collective bargaining to improve their wages and conditions.
But the consolidation of health care is making doctors increasingly feel more like workers on assembly lines than masters of their own practices.
In 2023, more than 550 primary and urgent care clinicians — including doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners — across dozens of Allina Health facilities voted to form what was then the nation’s largest private-sector union of advanced health care providers. Just a few months later, the union of more than 130 Allina Health doctors at Mercy and Unity hospitals was certified over the health system’s objections.
SEIU’s Committee of Interns and Residents, which represents more than 37,000 doctors nationwide, says it’s one of the fastest growing health care unions in the country, doubling in size since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The union won six elections with 250 or more workers across the country in January 2025 alone.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/university-of-minnesota-medical-center-1024x643.png,,,2025-05-12 15:07:33.781822

(Photo via the Florida House)Lawmakers during this past session refused to make changes to the state’s heavily criticized and often politicized claims bill process, but at the same time signed off on $27 million worth of payments in lawsuits that had been filed against local governments.
A Florida Phoenix review of the 2025 session shows the Legislature passed nine claims bills totaling $26,938,364 in liability that will be passed on to local governments or entities acting on their behalf.
The City of Gainesville is responsible for the largest claims bill (HB 6251), which will allow the payment of $10.8 million against the city for the negligence of a utility employee who ran a stop sign on his way home from work. The accident left Jacob Rodgers paralyzed from the waist down.
The bill analysis shows that of the total claim, $2.6 million-plus will go to his attorneys and another $137,500 will be paid to lobbyists who, according to the lobbyist disclosure system, are Matthew Forrest and Adrian Lukas with the firm Ballard Partners.
Conversely, the smallest claim bill passed during the 2025 session (SB 22) was for $200,000 and involved Joe Dimaggio Children’s Hospital and the death of a seven-year-old-child, referred to in the record as E.E.M. The hospital, part of the South Broward Hospital District, did not oppose the claims bill, filed on behalf of Eric Miles Jr. and Jennifer Miles, E.E.M’s parents.
Claims bills are required because Florida enjoys sovereign immunity for state and local governments as a legal sovereign from civil lawsuits filed in state court. The state does, however, allow negligence claims against itself and its subdivisions — agencies, cities, counties, and public hospitals — within limits.
Set in statute, those limits are $200,000 per person and $$300,000 per occurrence.
Injured parties can sue for damages and collect within those limits. But jury awards beyond those limits cannot be collected without the Legislature first approving a claims bill.
The claims bill process is lengthy and allows the defendant to challenge a jury verdict — two reasons why, Rep. Fiona McFarland says, she has twice filed legislation to change the law.
Her latest effort, HB 301, was one of the most heavily lobbied bills in Tallahassee this session, drawing 214 lobbyist registrations. The original bill would have increased the caps to $1 million per person and $3 million per occurrence.  She later agreed to tag on an amendment that increased the caps to  $500,000 per person and $1 million per incident for claims accruing on or after Oct. 1 and  $600,000 per person and $1.1 million per occurrence for claims that accrue on or after Oct. 1, 2030.
While the amended bill passed the House by comfortable margins it never was considered by the Senate.
“I’m very disappointed,” McFarland told the Florida Phoenix as the session drew to an end.
She promised she’d sponsor the bill during the 2026 session. 
While McFarland pushed the bill to change what she called an arbitrary process, a bid to raise the limits was opposed by local governments and public hospitals.

(Photo via Google Earth) Newly reported federal data shows the overwhelming majority of nursing homes in Iowa and the United States are operating with too few staff to meet resident’s basic needs.
Eleven of Iowa’s 410 nursing homes were staffed at least 40% below the level expected to meet residents’ needs during the third quarter of 2024, according to the data. Among the 50 states, Iowa ranked in the middle of the pack, with staffing levels that averaged 20% below expectations.
According to federal data compiled by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and then analyzed by the nonprofit Long Term Care Community Coalition, nine in 10 nursing homes across the country were staffed below the level expected based on resident needs.

The report comes as Congress considers budgetary proposals that include instructions requiring the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to delay, until January 2035, enforcement of new minimum staffing standards for nursing homes.
Richard Mollot, LTCCC’s executive director, said the coalition’s methodology for calculating resident needs isn’t based on arbitrary benchmarks, but on each facility’s first-hand evaluation of its own residents’ condition and medical needs.
“It gives residents, families, operators, and policymakers a clear and meaningful way to gauge whether a nursing home is adequately staffed to ensure safe, appropriate care,” he said.
In the third quarter of 2024, the study shows, the average U.S. nursing home provided 3.73 total nurse staff hours per resident, per day. Based on resident acuity, the national average expected staffing level was 4.94 hours. As a result, the median nursing home fell 25% short of expected staffing levels, according to the coalition.
Only two states — Alaska, where staffing levels averaged 21% above expectations, and Oregon, where the homes were staffed 2.5% above expectations — met or exceeded their expected staffing levels.
The states with the worst overall staffing averages included Illinois, where the homes averaged 37.7% below expected levels, followed by Texas, New Mexico, Missouri, Georgia and Virginia, all of which were at least 30% below expected levels.
Lowest-rated Iowa homes are in rural and urban areas
The new report indicates there’s insufficient data on staffing for 13 of Iowa’s 410 nursing homes. Of the remaining 397 homes, 34 are reported to be staffed at or above the expected level.
There are 11 Iowa nursing homes that were staffed at a level at least 40% below the expected level based on each home’s assessment of residents’ needs. State records show that of those 11 homes, seven were cited by state inspectors for insufficient nursing staff at some point during the past 10 years.
The 11 Iowa homes that were staffed at least 40% below the expected level are:
Adel Acres in Dallas County: 47.5% below. The home was last cited for insufficient nursing staff in December 2021.

Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.

Half of U.S. kids

About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.

School health services

Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”










As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services


But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”

Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

More than 10,000 orphaned baby birds were rescued last week in Delaware after a shipping mishap left them stranded at a postal distribution center.
The Delaware Department of Agriculture (DDA) and the First State Animal Center (FSAC) stepped in to save the birds, which were discovered in undeliverable boxes at the USPS Delaware Processing and Distribution Center on May 2.
The initial call to DDA reported a single box of chicks, but a follow-up alert revealed multiple packages.

Staff from DDA’s Poultry and Animal Health section and FSAC worked late into the night to care for the animals, which included chicks, turkeys, geese, quail, and chukars.
The birds were originally shipped from Freedom Ranger Hatchery in Pennsylvania on April 29.
An estimated 4,000 birds had already died due to prolonged exposure to unsuitable conditions.
The surviving animals were transported to FSAC for care and rehabilitation.
Officials say the birds were en route to destinations across the country — some as far as Spokane, Washington — but somehow ended up in Delaware.
Freedom Ranger Hatchery, which is certified as disease-free under the National Poultry Improvement Plan, is investigating the cause of the routing error.
The rescued birds are currently being rehabilitated and will be available for adoption soon.
FSAC is expected to announce adoption details early next week via their website here.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, two potential Democratic candidates for president 2028, will headline the Florida Democratic Party’s (FDP) annual Leadership Blue Gala next month at the Seminole Hard Rock in Hollywood, officials announced Thursday.
Booker, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, made history last month when he stood on the Senate floor and gave a 25-hour speech protesting the actions of the Trump administration. It was the longest floor speech in the history of the U.S. Senate.
  N.J. U.S. Sen. Cory Booker will appear with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear at the Florida Democratic Party’s annual Leadership Blue Gala in June.
Beshear is the popular two-term governor of Kentucky who has shown an ability as a Democrat to win in a red state. He is believed to be seriously considering a run for president in 2028.
“Senator Booker and Governor Beshear are two of the brightest starts of today’s Democratic Party, and their visit to Florida is more proof of the party’s commitment to the future of our state and the importance of the South,” said FDP Chair Nikki Fried in a written statement.
The event is considered the FDP’s premier fundraising event of the year. It will take place with the party once again back on its heels following the defection two weeks ago of one of its legislative leaders, South Florida Sen. Jason Pizzo, who turned independent, saying that the state party was “dead.”
The Republican Party of Florida is holding its Florida Freedom Forum on Aug. 2 at the Rosen Shingle Creek Hotel in Orlando, which will feature U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, Attorney General James Uthmeier, and U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, among others.
The FDP’s Leadership Blue Weekend is scheduled to take place from June 20-June 22.

They were quickly removed. (Courtesy of Autumn Featherstone)On Feb. 24, 2025, my friends and I were kicked out of the Utah House of Representatives gallery. Why? Because after House Speaker Mike Schultz ignored multiple phone calls and emails, we tried to deliver a petition to him directly. When our petition was refused once again, we donned gas masks and bright T-shirts inscribed with our demands and walked silently into the House gallery. Within minutes, we were removed by security.
We wrote our petition in response to Schultz’s call for a “pause” on Great Salt Lake-related water legislation for the 2025 session, and the announcement that Utah would be hosting the 2034 Olympics. We demanded the following actions to protect and restore the Great Salt Lake by 2034:

No new water diversions or developments that would further deplete the Great Salt Lake.
Increase water flow to the Great Salt Lake by 1 million acre-feet per year, restoring the lake to a minimum elevation of 4,198 feet.
Commit to continuous assessment of water policy, ensuring that solutions are adaptive and responsive to the evolving crisis.

Nearly 250 Utahns signed this petition, but it still hasn’t reached the legislator’s desk.
I have lived my entire life less than an hour from the Great Salt Lake. Yet, like it was for many residents of Utah, the lake was simply an afterthought. It was only when I heard about the serious risks tied to its drying up that I started to pay attention. The Great Salt Lake is a breathtaking, unique ecosystem that is a vital stopover for millions of birds during migration. It is also a thin blanket that protects millions of people from decades of buildup of toxic metals in the lakebed. Currently, over 900 square miles of lakebed are exposed, and 2.8 million Utahns breathe the pollution downwind — including me.
The lake is essential to my survival and future as a young person. I am 19 years old and I want to spend the rest of my life here in this beautiful state, but if our legislators continue to ignore this ongoing crisis, I will have to leave my home behind. I am inheriting a world that has been discarded by legislators who make decisions about my future while shutting out my voice. They are silencing youth and refusing to take action on the issues that matter to us, while putting their energy towards legislation that actively harms us.
Despite the massive impacts of the lake drying up, Mike Schultz placed a moratorium on major water bills, citing the need for “a break.” But the legislature seemed to have plenty of energy for legislation that harms youth rather than helping us. This legislative session, Utah became the first state to ban pride flags in all school and government buildings, making it harder for queer youth to find safe spaces in their schools. Lawmakers also passed legislation barring transgender students from living in dorms that align with their gender identity, and approved another bill that restricts comprehensive health education in schools. They’re also trying to end collective bargaining rights for the upcoming generation of public sector workers.
 These issues on education, workers’ rights, public health, LGBTQ+ rights, and lack of adequate environmental policy all stem from the same crisis: a government that ignores science, dismisses the voices of young people and other marginalized communities, and targets the most vulnerable instead of protecting us. By spending so much time and resources actively infringing on our human rights, they are passively infringing on our right to a healthy environment. Air pollution shortens our lives by two years — queer people, educators, and unions do not. But instead of addressing existential issues head-on, legislators are “rearranging deck chairs” on a sinking ship. They need to get their priorities straight.
Utah claims to be the country’s most “family-friendly” state, yet its policies are anything but. The Utah legislature is ignoring the issues that matter most to young people while spending all their time pushing bills that disproportionately harm us. Despite the legislature’s best efforts, youth are still fighting. Even though our emails, calls, text messages, and in-person requests to deliver the petition were ignored, we are not giving up. We are continuing to demand that the state take the necessary steps to protect the Great Salt Lake and our future.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2439-e1747066187225-1024x897.jpeg,,,2025-05-12 12:19:23.762894

U.S. markets rallied following the announcement.U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will drop to a universal 10% baseline, down from the 145% President Donald Trump imposed last month. Trump’s previous 20% emergency tariffs announced in February on all products because of illicit fentanyl chemicals from China will remain in place, as will protective tariffs on goods still in place from the president’s first term. New duties on small packages sent to the U.S. from China, valued at less than $800, will also remain.Fentanyl discussionTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that he and Chinese counterparts “had a very robust and highly detailed discussion” on preventing fentanyl and the chemicals to make the synthetic opioid from entering the U.S.“The upside surprise for me from this weekend was the level of Chinese engagement on the fentanyl crisis in the United States. They brought the deputy minister for public safety,” Bessent said.Bessent told reporters that overall negotiations were “always respectful.”“We had the two largest economies in the world. We were firm — and we moved forward … We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve and I think we did a good job on that,” Bessent said.The White House touted the 90-day pause as a “landmark deal” in a Monday press release.China has agreed to lower its tariffs on U.S. goods to 10%, down from 125%, according to a joint statement.Tariffs are taxes on goods coming across the border.

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”










As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services


But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”

Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

According to the executive order, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would be responsible for the rulemaking  “to impose most-favored-nation pricing.”“We are going to pay the lowest price there is in the world,” Trump said.Prescription pricing for brand-name drugs in the U.S. is more than four times higher than in similar countries, according to a 2024 study by the nonpartisan research nonprofit RAND.Clear price targetsA White House official previewing the policy in a background call with reporters Monday said the president will direct the Department of Commerce to “take all appropriate action” on countries that ""suppress drug pricing abroad.”The Food and Drug Administration will also consider expanding imports of pharmaceutical drugs from nations beyond Canada, the White House official said.Former President Joe Biden issued an executive order to direct the FDA to work with states to import prescription drugs from Canada.The White House official said Kennedy “will set clear targets for price reductions across all markets in the United States.”Kennedy appeared at the White House alongside the president Monday morning.“The United States will no longer subsidize the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing,” Kennedy said. “If the Europeans raise their price of their drugs by just 20%, that is tens of trillions that can be spent on innovation and the health of all people all across the globe.”Trump said Monday the drug pricing policy would be included in the “one, big, beautiful,” reconciliation bill that is the top priority of congressional Republicans. The measure is also expected to provide tax cuts and a significant funding increase to border security.Staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee told reporters twice during a background briefing around the same time that most favored nation prescription drug pricing would not be in that reconciliation package.First termThe order is similar to an effort the president made in his first term, which was struck down in federal court.The White House official said Monday’s order is an expansion of those first-term efforts, which tried to apply the pricing model for those with Medicare – the health insurance program for those who are 65 or older and certain people under 65 who have disabilities – to 50 drugs.“The expectation should not be that we will just be pursuing that same rulemaking,” a White House official said. “We have moved on from that for broader action.”The pharmaceutical industry has long opposed such a move and is already bracing for the president’s planned tariffs on prescription drugs. More details on specific actions in Medicare will be announced later, according to a White House official.“We will be taking action in the Medicare program if the pharmaceutical companies do not come to the table and lower their prices across markets,” the White House official said.Effort unserious, leading Democrat saysU.S. Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, slammed Monday’s executive order.“If Trump was serious about lowering drug prices, he would work with Congress to strengthen Medicare drug price negotiations, not just sign a piece of paper,” Wyden said.The Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats passed along party lines in 2022 when they held unified control of Washington allowed for drug negotiating pricing that aims to lower drug costs for those with Medicare.“Democrats took on Big Pharma and won by finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices on behalf of seniors and capping their out-of-pocket costs for expensive prescriptions,” Wyden said, referring to the law.Jennifer Shutt contributed to this report.",,,,2025-05-12 12:19:23.762894

Tate, a Detroit Democrat who currently serves as a state representative for Michigan’s 9th House district, made his announcement on Sunday, which was first reported by Bloomberg.
“I’m running for Senate to lay a foundation for the next generation of Michiganders, one strong enough to protect the promise Michigan holds for every family,” Tate said in a video posted to social media on Monday. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Tate, a former NFL player who served two combat tours in Afghanistan as a U.S. Marine Corps officer, was Michigan’s first Black speaker of the House, leading the chamber during Democrat’s trifecta in Lansing from 2023 through the end of 2024. 
Under the leadership of Tate and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), Democrats forged ahead on decades of pent-up policy priorities, repealing the state’s right to work laws, retirement tax and its 1931 abortion ban. Democrats also expanded the 1976 Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to add protections against discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation, set a 100% clean energy standard for 2040 and passed sweeping gun reforms, including universal background checks, safe storage requirements and a series of policies allowing for extreme risk protection orders, also known as red flag laws. 
However, Tate’s term as speaker ended on a sour note, as House Republicans walked off the floor, refusing to return unless Tate placed policies on road funding and policies looking to water down changes to the state’s minimum wage and sick leave laws on the agenda. 
While Democrats, who held a 56-54 majority, were able to continue holding votes, the chamber failed to reach a quorum for two days in a row, bringing the House to a sputtering halt. Unable to pass legislation, several bills including proposed bans on ghost guns and bump stocks, a host of bills to address racial disparities in maternal health and plans to subject the Legislature and the Governor to the state’s Freedom of Information Act, were left dead in the water. 
Tate has faced further criticism from both sides of the aisle, as nine bills passed by the Michigan Senate sit in limbo, after the House did not present them to the governor for her signature prior to the new Legislative session. Current House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) has blamed Tate for failing to present the bills, with the impasse resulting in legal action from Brinks and the Senate.
Tate joins a Democratic field that already includes U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed. On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) launched another Senate bid, after an unsuccessful campaign in 2024, which he lost to now-U.S. Sen.

His own family story made him inclined early to “question notions of nationalism or anything like that,” he told Source NM, a tendency his teen years in California only heightened as he became exposed to racism against Latinos.
Collingwood received his Ph.D at the University of Washington where, with Latino polling and research expert Matt A. Barreto as his advisor, he began working on projects with colleague Benjamin Gonzalez O’Brien, with whom he went on to co-author the influential study “Sanctuary Cities: The Politics of Refuge” (Oxford University Press, 2019).
“In graduate school, and since then, most of my network, the people I work with, are… disproportionately Latino, and many of them were from variety of different countries of origins or mixed race,” Collingwood said. “I started to identify a little bit with that crowd, in part because they would talk of their immigration experiences and it just kind of reminded me a bit of the things I’ve dealt with, although I haven’t really had to deal with it to the same degree that they are.”
Collingwood also authored “Campaigning in a Racially Diversifying America: When and How Cross-Racial Electoral Mobilization Works” (Oxford University Press 2020). His research areas also include immigrant detention and privatization. The following interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source: Your 2019 research on sanctuary cities showed that cities with so-called sanctuary policies don’t have more crime as a result. What were the political conditions that prompted you to study and ask those questions?
LC: When Donald Trump first ran for office in 2015 as part of the 2016 campaign, we were really struck by the more or less anti-Mexican immigrant statements that he made. At first, we all thought it was a joke, like a lot of people did. Strategically or not, he really tapped a nerve, and it turned out a lot of people really liked what he had to say, and so we started studying that.
Around that time, there was a white woman…in the Bay Area in San Francisco, which is a sanctuary city, who was shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant who had recently been released from [jail]. That person, had they been in a non-sanctuary city, very likely would have been detained by [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and then put into detention and, potentially, removal proceedings. Suddenly, the claim was getting made that sanctuary cities were causing crime. [Gonzalez O’Brien] and I had already been talking about doing work on sanctuary cities, but we were struggling a little bit with the angle on it.
We started collecting data and trying to figure out which cities are sanctuary cities or not, and when they became sanctuary cities or didn’t. City-level data is often hard to work with — it’s not standardized in any way, so it can often take a really long time to collect that data. But we did it fairly quickly. When we started doing our comparisons, it became pretty clear, pretty soon that the idea that when a city became a sanctuary city suddenly its crime rates increased, just was not really at all true.
A New Mexico-based immigration attorney recently wrote a column for Source NM responding to Trump’s executive order calling for a crackdown on sanctuary cities and characterized it basically as a temper tantrum. What’s your take on it?
In a lot of ways, sanctuary cities have been [Trump’s] pet peeve, probably the thorn in his side this entire time. He tried to undo them in his first administration and that wasn’t successful, and so they’re just taking another crack at it and trying to just come up with various alternative means. I actually think what they’re going to try to do is they’re going to try to prosecute some elected officials and they’re probably trying to see if they can come up with a legal justification for [saying] a sanctuary city is basically the same as harboring and hiding… undocumented immigrants. But that’s just a personal opinion.
The Trump administration has already sued Colorado and Denver over their sanctuary laws. Do you think New Mexico has that sort of risk? We have a high number of sanctuary cities and counties.
New Mexico is a sanctuary state overall, and then several of our counties are and then also several of our cities. I haven’t done this kind of overlapping jurisdictions analysis, but my anecdotal sense — just because I spend a lot of time looking at this data and thinking about it — is that New Mexico is one of the safest place for undocumented immigrants, and it’s generally probably not as much on the administration’s radar. My read… is that our attention has been on the militarized border…that seems to be where we’re getting the most attention, and they haven’t been focusing as much on the interior undocumented population. But I could be wrong about that.
Do you have specific questions about New Mexico’s militarized border zone that you’re thinking about?
My biggest question with this, and with a lot of zone-type issues, which I haven’t done much of yet, but we are looking into it, is basically whether this is going to lead to racially profiling of Latino people or Latinos who speak Spanish. You have a lot of that here in New Mexico, of people who are either citizens and or are legal residents, and they could fairly easily get caught up in that dragnet.
Given the current environment of increased criminalization of undocumented immigrants, how does the work that you’ve done examining private prison lobbying inform what we’re seeing right now?
The main thing we have discovered is there’s a fairly small subset of Democratic legislators who are influenced massively by these private prison companies, whether it’s through donations or actual physical lobbying on the hill in DC or in Santa Fe…or legislators that have these facilities in their districts. Republican legislators just basically are anti-immigrant across the board and punitive. They want more money for detention, and they don’t want to let anyone go free and they want to deport everybody. I mean, literally. It used to not be that way, right? It used to be that a fairly large, sizable portion of the Republican infrastructure was supportive of legal or even guest worker immigration or maybe wasn’t so harsh on illegal immigration. So, whether those Republicans get money from the GEO Group, or whether they have facilities in their district doesn’t really matter, at least that’s what we’ve tended to see.
Democrats are more supportive of legalization [or policies] that would reduce the chances that an undocumented immigrant or an asylum seeker gets put into detention. But when these Democratic legislators do have these facilities in their districts, or they are taking money from Geo Group or Management & Training Corporation or something like that, they’re potentially going to start looking more like the Republican legislators in terms of their voting on relevant immigrant legislation. When I say relevant immigrant legislation, the classic example [were] bills in the New Mexico Legislature that have failed in the State Senate a couple years running that [would have made it] harder for private immigrant detention centers to run in the state and would have potentially put one or two of them out of business. New Mexico, although it’s a Democratic leaning state… they cannot pass a bill like that, at least in my read.
What direction is your work taking now?
[With sanctuary cities], over the last couple of years, we’re just expanding that research. We got the texts of the [sanctuary policies]… and we’ve done a bunch of network analysis where we see how sanctuary cities are copying language from other sanctuary cities, and which ones look more similar than other ones, and there’s regional effects.
And then I have another book project, with my colleague [California State University Northridge Political Science Professor] Jason Morín, and we’re looking at immigrant detention and privatized immigrant detention. [Morín] was [recently cited [in the] New York Times about it.

The department reported both people were unvaccinated and one was hospitalized as a result of the disease. Both people are believed to have contracted measles from international travel.
Two Essentia Health clinics in the Fargo area were exposed to the disease and public health officials said unvaccinated individuals present at those facilities should quarantine themselves for 21 days to monitor for symptoms.
The two clinics exposed were:

Essentia Health – The Lights West Fargo Clinic from 2:30 to 6 p.m., May 7. The entrance to the clinic is shared with Bar Down Sports Bar and Restaurant.
Essentia Health Walk-in Care Clinic from 5:30 to 8 p.m., May 9.

Some schools cancel band trip to Williston because of measles cases; parade to go on

Last week, public health officials reported three schools in Williston were exposed to measles that resulted in about 150 unvaccinated students isolating at home to monitor for symptoms. Nine measles cases have been confirmed in Williams County since May 2.
The health department recommends children between 12-15 months old should receive their first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and a second dose between 4-6 years of age.
“People who are vaccinated and exposed to measles are not likely to develop the disease,” said Molly Howell, immunization director for HHS. “MMR vaccination is critical to preventing the spread of measles in the community. Anyone who is eligible and has not yet been vaccinated is encouraged to contact a trusted health care provider about MMR vaccination.”
Howell said the MMR vaccine is 93% effective after one dose and 97% effective after a second dose.
Adults born before 1957 are generally presumed immune due to natural exposure, the department said.
Immunization records for North Dakota residents can be reviewed through the HHS website or by contacting a health care provider.
Measles symptoms can develop up to 21 days after exposure. The symptoms are:

Fever
Cough
Runny nose
Eye irritation
Body-wide rash

The measles virus is spread through the air and people remain contagious for several days before and after the first symptoms appear, the department said. They added there is no specific medical treatment for measles, but antibiotics may be used in cases resulting in a secondary bacterial infection.
The risk of measles to the general public is low due to a majority of North Dakotans being immunized against the disease.
Vaccines are available through most clinics. For families in need, the federally funded Vaccines for Children Program offers support through local providers.

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”










As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services


But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”

Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

(Getty Images)Indiana is suspending the application period for a Digital Opportunity Grant program, which opened April 30, under orders from President Donald Trump’s administration.
The Indiana Broadband Office announced Monday morning that it “has been notified by our federal partners to suspend” the program.
“At this time, we do not have any further information, but we will share any updates with you as we receive them,” the office added.
Previously called the “Digital Equity Program,” it was part of the federal Digital Equity Act.
The 2021 legislation provided $2.75 billion to establish three grant programs that promote digital equity and inclusion. They were intended to ensure “that all people and communities have the skills, technology, and capacity needed to reap the full benefits of our digital economy,” according to the office’s website.
Trump railed against the program last week, calling it “totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL” in a Truth Social Post last week, the Hill reported.
“No more woke handouts based on race! The Digital Equity Program is a RACIST and ILLEGAL $2.5 BILLION DOLLAR giveaway,” he wrote. “I am ending this IMMEDIATELY, and saving Taxpayers BILLIONS OF DOLLARS!”
The effort aimed to address systemic barriers to digital inclusion for certain populations: aging, incarcerated, disabled, low-income, rural and other people. Veterans, racial and ethnic minorities, and those with language barriers were also targeted for the help.
Indiana was awarded $842,000 in 2022 as part of the Digital Equity Planning Grant to fund the creation of the state’s first “digital equity plan” — although the office now refers to it as a “digital opportunity plan.” The Hoosier plan was developed in collaboration with the Purdue Center for Regional Development and was accepted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in April 2024.
Then, the state was allocated $15 million in Digital Equity Capacity Grant funding to implement the plan.
The state held a May 5 webinar to show entities how to apply, and had another scheduled for June. The deadline to apply was June 13. Those eligible to seek the grants were:

Political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities of the state, such as local government units and agencies responsible for adult education, literacy, or public housing.
Foundations, corporations, institutions, or associations that are not-for-profit entities and not classified as schools.
Community anchor institutions, including schools.
Local education agencies.

They need paid leave, child care they can afford, and food on the table,"" writes James Myall of the Maine Center for Economic Policy. (Photo by Maskot/ Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s team is reportedly seeking ways to encourage Americans to have more children. They’ve looked at everything from baby bonuses to motherhood medals. Yet at the same time, policies perused by the president and his fellow Republicans are making life for parents harder and more expensive. Pronatalism can be a problematic idea, and it’s debatable how much we actually need to increase birth rates. But we should all be able to agree on making kids’ lives more fulfilling and parents’ jobs a little easier. 
Here are some places to start. 
Instead of imposing tariffs that will raise the cost of everything from kids’ clothes to strollers, Republicans could give parents a helping hand by expanding the child tax credit. When the credit was expanded nationally in 2021, the number of children living in poverty in Maine was cut in half. As they consider a new tax bill this year, lawmakers in Washington could repeat that success. Closer to home, lawmakers in Augusta are considering a smaller but meaningful change to the state level credit, increasing the amount for the most vulnerable kids in our state. 
Instead of submitting a dozen bills to repeal or weaken Maine’s new paid family and medical leave program, Republicans could support the initiative which will allow thousands of Maine parents each year to take time off for childbirth or to care for a sick kid. PFML makes for healthier kids and allows parents (especially moms) to continue participating in the labor force. 
Instead of cheering on the president’s illegal withholding of funds for school meals, and food banks, Maine Republicans could be working to ensure state funding replaces lost federal funds that help the one in five Maine families with kids at risk of going hungry. They could also urge their congressional colleagues not to cut more than a fifth of the funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, in which a third of Maine participating households have children. 
Republicans could also fight to protect health care coverage for Maine kids and parents. Expanding Medicaid coverage has restored coverage to 11,000 parents that lost their eligibility under former Governor Paul LePage’s cuts, but Republicans in Congress are putting that at risk with multiple plans to slash Medicaid funding at the federal level. 
State lawmakers could also support parents by funding child care programs and supporting child care workers. Trump has targeted the Head Start program for cuts, so far withholding $1 billion from states across the country. In Maine, Governor Janet Mills’s budget proposes reducing state support for the program, while also cutting wages for child care workers. Instead of taking away this crucial support for parents, lawmakers can strengthen it, ensuring that workers are paid fairly while keeping programs affordable for parents. 
As any parent will tell you, raising kids is hard. But it’s not difficult to see ways to at least make parenting — and childhood — a bit easier. If Republicans want more babies, they should stop punishing the parents who already have them. Parents don’t need platitudes. They need paid leave, child care they can afford, and food on the table. If politicians can’t deliver that, they should stop pretending to care about families at all.

Court records show that on April 24, a judge granted Sharma-Crawford’s motion for a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration revocation of their legal status as students . On May Wednesday, the judge extended the order to May 21.
Since Trump took office in January, Sharma-Crawford said, she’s seen an “unheard of” number of international students seek her counsel over having their immigration status terminated.
When the federal government notified the students, Sharma-Crawford said, they were told they had been “identified in criminal records” – with no elaboration.
Sharma-Crawford said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that students lost their status without explanation or communication. She said it was done to ultimately harm international students and the universities.
“Here you have somebody who is acting in a completely opaque manner with no transparency impacting people’s schooling, and their liberty and their rights even to go to school without any kind of proper notice, without any kind of proper hearing,” Sharma-Crawford said.

The plaintiffs — who attend Truman State University, Northwest Missouri State University or Southeast Missouri State University or have extended status to continue post-graduation work — in Sharma-Crawford’s lawsuit received notification in April that their Student and Exchange Visitor Program status had been revoked.
In the lawsuit, Sharma-Crawford outlined some reasons the students believe their statuses were revoked for operating a vehicle without a valid driver’s license, a noise complaint, a discontinued felony theft charge, a fleeing charge, an arrest for public intoxication, and traffic violations.
The lawsuit said the students paid all associated fines and had no reason to believe their status would be terminated. None of the potential criminal records, according to Sharma-Crawford, was enough to terminate their visas.
Yanky Perelmuter, an immigration attorney based in Overland Park, said he’s seen the same.
“Almost all of the students I’ve talked to have some underlying petty criminal issue, like speeding tickets, or shoplifting, maybe a DUI,” Perelmuter said.
The Kansas conference of the American Association of University Professors recently condemned the Trump administration’s targeting of college and university international students and scholars. The group asked higher education administrators to stop cooperating with federal investigators by giving them students’ personal information.
The way students found out about their change in immigration status also was problematic, Sharma-Crawford said communication was an issue.
“Students weren’t even getting notifications. Their schools were getting notifications,” Sharma-Crawford said. That robs students of due process, she said.
But, she said, the universities communicated with the students immediately and connected them with legal resources. She said the most important resources universities can provide are for mental health.
“It is critical that they not only have the legal backing but they have the stamina mentally,” Sharma-Crawford said.
Kansas Reflector reached out to every state university — the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, Pittsburg State University, Emporia State University, Wichita State University and Fort Hays State University — as well as Washburn University, and asked how many international students had their status terminated and what support was provided. Most of the universities did not respond, but Fort Hays and Pittsburg State said they’re monitoring the issue and are connecting students with resources.
Sharma-Crawford said she wasn’t surprised that most of the universities didn’t respond. She said the Trump administration uses fear and intimidation as a tactic to scare universities and international students.
“It’s hindering them from wanting to be here or come here,” Sharma-Crawford said. “I think, in some ways, that’s the plan. Because if you can economically harm the universities, then the universities will bend to your will.”
Sharma-Crawford said one of the cruelest parts of this is the timing. The students were notified of termination roughly one month before finals. She said the stress of it caused some students to immediately leave the country without seeking legal help. Sharma-Crawford encouraged any affected student to seek individualized legal help.

In 2022, there were 29 library title challenges in the state, according to the American Library Association. That number more than quadrupled the following year, reaching 117 in 2023.
The Accountability Project paired up with Connecticut Public state government reporter Michayla Savitt to explore the topic.
We interviewed librarians, parents and state lawmakers, and sifted through hundreds of school board meeting minutes.
We found books that spark controversy in Connecticut are often intended for young readers, and discuss themes of gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual education, race and racism.
In one example, at the Cragin Memorial Library in Colchester, a patron filed a petition in 2022 against the book “Who is RuPaul?”, which was on display for Pride Month, a celebration of the impact lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have had in the United States and beyond. The book is part of a popular children’s biography series meant for kids ages 9 to 12.
The book was eventually put back on the shelves. But similar challenges have become more frequent, and the process of evaluating literature differs from one community to the next.

In response, Connecticut lawmakers have explored creating a more uniform approach. One bill, which is in committee, would immunize librarians from civil and criminal liability stemming from challenges to library materials.
Another bill would require all libraries to create a process to handle book petitions or challenges. Under the measure, a title couldn’t be removed solely because someone finds it offensive. Books would also be protected from additional challenges for three years if an attempt to have them removed fails.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, a Norwalk Democrat, helped introduce that measure. The legislation might make it easier to track exactly how many books are being challenged in the state.
State Republicans have proposed other provisions, saying minors shouldn’t be able to access materials that have sexually explicit content or nudity.
“We’re not trying to ban books,” state Sen. Henri Martin, a Bristol Republican, said in an exchange at a February public hearing. “What we’re trying to do is protect our children.”

The American Library Association, a nonprofit that promotes libraries and library education, tracks efforts to ban or restrict access to reading materials nationally. To collect that information, it relies on news stories and reports from individual librarians.
That means some attempts to take books off the shelves can be missed.
Some librarians won’t report book bans out of fear, said Jenny Lussier, president of the Connecticut Association of School Librarians. Some school librarians in Connecticut have received threats for doing so, she added.
“We’re all professionals,” Lussier said. “We all want what’s best for our kids.”

Over the past decade, a Minnesota program called Early Learning Scholarships has awarded over 100,000 child care scholarships to families in desperate need.
State leaders who made that possible don’t often get to hear how that impacts those children and families. To them, it’s just another number on another spreadsheet.
If they did hear all of those stories, I bet they wouldn’t be on the verge of cutting scholarship funding. If the Legislature and Gov. Tim Walz don’t take action, about $100 million will be cut from the Early Learning Scholarship program. If this cut happens, the long-term effects on families and Minnesota would be disastrous. 
That’s why I am sharing my story.  
Scholarships literally changed the lives of me and my daughter Oaklyn.  
Early Learning Scholarships empower low-income families with babies, toddlers and preschoolers to access high-quality child care and preschool programs. These are the kinds of programs that get kids ready for kindergarten and everything that comes after. There is no way my daughter Oaklyn could have benefited from such a program without scholarships. We simply couldn’t have come close to affording it. 
Here’s our situation: Like millions of Americans, I have struggled with addiction and an abusive marriage. When I was pregnant with Oaklyn, I stayed sober. After she was born, I relapsed. My absolute rock bottom came when Child Protective Services took Oaklyn away from me.  
When that happened, I knew I needed help. My CPS case manager connected me with Wayside Recovery Center, where I started my recovery journey. Thank goodness for them, too. 
As I was going through treatment, Oaklyn and I were living in a shelter. Shelter staff encouraged me to apply for an Early Learning Scholarship. I was thrilled when I learned that we qualified and had been awarded a scholarship that we could use at any high-quality early learning program of our choosing! 
We chose Rise Early Learning Center, a four-star Parent Aware-rated child care program that is co-located in a housing complex in St. Louis Park. Beyond early learning for Oaklyn, Rise also helped me with support for toilet training, nutrition and other parenting challenges. They’ve helped Oaklyn communicate about the big emotions that she was feeling, and her vocabulary has grown so much.
At the same time, having Oaklyn in child care during the day allowed me to take care of the things I needed to take care of, and be more present with Oaklyn and treasure our time together. That part was huge, too. 
Because of the scholarship, I’ve been able to further my education. I’m working toward my certification as a Licensed Alcohol and Drug Counselor through Minneapolis Community and Technical College. I’m not quite there yet, but I can now see a clear path to financial independence and being a constructive part of my community. 
I can’t tell you how much it meant to me to have access to early learning help for Oaklyn and non-judgmental parenting advice for me. That’s happening because of Rise, but access to Rise is happening because of scholarships. And Early Learning Scholarships are happening because of the Legislature and governor. 
The Legislature is facing a difficult budget situation. I get that. I really do. But it breaks my heart to think that tens of thousands of little kids like Oaklyn could lose this opportunity for a much better life.  
Because Oaklyn and I are getting this amazing help now, I firmly believe that taxpayers won’t have to pay for as many expensive services to support us in the future. As great as scholarships have been for us, that seems like a good deal for taxpayers, too. 
Whatever happens with the budget this year, I wanted to wholeheartedly thank state legislators and Gov. Tim Walz for making a scholarship available to Oaklyn. It is changing the trajectory of her life. 
I just shared one life-changing story, but you have it within your grasp to empower another 15,000 other stories like ours every single year. That’s what funding Early Learning Scholarships for all eligible families would do. 
I hope you can find a way to do that for other great kids like Oaklyn.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/D753AC86-F1DD-456D-BA50-EDD802758461-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-12 11:12:31.759657

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Auditor Rob Sand, the only Democrat to currently hold statewide office in Iowa, announced his campaign for governor Monday.
Sand was widely expected to run for the position as a Democratic nominee, having raised more than $8 million in the 2024 calendar year, according to the Des Moines Register. But Sand is facing a different playing field for governor than predicted heading into the 2026 election cycle: Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she will not seek reelection in 2026, meaning Republicans are also facing an open primary in the gubernatorial race.
Several Republican elected officials, including Attorney General Brenna Bird, House Speaker Pat Grassley and U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra have said they are considering a campaign for governor. Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, has launched an exploratory committee for the governor’s race, and former state Rep. Brad Sherman entered the race in February, before Reynolds’ announcement.
While other Democrats may join the race for governor, Sand is considered a top contender to become the Democratic nominee. Though not competing against an incumbent could be favorable in the race, Sand and Democrats still must win over Iowa voters who have overwhelmingly elected Republicans in recent state and federal elections. Iowa’s congressional delegation is entirely Republican, and GOP supermajorities were elected in 2024 for both chambers of the Legislature. All statewide elected officials other than Sand are Republicans.
In a news release announcing his campaign, Sand said Iowa families and communities are falling behind because current elected leaders “aren’t focused on the issues that matter most.” He said he would bring his experience working as state auditor to the governor’s office to improve government accountability and work across the aisle to make improvements to the state.
“I’ve spent my career fighting for Iowans – locking up corrupt public officials, violent criminals, scammers, and thieves, rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse, and holding members of both parties accountable,” Sand said in a statement. “Now, I’m taking my fight to the governor’s office to serve all Iowans by lowering costs, continuing to make government accountable to taxpayers, and working with both parties to create more opportunities to help Iowa families not just get by, but thrive and live healthy lives.”
Sand, 42, was first elected as state auditor in 2018, defeating former state auditor Mary Mosiman, the Republican incumbent. He gained prominence working previously as assistant attorney general under former Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, prosecuting cases including the Hot Lotto fraud case, a lottery rigging scandal.
He was reelected as auditor in 2022, retaining his position during an election cycle when several Democratic incumbents — including Miller, Iowa Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald and U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne — were defeated by Republican challengers.
Sand has repeatedly clashed with Republican leaders as auditor over issues like accessing information related to management of the Education Savings Account program providing public funding for private school costs, and Reynolds’ use of some federal COVID money before it had been officially allocated. Most recently, GOP state lawmakers on the House Government Oversight Committee questioned Sand about why his office had not more quickly identified or reported on the misallocation of $27.5 million in court debt funds between fiscal years 2021 and 2024 caused by coding errors.
Both Republican leaders and Sand have accused one another of pursuing these actions for political purposes. Sand has also criticized the GOP-controlled Legislature for passing laws restricting the auditor’s office from accessing certain information and limiting the office’s ability to file subpoenas against state government entities in order to access information, instead sending disputes to a three-member board of arbitration.
Sand said in a video posted to social media Monday that current leadership in Iowa state government serves “special interests and insiders,” saying he would instead focus on ensuring the government serves all Iowans.
“I’m doing it because we need more public service and less politics,” Sand said. “A lot of politicians yap about making a place redder or bluer — I want Iowa to be better and truer.”
Republican Governors Association Communications Director Courtney Alexander criticized Sand as an “extreme liberal” in a statement Monday.
“Democrats’ media darling Rob Sand is just another extreme liberal, supporting guys playing in girls’ sports and opposing President Trump’s agenda. Sand would turn Iowa into Tim Walz’s Minnesota: higher taxes and radical liberal values,” Alexander said in a statement. “Iowans want a governor who will protect their values and tax dollars, not one who needs his rich family to be named the ‘Influencer of Iowa Democrats’ by the New York Times.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/sand.judicial1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 11:12:31.759657

A new nationwide study reveals significant disparities in pet healthcare across the United States, with Colorado emerging as the best state for veterinary care and Delaware ranking last.
The analysis, conducted by Your Service Animal, underscores how factors such as emergency clinic access, veterinarian availability, and care costs vary dramatically depending on location — with real consequences for pets and their owners.
The report evaluated all 50 states using a composite Pet Healthcare Quality Score, which combined metrics including the number of licensed veterinarians per 100,000 residents, availability of 24/7 emergency clinics, average costs of care, and pet insurance rates.
Colorado secured the top spot thanks to a balanced combination of high vet availability, robust emergency services, and above-average insurance coverage.

Delaware’s pet healthcare ranking
Delaware received a score of 0.00 — the lowest possible — due to a severe lack of emergency clinics, a low number of vets, and minimal pet insurance coverage among residents.
“Pet owners often don’t realize how much their location affects their ability to get quality care for their animals until it’s too late,” says Nick Jordan, Founder of Your Service Animal. “Understanding these disparities helps families make better decisions about their pets’ health needs.”
Delaware’s shortcomings are especially stark.
The state has no 24/7 emergency veterinary clinics, only 38.11 veterinarians per 100,000 residents, and a pet insurance rate of just 0.4%. Combined with relatively high routine care costs ($78.95), the situation forces many pet owners to travel out of state for urgent treatment, creating potentially life-threatening delays.
The study also challenges assumptions about urban-rural divides.
“Delaware’s situation highlights how geographic factors can create healthcare deserts even in smaller states,” Jordan said. “Pet owners there often need to cross state lines for emergency care, creating dangerous delays in treatment.”
While rural areas are often associated with limited access to services, states like Wyoming and Vermont performed well, largely due to their high number of veterinarians per capita. Wyoming, for instance, has no emergency clinics but leads the nation with 130.95 veterinarians per 100,000 residents.
The relationship between cost and care quality also proved inconsistent.
States like New York and Illinois rank near the bottom despite high veterinary costs, whereas Nebraska, with lower average costs, ranked seventh overall.
“Our findings reveal how drastically pet healthcare quality varies across America,” Jordan said. “When pets lack access to timely care, preventable conditions often become emergencies, which results in higher costs and worse outcomes. For those in low-ranking states, I advise establishing a relationship with a primary vet before emergencies occur, researching the nearest 24/7 facilities (even across state lines), building an emergency fund, and considering pet insurance to manage costs.”
As more Americans welcome pets into their homes, the study highlights the importance of equitable access to veterinary care — and the need for pet owners to understand the unique challenges their state might present.

(Photo by Getty Images)A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to change oversight of child welfare in Maine to mirror the approach taken by its neighboring state.
Assistant House Majority Leader Lori Gramlich, an Old Orchard Beach Democrat, said she modeled her bill after the New Hampshire Office of the Child Advocate. LD 1893, which has two Republican and seven Democrat co-sponsors, would transfer Maine’s existing child welfare ombudsman into a new, independent agency with expanding responsibilities to advocate for Maine children.
The proposed Office of Child Advocate would have the authority to receive complaints, access information, investigate, make public reports, and advise the executive and legislative branches on how best to provide services to the state’s youth.
“This bill builds a foundation for meaningful oversight and reform while ensuring children’s voices and interests remain at the forefront,” Gramlich told the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee during a public hearing Friday morning.
After renewed scrutiny in recent years, there have been multiple proposals from lawmakers and agency leadership to improve the state’s embattled child welfare system. Last year, frontline workers came forward with accounts of onerous workloads that culminated in December with a letter of no confidence in the agency’s leadership.
The proposed restructuring comes after the committee backed a proposal to update the state’s definition of child abuse and neglect that legal experts have argued is easy to conflate with poverty.
Christine Alberi, the state’s current child welfare ombudsman, supports the bill to transition her position into an Office of Child Advocate because it preserves the work her office is already doing while adding “necessary functions.” For example, the new office would allow for juvenile justice investigations and access to facilities such as Long Creek Youth Development Center, the South Portland-based youth correctional facility.
However, Alberi said that adequate funding would be crucial to the office’s success. During the hearing, she said it wasn’t clear where those resources would come from, since the ombudsman office has struggled with a lack of funding for staff since 2012.
The current child welfare ombudsman program in Maine operates as a nonprofit that assists and investigates complaints against how child protective services cases are handled. It submits an annual report that includes an analysis of case specific reviews and other details about its interaction with the Office of Child and Family Services.
Having served as New Hampshire’s first child advocate, Moira O’Neill said she believes Maine could have avoided a lawsuit with the U.S. Department of Justice over the state’s children’s behavioral health services had there been a proactive resource checking on the children in the care of the Department of Corrections. The suit was settled last November.
O’Neill, who helped craft the model in New Hampshire before stepping down in 2021, supported Maine adopting that structure. She said Maine’s current ombudsman office leaves many children, especially those in the juvenile justice system, without an ally.
Republican lawmakers in New Hampshire have expressed interest in cutting the Office of Child Advocate when looking for ways to trim the state budget.
Gramlich said the Office of the Attorney General suggested modest amendments to the bill that she is happy to work with the committee to incorporate.
The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the state’s child welfare agency, spoke neither for nor against the bill. Director of Government Relations Abby Stivers said the department would like more time to review the proposal, but cautioned that the new framework being proposed likely requires more consideration than the department can give it in the remaining time for this legislative session.
Stivers said the authority granted to the child advocate in this legislation could be wide reaching and questioned whether it is necessary given the multiple forms of oversight that already exist for child welfare services. The agency is subject to federal oversight, multiple citizen review panels and was subject to extensive investigative work from the Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee last session.
However, Sen. Joe Baldacci, a Penobscot Democrat, reintroduced a bill he brought forth last session to create an Office of the Inspector General of Child Protection.
“The problems with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services are going to require far more than cosmetic surgery being suggested by some,” he told the committee when introducing LD 770.
An inspector general at the state level would send a “clear and articulate message” that the accountability and transparency of Maine’s child welfare system needs to be substantially changed, Baldacci said. He referenced a 2024 report from the federal watchdog that indicated Maine struggled to comply with best practices in the vast majority of abuse and neglect cases.
Under this proposal, the inspector general would be appointed by the governor to serve a five year term, with the potential for reappointment. It would also take on matters related to juvenile justice and have subpoena powers.
No one from the public testified on the bill. Bobbi Johnson, director of the Office of Child and Family Services, provided written testimony opposing the legislation. She wrote that it isn’t clear what benefit the role would offer to the “robust and comprehensive oversight of child welfare that already exists.”
The proposal last session ultimately died after it was not endorsed by the Health and Human Services Committee.

Robby Robbins, R-Summerville. (Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Finding and convicting people downloading child pornography could become easier in South Carolina.
A bill heading to the governor’s desk allows the state Attorney General’s Office to subpoena websites and internet providers to locate people suspected of accessing child pornography.
Attorney General Alan Wilson called the bill unanimously approved in both chambers a “game changer” for his office.
“It will make it so much easier to go after child predators online,” Wilson told reporters Friday.
According to Wilson, his office has made about 3,000 arrests for internet sex crimes since his tenure began in 2011.
The cases can be delayed for weeks, sometimes even months, as state prosecutors wait for court authority to get the information needed to track down suspects, he said.
The bill would enable the task force to get that information in a day or two if it relates to internet sex crimes.
“It’s going to cut the time down tremendously for going after people who are preying on children online,” said Wilson, who’s been advocating for this proposal for at least three years.
The new authority applies only to subpoenas issued by the Attorney General’s Office in cases investigated by the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.
Ensuring that the bill was specific about that was crucial, said Sen. Matthew Leber, a co-sponsor of the proposal.
“We wanted to address the problem at hand and not create unintended consequences,” the Johns Island Republican told the SC Daily Gazette.
Another co-sponsor is Sen. Jason Elliott, a former prosecutor in Anderson and Greenville counties.
This bill is “a vital step in protecting children,” said the Greenville Republican.
Gov. Henry McMaster is expected to sign the legislation.
When he does, “we’ll be able to get to work and use this to better serve our state,” Wilson said.
SC AG seeks law criminalizing ‘artificial’ child pornography

Also expected to be signed into law are two bills criminalizing the use of technology to create child pornography — whether using actual or computer-generated photos of children. Both received final approval by the Legislature last week after similar bills fell short in 2024.
“We have to catch the laws up,” Wilson told reporters. “When they were writing child exploitation laws, no one ever dreamed that you could create children, or morph images of innocent children into these types of pictures and videos.”
Wilson is expected to be among candidates running for governor in 2026, though he hasn’t officially made a decision. One could be coming in the “not too distant future,” he told reporters Friday.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, another likely candidate, has repeatedly claimed that Wilson doesn’t do enough to prosecute child predators.
The attorney general responded to the criticisms Saturday, referring to Mace only as a “would-be candidate” for governor.
His response on X included advocating for the bills soon to be law. He also says he quadrupled the size of the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.
“Enough is enough,” he wrote. “I won’t allow someone to use lies, misinformation, and half truths (at best) to cast a negative light on hardworking men and women of law enforcement.”
The 1st District congresswoman followed up with another criticism, writing on X that “when predators walk free, that’s on him. The buck stops at Alan Wilson. Period.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4587-scaled-1-1024x587.jpg,,,2025-05-12 11:12:31.759657

Hill City had hoped to use Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities funding for a floodplain study of the creek. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Drinking water upgrades for Mobridge, efficiency boosting software systems for Rapid City and a tornado shelter for Chancellor are among the South Dakota projects that now count as formerly funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
FEMA announced the axing of its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grant program last month in a press release lambasting the Biden-era creation as “wasteful” and “politicized.”
The 2021 program aimed to direct $1 billion in funding toward infrastructure projects to help communities across the U.S. “reduce their hazard risk” as they “build capability and capacity.”


Federal Fallout
Go to the Federal Fallout page for Searchlight coverage of Trump administration firings, funding freezes, spending cuts, grant cancellations, tariffs and immigration enforcement.


The press release from the Trump administration’s incarnation of FEMA says all awards from 2020 through 2024 are rescinded, and that all the money that hasn’t been distributed won’t be. The unspent $882 million will flow into the U.S. Treasury or be reallocated by Congress, the release says.
FEMA falls under the leadership of Homeland Security Secretary and former South Dakota governor Kristi Noem. 
The program “was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters,” the FEMA release says. “Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, we are committed to ensuring that Americans in crisis can get the help and resources they need.”
The South Dakota Democratic Party issued a press release of its own on the cessation of the grant program, one trashing Noem’s agency and Trump’s policies as damaging to South Dakota communities.
“Because of these cuts, city and county leaders will now have to scramble to either figure out where the rest of the money will come from, or ditch their projects altogether, leaving their communities vulnerable to disasters” wrote Shane Merrill, chair of the state party.
According to a tally of federal cuts compiled and updated weekly by the administration of Noem’s successor, Gov. Larry Rhoden, $8.9 million in South Dakota projects were set to benefit from BRIC grants. Based on South Dakota Searchlight calls to local governments involved in the projects, it’s unclear if that total figure represents the amount of grant money lost, or the total project costs including other funding sources. 
Mobridge water treatment
Some BRIC money was collected and spent before the shuttering of the program. The city of Mobridge got $311,000 for phase one of a three-phase project to replace the piping that delivers Missouri River water from Lake Oahe to the city’s water treatment plant on its way to residents’ taps.
That first round of BRIC money paid for engineering, planning and a dive team survey, all undertaken in preparation of the second round of BRIC funding, which Mobridge Finance Officer Heather Beck said would’ve set the physical piping upgrade portion of the project in motion. 
“We had been told by the FEMA folks that if phase one is awarded, they had never seen the second phase not get awarded,” Beck said.
The anticipated grant assistance with the pipe rebuild was a boon to Mobridge’s larger $11.2 million drinking water project. Water bills paid by the north-central South Dakota community’s residents are enough to keep the city “self-sustaining” for the most part, Beck said, but the cost of major upgrades can be a heavy one to spread around.










We had been told by the FEMA folks that if phase one is awarded, they had never seen the second phase not get awarded.


– Heather Beck, Mobridge city finance officer


“With only 3,200 people, it takes more from them to be able to pay for these projects,” Beck said.
The city’s on the lookout for more state or federal funding sources now, Beck said. The city had taken in some grant funding from the American Rescue Plan Act for the wider water treatment project already, but “a lot of that $11.2 million has had to be borrowed.”
City leadership has reached out to South Dakota’s congressional delegation in hopes that some of the grant funding can be restored through a program that’s not shuttered.
Mobridge’s nearly $4 million BRIC-funded project, with grant funding passed through to the city by Walworth County, was the largest project on the $8.9 million list of grant-supported projects in South Dakota. The city was set to pay 20% of the cost, meaning it lost out on about $3.2 million.
Rapid City building codes, tornado shelters
The project with the second-highest price tag on the state’s tally of lost grant funding was $2.6 million. That project was meant to help Rapid City cover the labor costs of updating its fire codes, pay for software that would allow citizens or companies to submit documents like building permits or developer plans online, and to upgrade its computing systems to connect departments and avoid duplicate work between departments managing development and permitting. 
A letter from Mayor Jason Salamun to the U.S. Senate majority leader, South Dakota Republican John Thune, says the work aligns “with the priorities of the Trump-Vance administration.”

“Our project was specifically designed to enhance operational efficiency within our local government, ultimately saving taxpayer dollars and reducing administrative burdens for both city staff and the general public, including housing developers,” the letter reads.
Rapid City’s share of the project was $623,093; the BRIC program was set to cover a little under a million dollars. 
The city also hoped to create an inventory of potentially hazardous buildings, although Grants Division Manager Jamie Toennies said decisions on what the city might do to address those buildings would come later.
“Opportunities are there to proactively keep the buildings from getting in worse shape,” she said.
The city is on the lookout for more funding sources, Toennies said, as “we had identified this need before this grant.”
The third-largest South Dakota project was $485,973 for the town of Chancellor, home to 316 people and one large ethanol production plant. According to a map of FEMA-funded mitigation projects maintained by the state, the town was in line for BRIC support of a severe wind and tornado shelter. 
Hill City, a city of around 1,000 in Pennington County, had asked for, but wasn’t awarded, money for a floodplain study of Spring Creek, which runs through town. Finance Officer Stacia Tallon said the federal share of the $167,200 project would have helped the city determine where to put replacement box culverts to mitigate flood risk, and to map out areas that might be safe for building.
The box culvert piece of the project in particular is still necessary, Tallon said, although it’s unclear when or how the city will be able to move forward with the plans.
“We’re still looking at them, but they’ve been kind of put on the back burner,” Tallon said.

Photo courtesy of the Williston ObserverThis story by Jason Starr was first published in the Williston Observer on May 8.Hey, let’s start a school newspaper!Those maybe aren’t words you’d expect to hear from high-schoolers in the mid-2020s, but that’s exactly what the three founders of The Hawks’ Nest have done this school year at CVU.Not since 2008 has the high school had a news source readers could physically hold and thumb through. A journalism class produced an online news site in recent years, but even that went dark at the end of last school year. Enter juniors Grace Warrington, Karmen Wilbur and Lily Gruber, three friends from Shelburne, Williston and Charlotte, respectively, who nurtured a vision of a new student-run print newspaper through last spring and summer. By fall, they had lined up an out-of-state printer and distribution plan, and in October published the premier issue of The Hawks’ Nest. They’ve since published four other issues.“We knew from the start we wanted to do print,” Wilbur said. “It’s important that people are able to actually pick it up … It’s more likely to be read. With online papers, you have to go out of your way to find them.”The paper is available in the cafeteria and library, as well as put in teachers’ mailboxes for them to distribute to their homeroom students. Wilbur recalls seeing a classmate discover The Hawks’ Nest for the first time. “I saw someone pick it up and start reading it and be like, ‘Oh, this is cool.’ I was like, ‘Oh my God, I had a hand in making that. And now I get to watch you enjoy it.’ … We’ve put so much work into it, and it has been just so cool to see people reading it.”Operating as a journalism club with a mostly hands-off faculty advisor, The Hawks’ Nest staff has grown to about seven writers, with coverage of sports, academic and arts events, staff profiles, opinion pieces and school policy news. For the current issue, Warrington wrote Part 1 of a definitive history of CVU school newspapers, with interviews of graduates from the 1970s who recall the days of the school’s original newspaper, The Clarion (1964-1972), and its successor The Cow Valley Press (1972-1979). The Hawks’ Nest will publish Part 2 of that history, written by Wilbur, in its final issue of the school year later this month. “We think it is important for a high school to have a school newspaper because it is an excellent way to build community and hear everyone’s voices and diverse opinions, along with giving students a chance to practice their journalistic skills,” Warrington, as editor-in-chief, wrote in the paper’s inaugural edition in October.Faculty advisor Justin Chapman added: “It’s a civic necessity. It’s integral to the functioning of any democratic institution, including and especially public schools … There’s a reason Jefferson referred to the press as the fourth pillar of American Democracy.”Publishing the paper has brought the founding trio closer together as friends. It’s also given them career skills and leadership experience. “It’s a way students can collaborate together to make something,” Warrington said. “I also think it’s important that students are given a chance to give their own perspectives on what’s happening in their school and what’s happening in the world, too.”The challenge of continuity of a school newspaper, with staff constantly moving on through graduation, is illustrated in the rise and fall of former CVU papers: The Clarion, The Cow Valley Press, The Crusader, the Champlain Valley Chronicle. If The Hawks’ Nest is to continue for more than another year, Wilbur, Warrington and Gruber will have to find underclass editors to take the reins. “I’d love to get some of the incoming freshmen to help because obviously we need to pass it on,” Warrington said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Press on: Students launch CVU newspaper.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Hawks-Nest-1024x419.jpg,,,2025-05-12 11:12:31.759657

That said, there are sound and accurate ways to do this important work that keep things up to date without disenfranchising voters who may simply have skipped an election or two — and as a new report from researchers at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice shows, this is an area in which North Carolina officials can and should do a better job.
Fortunately, as Newsline’s Rob Schofield was reminded in a recent conversation with the Southern Coalition’s senior voting rights counsel Hilary Harris Klein, the solutions in this area aren’t terribly complex and many are largely just a function of providing adequate funding to state and county election officials to hire necessary staff and purchase 21st century computer systems.

Courtesy of Minnesota House Public Information Services.Welcome to The Topline, a weekly roundup of the big numbers driving the Minnesota news cycle, as well as the smaller ones that you might have missed. This week: what’s in the Senate’s $365 million tax omnibus; a record-high graduation rate; the summer air quality outlook; and tallying the attorney general’s lawsuits against the Trump administration.
What’s in the Senate tax omnibus
Last week the Senate Tax Committee approved an omnibus tax bill with $365 million in new revenue over the next biennium. About $315 million of that figure comes from new taxes, with the remainder coming primarily from the expiration of various tax aids and credits.
A new tax on large social media companies accounts for the lion’s share of the proposed new revenue and would generate $138 million in the next biennium, according to Senate analysts’ estimates. 
The bill would also raise the rate of the net investment income tax from 1.0% to 1.5%, generating $74 million. That tax applies to investment income exceeding $1 million.
Another provision would reduce the maximum operating loss deduction in the corporate franchise tax, bringing in another $62 million.
About $40 million in additional revenue would come from reducing aid to local and county governments.
The bill still needs to pass the full Senate and undergo reconciliation with the House tax bill. Republicans, who share control of the Minnesota House, and allied groups oppose higher taxes — since in this case they’re not called “tariffs” — and have been critical of the Senate bill. So it’s unclear how many of these provisions will make it all the way through to the desk of Gov. Tim Walz. 
Lawmakers are also eyeing $300 million in cuts to the human services budget as the state attempts to forestall future budget deficits.
High school graduation rate hits new record
The Walz administration and teachers’ groups cheered the release last week of new data showing the statewide high school graduation rate edged to its highest level on record. The rate increased from 83.3% in 2023 to 84.2% in 2024, or nearly a full percentage point. It’s the highest rate on record, and the largest year-over-year increase in a decade.
“The graduation data show increases for students in the American Indian, Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latino and white student groups,” the Minnesota Department of Education noted. “Graduation rates also increased for English learners, students from low-income families, and students receiving special education services.”
The graduation rate among Asian and Hispanic students increased by about 2.5 percentage points, as did the rate among all students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. English learners posted the biggest year-over-year increase at 3.9 percentage points. 
Relative to 2020, the graduation rate among Indigenous and Black students increased by roughly 4.5 percentage points.
This aligns with a 2019 Walz goal to raise graduation rates. 
Staggering racial disparities remain, however. While nearly 90% of white students graduated, fewer than two thirds of Indigenous pupils did. The rate for Black and Hispanic students is closer to 75%.
“These Minnesota students overcame the disruptions and distractions of a global pandemic and a national racial reckoning after the murder of George Floyd to graduate at the highest rate on record,” said outgoing Education Minnesota president Denise Specht. “It’s remarkable, and a testament to the resilience of the students and the quality of instruction and support they received from their educators and families.” 
While the improvement in the graduation rate is welcome, data released at the beginning of the school year shows that student achievement still lags well behind the pre-pandemic levels, and in some cases continues to fall.
Summer ozone levels expected to be slightly above historic averages
Forecasters with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency expect outdoor ozone levels to be unhealthy for sensitive groups between four and seven days this summer, slightly above average. 
The agency also expects 12 to 16 days of wildfire smoke impacts, up from last summer’s forecast of five to seven expected alerts.
MPCA will also begin issuing alerts for PM10, which covers airborne particles larger than those that make up wildfire smoke. It’s typically caused by blowing dust, which is an issue in agricultural areas between fall and spring, when topsoil can get blown off bare fields.
The agency issues regular air quality updates and forecasts on its website.
Keith Ellison has sued the Trump administration 22 times
The Star Tribune recently launched an ongoing tally of Attorney General Keith Ellison’s lawsuits against the Trump administration. The tally so far is 22, most of which were filed in conjunction with the attorneys general of a handful of other states.
The lawsuits cover everything from the administration’s anti-transgender actions to the abrupt cancellation of various types of grant funding to Elon Musk’s allegedly improper influence over the workings of the federal government.
All of the lawsuits are currently open.

While farming first brought him into the agriculture world, 802Logging founder Seth Robillard cut his own path to success in the woods.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  802Logging: From family farm to forestry enterprise.","“If VEDA financing weren’t an option, the landscape would be drastically different for my business,” Robillard said. While farming first brought him into the agriculture world, 802Logging founder Seth Robillard cut his own path to success in the woods. Growing up on Robillard Brother’s Farm, run by his parents and grandparents, he learned early on about operating heavy equipment and the value of hard work. At just 15 years old, Robillard and his brothers took over the farm and continued farming for several years. Making ends meet became increasingly difficult, and Robillard, determined to discover his own path, embarked on a new journey. He launched 802Logging, LLC on Jan. 1, 2018. His logging operation quickly expanded to include firewood sales and, eventually, composting services. This diversification was crucial in providing a steady income stream, especially during the dreaded mud season. As most loggers can attest, business is continually at the mercy of Mother Nature and machinery. VEDA came into the picture as Robillard was looking to purchase a feller buncher, a machine similar to an excavator but equipped with a saw head and accumulating fingers. Without it, he would need to hire custom operators, which would be a huge expense and logistical challenge. Owning the machine would save time and money. It would allow him to cut smaller amounts of wood at a time, critical during warm winter days when freeze-thaw cycles could potentially ruin inventory. For Robillard, the VEDA connection was personal. His partner, Nicole, went to college with loan officer Andy Wood. Adding fellow loan officer Colleen Leonard into the equation led to a five-year loan that significantly boosted efficiencies within the business. “If VEDA financing weren’t an option, the landscape would be drastically different for my business,” Robillard said. “The terms of the loan were instrumental in purchasing the feller buncher, and without it, our ability to secure a working lands grant would have been non-existent.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  802Logging: From family farm to forestry enterprise.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VEDA_SS-0513251-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 10:12:18.157936

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Immigration attorney Rekha Sharma-Crawford filed a federal lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s attempts to block five international students from their college educations — and so far, she’s winning.
Court records show that on April 24, a judge granted Sharma-Crawford’s motion for a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration revocation of their legal status as students . On May Wednesday, the judge extended the order to May 21.
Since Trump took office in January, Sharma-Crawford said, she’s seen an “unheard of” number of international students seek her counsel over having their immigration status terminated.
When the federal government notified the students, Sharma-Crawford said, they were told they had been “identified in criminal records” – with no elaboration.
Sharma-Crawford said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that students lost their status without explanation or communication. She said it was done to ultimately harm international students and the universities.
“Here you have somebody who is acting in a completely opaque manner with no transparency impacting people’s schooling, and their liberty and their rights even to go to school without any kind of proper notice, without any kind of proper hearing,” Sharma-Crawford said.


The plaintiffs — who attend Truman State University, Northwest Missouri State University or Southeast Missouri State University or have extended status to continue post-graduation work — in Sharma-Crawford’s lawsuit received notification in April that their Student and Exchange Visitor Program status had been revoked.
In the lawsuit, Sharma-Crawford outlined some reasons the students believe their statuses were revoked for operating a vehicle without a valid driver’s license, a noise complaint, a discontinued felony theft charge, a fleeing charge, an arrest for public intoxication, and traffic violations.
The lawsuit said the students paid all associated fines and had no reason to believe their status would be terminated. None of the potential criminal records, according to Sharma-Crawford, was enough to terminate their visas.
Yanky Perelmuter, an immigration attorney based in Overland Park, said he’s seen the same.
“Almost all of the students I’ve talked to have some underlying petty criminal issue, like speeding tickets, or shoplifting, maybe a DUI,” Perelmuter said.
The Kansas conference of the American Association of University Professors recently condemned the Trump administration’s targeting of college and university international students and scholars. The group asked higher education administrators to stop cooperating with federal investigators by giving them students’ personal information.
The way students found out about their change in immigration status also was problematic, Sharma-Crawford said communication was an issue.
“Students weren’t even getting notifications. Their schools were getting notifications,” Sharma-Crawford said. That robs students of due process, she said.
But, she said, the universities communicated with the students immediately and connected them with legal resources. She said the most important resources universities can provide are for mental health.
“It is critical that they not only have the legal backing but they have the stamina mentally,” Sharma-Crawford said.
Kansas Reflector reached out to every state university — the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, Pittsburg State University, Emporia State University, Wichita State University and Fort Hays State University — as well as Washburn University, and asked how many international students had their status terminated and what support was provided. Most of the universities did not respond, but Fort Hays and Pittsburg State said they’re monitoring the issue and are connecting students with resources.
Sharma-Crawford said she wasn’t surprised that most of the universities didn’t respond. She said the Trump administration uses fear and intimidation as a tactic to scare universities and international students.
“It’s hindering them from wanting to be here or come here,” Sharma-Crawford said. “I think, in some ways, that’s the plan. Because if you can economically harm the universities, then the universities will bend to your will.”
Sharma-Crawford said one of the cruelest parts of this is the timing. The students were notified of termination roughly one month before finals. She said the stress of it caused some students to immediately leave the country without seeking legal help. Sharma-Crawford encouraged any affected student to seek individualized legal help.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rekha-Sharma-Crawford-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-12 10:12:18.157936

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Just 140 miles south of the Arctic Circle, far from any major industrial or population centers, Alaska’s second-largest city has struggled for decades with some of the nation’s worst winter air pollution.
Now years of work to clear particulate pollution from the air in the Fairbanks North Star Borough, the approximately 7,500-square mile district encompassing the city of Fairbanks and its outskirts, is paying off.
At issue are the pollutants known as Particulate Matter 2.5, minute particles no bigger than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. Less than 5% the width of a typical human hair, they are health hazards. They can become embedded in the lungs and even pass through respiratory membranes to get into the bloodstream and body organs.
Since 2015, levels of those fine particulates – the majority of which has come from wood-burning stoves – have been roughly cut in half during the worst winter air-quality days.
“We have made tremendous strides in reducing PM 2.5 in the area, and I think that’s something that needs to be acknowledged,” said Steven Hoke, the borough’s air quality manager.

	Fairbanks North Star Borough Mayor Grier Hopkins remembers past decades, when clunker vehicles filled the streets and poured smoky pollution into the air. That problem has largely been addressed by improved automobile technology and the diligent use of plug-in block heaters that improve engines’ efficiency in cold weather. He also remembers old boilers that belched smoke, causing some to drift from the outdoor air into school hallways and classrooms. Those boilers have disappeared, and the difference is dramatic, he said.
“While we can have the reputation of some of the worst air in the nation, it doesn’t feel like that when you’re here,” Hopkins said. “I would argue it feels a lot cleaner here when I’m walking around than if I’m in Los Angeles on a smoggy day or something like that.”
An important milestone came in the last days of the Biden administration, when the Environmental Protection Agency gave its blessing to the state’s air plan for the Fairbanks North Star Borough. The tentative approval of what is known as the State Implementation Plan, or SIP, means that the borough will likely not face any additional air-quality related restrictions on construction or development at least until 2027.
 

  Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation data shows how particulate pollution in downtown Fairbanks has been reduced over time. Prior to 2006, the threshold for daily air-quality violations was 65 micrograms per cubic meter. The standard was tightened in 2006 to 35 micrograms per cubic meter. (Graph provided by Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation)

	There are still improvements to be made.
The borough continues to have occasional daily violations of air-quality standards in the winter. And there are continued state Department of Environmental Conservation advisories about health risks from particulate pollution, especially in the outlying community of North Pole, home to about 2,400 people, where inversions tend to be more intense. Over the winter of 2024-25, there were 32 such advisories issued for the borough.
Because federal standards on acceptable levels of fine particulates are tightened periodically, more progress is expected to be needed to meet future Clean Air Act requirements.
Extreme, but not unique
For Fairbanks, the air-quality challenge is stubborn, resulting from a mix of geography, climate and economics.
Like other cold-climate cities surrounded by mountainous regions, the Fairbanks area gets enveloped periodically in seasonal inversions, with stagnant cold air filled with ground-level emissions becoming trapped beneath warmer air.
“The cold air gets stuck in the valley and the warm air that’s the wind and it’s coming in from somewhere else just rides right over it,” said Bill Simpson, a UAF chemistry and biochemistry professor who studies Arctic air pollution.
 

  Air quality measurements taken Jan. 31, 2025, in the Fairbanks North Star Borough reveal more problems in North Pole than in the rest of the borough. Temperatures that day at the Fairbanks International Airport ranged from minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. (Graph provided by Fairbanks North Star Borough)

Inversions are common elsewhere, in places like Denver, Salt Lake City, Calgary and Anchorage. Those cities, like Fairbanks, have contended with trapped particulate pollution during inversions.
But Fairbanks’ inversions are more severe, more concentrated and longer lasting.
At this high latitude, there is little winter sunlight to overturn and weaken inversion layers, as happens in Rocky Mountain places like Salt Lake City and Denver. This far inland, there is no ocean breeze to disrupt the inversions, as happens in Anchorage or in Scandinavian cities.
The lack of winter sunlight and lack of ground-level heat and wind compresses the Fairbanks inversion layer to only 230 feet or so, Simpson said. Layers in Lower 48 sites are typically at least twice that high, Simpson said, making their particulate pollution more dispersed.
Once an inversion sets it, violations of the Clean Air Act’s 24-hour standard for fine particulates often follow, Simpson said.
“When there’s a really bad day, it’s just really hard to avoid because the boundary layer is so shallow,” he said.
Fairbanks inversions can persist for days, creating temperature differences between high and low elevations that are much as 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Levels of fine particulates within those inversion pockets, though much lower than they used to be, are typically close to twice the regulatory limit of 35 micrograms per cubic meter, according to the EPA.
Inversions are a fact of life for residents, like the West Valley High School ski team members who congregate for practices and competitions at Birch Hill, the cross-country venue on a ridge rising more than 1,000 feet above the city.
“If it’s cold, you don’t go on White Bear. It can be like a 20-degree difference sometimes” said team member Maya Griek, referring to a long trail that loops down to the ridge’s lowest elevations.
Burning wood for heat
While there are multiple contributors, from big coal-fired power plants to small local coffee roasters, the primary reason for Fairbanks’ winter air pollution is relatively simple. It comes down to what people burn to stay warm and how they burn it.

	That also makes it hard to control.
Fairbanks temperatures can dip below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, and residents rely heavily on woodburning stoves as either main sources of heat or supplemental sources and where natural gas options are limited. That is a contrast to cities like Anchorage and Calgary, where most indoor heat comes from natural gas, or Scandinavian cities, where heat pumps and geothermal energy are widely used.
On the coldest days, severe inversions and pollution problems are most likely — and the desire to burn wood is the highest. But those are the days when burning is banned.
Burn bans have been unpopular. In 2018, voters passed an ordinance stripping the borough of enforcement powers on air-quality matters. Enforcement of bans and other matters, as a result, is up to the state.
That means the borough’s job, as Hopkins and Hoke describe it, is to monitor, provide opportunities for cleaner air and encourage residents to do the right thing.
“You can’t convince somebody to do something they don’t want to do,” Hoke said. “The best way to get them to do that is get them to see the benefits and then to convince themselves.”

	Since wood burning remains the top source of particulate pollution, much of that encouragement has focused on better wood stoves.
Since 2010, the borough, state and EPA have collaborated on a stove-trading program that enables people to replace inefficient stoves with modern versions. From 2010 to 2024, 4,783 old wood-burning stoves were swapped out for upgraded heating devices, according to the borough’s records.
Officials are also pushing residents to burn better wood. Kiln-dried wood, which burns more efficiently and produces less particulate pollution, is an important element of the newly approved plan.
Such wood has been offered since 2020 by a company called Aurora Energy Solutions. It has two kilns to process mostly birch, though some spruce is in the mix as well.
Birch, a hardwood, is the main firewood source in Interior Alaska. Though ubiquitous in the region and readily available through timber sales held on state land, it contains large amounts of water that can make burning slow and smoky.
The moisture content in delivered birch logs can be as high as 50%, in the form of liquid water in summer and ice in winter, said Susan Shopper, the general manager.

	The kilns, which are heated to 230 degrees, convert most of that moisture into steam that is released into the air. The resulting product has a moisture content that is no higher than 20%. The company aims for even lower levels that are in the teens, Shopper said.
There is high demand in winter for the dried wood, which costs money up front but saves it in the long run, she said.
But when it comes to meeting that demand, there is a seasonal mismatch.
The best season for drying wood is summer, when the coal-fired electricity plant across the street has the most excess steam power to sell to the kiln operation. It generally takes 4 ½ days to complete a wood-drying cycle in the winter; in summer, that time is cut to two days, Shopper said.
The worst time to dry wood, or to buy dried wood, is the dead of winter, when people want it the most.
During the hot, around-the-clock summer daylight, it can be a challenge to get customers to think about stocking up on wood for the cold, dark winter to come, Shopper said.

	“Processing and drying in the summer is very advantageous for us economically. But that’s not what people tend to want to buy firewood, so it’s kind of hard,” she said.
Lessons from science
While the characteristics of Fairbanks’ air-quality situation make it tough to address, they also fascinate scientists.
In 2022, nearly 50 scientists from North America and Europe gathered at UAF for a project to examine details of the borough’s air quality. The Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis project, or ALPACA, was not focused on regulation, but the information has proved useful to agencies and to people trying to address air-quality problems in other far-north and mountainous regions that also face inversion challenges.

	For seven weeks, the group made detailed measurements of air quality and weather conditions at varying atmospheric layers. They also examined indoor air quality and the interplay between indoor combustion and outdoor particulates.
Their studies have explored not only what goes into the air but how different pollutants react with each other once emitted, said Simpson, the project’s leader.
While woodsmoke is the underlying problem, emissions from other sources like power plants and heavy diesel-burning vehicles compound it, as different pollutants’ molecules bond with the woodsmoke molecules.

	One important finding is that sulfur, a byproduct of diesel, oil and coal combustion, is a significant problem. Through that chemical bonding process, sulfur is responsible for about 20% of the particulate mass, Simpson said.
Information about sulfur’s proven contribution helped lead the EPA to propose a mandate for ultra-low-sulfur fuel for those businesses and residents that burn diesel.
But state and borough officials convinced federal regulators that such a requirement would be counterproductive because the high cost of ultra-low-sulfur fuel in such an isolated market would drive some Fairbanks residents to burn more wood, even if they did so on the sly during ban periods.
A compromise that went into effect in September 2022 is a state regulation requiring low-sulfur in the Fairbanks area, but not ultra-low-sulfur fuel. While regular fuel has sulfur levels of about 2,000 parts per million, lower-sulfur fuel has half that. Ultra-low-sulfur fuel, in contrast, has no more than 15 parts of sulfur per million.

	Simpson said that the compromise has been effective in reducing the sulfur dioxide.
“What we’ve seen is that the SO2 in the atmosphere is cut in half. It’s really, really worked to clean up the amount of sulfur in the atmosphere,” he said.
Wood heating expected to endure
Could Fairbanks ever be entirely free of winter woodsmoke? It seems unlikely in the near future
The particulate-free source of energy used for heat elsewhere in Alaska – natural gas — has limited application in Fairbanks. The borough-owned Interior Gas Utility provides liquefied natural gas that is delivered by truck to about 3,000 customers. The utility touts the air-quality attributes of natural gas with a simple slogan on its website: “Breathe Easy.”
However, Fairbanks lacks the grid connections and economies of scale that make natural gas the dominant energy source in Anchorage and other parts of Southcentral Alaska.
To Hopkins, a wholesale switch to natural gas may be desirable from an air-pollution standpoint, but it is not realistic.

	“The problem is even if you get a gas line coming through Fairbanks, you’re never going to get infrastructure to a place that’s the size of Connecticut when you only have 100,000 people in the area. It’s too dispersed,” he said.
The challenging atmospheric inversions will remain, he notes. So will the winter cold, which means the appeal of wood and woodburning will endure among many residents.
Continued access to better stoves and better wood is a practical way to benefit both air quality and residents’ pocketbooks, he said.
“People see that it works. People see the financial savings to themselves,” he said.’

Though President Donald Trump has yet to explicitly order the Shasta Dam to be enlarged — something Republican lawmakers have been considering for decades — recent actions by his administration signal that he is moving in that direction. 
As CalMatters’ Alastair Bland explains, the prospect of raising the dam underscores the ongoing dispute between farmers, environmentalists and other key stakeholders over California’s water supply and its effect on the state’s fragile ecosystems. 
Increasing the Shasta Dam, such as raising the dam height by 18 feet, would deliver more water from the Sacramento River to Central Valley farmers.
So far Trump has signed executive orders instructing federal agencies to waive environmental rules with the aim to deliver more water to California growers. Earlier this month a congressional committee’s budget reconciliation bill also earmarked $2 billion “for construction and associated activities” that raise the capacity of the federal Bureau of Reclamation’s water storage facilities.One proponent of the dam expansion is the Westlands Water District, which provides water to San Joaquin Valley farmers who grow nuts, fruits, grains and vegetables. Increasing the reservoir’s volume would be good for the ecosystem, according to the district, because it would help threatened Chinook salmon spawn by keeping the water colder.
Barry Nelson, a policy advisor with the conservation group Golden State Salmon Association, disagrees. 

Nelson: “The idea that a Shasta raise would benefit salmon — particularly under this set of federal agencies — is absurd.”

Some state officials have also opposed expanding the dam in the past. In 2013 the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said raising the dam would have “significant and unavoidable impacts” on the Sacramento River ecosystem.
Members of the Winnemem Wintu tribe, who hold the Sacramento River as sacred, argue that a dam expansion would claim their last remaining territory, and could violate the state’s Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.

CA pushes back on Trump on in-state tuition

From CalMatters higher education reporter Mikhail Zinshteyn:
California says its policy of granting in-state tuition to immigrant students without legal status in the U.S. “complies with federal law,” seeking to repudiate a recent Trump executive order that directed his administration to find ways to bar states from allowing the practice.The California Student Aid Commission, which oversees state financial aid, issued a memo last week that said its policies are legal and notes that 25 states provide in-state tuition to immigrant students without legal status; some of these are so-called red states, such as Texas and Utah. The memo also cites past state and federal court rulings upholding in-state tuition policies.
California began granting in-state residency for immigrant students without legal status after a 2001 state law. An estimated 60,000 college students in California benefit from the law, which applies only to public institutions. The state is home to nearly 3 million public college and university students overall.
Trump’s order questioned why immigrant students without legal status can attend a public college with in-state tuition but out-of-state students cannot. His order relied on an interpretation of a 1996 immigration law.
A federal appeals court in 2023 dismissed a similar challenge echoed by Trump, writing that the 1996 law “has nothing to say about a rule like” in-state tuition for students without legal status. 



Get ready for the May Revise

Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to unveil an update to his January state budget proposal later this week, dubbed the May Revise, laying out more detail on funding for colleges, prisons, environmental programs, health care and so much more. 
The governor’s preliminary $332 billion budget plan in January had a “modest” surplus of $363 million initially estimated for 2025-26. But Newsom cautioned even then that California’s financial outlook was muddied by Trump’s anticipated economic policies and the colossal damage from the Los Angeles-area fires. 
Now the state could be facing at least a $10 billion budget shortfall, reported Politico, in part due to a Medi-Cal budget gap and stock market declines in response to Trump’s tariff policies.
In an updated forecast of Californias tax revenue by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office, revenues for 2025-26 are expected to be $7.8 billion less than projected in January. A combination of California’s “stagnant economy,” the stock market’s instability and “recent federal policy actions,” led the office to conclude that “the path to future growth could be narrow.”

Jason Sisney, budget advisor for the California Assembly, on future deficits: “State officials will find it difficult to avoid cuts to projected growth in health and social services programs, as well as higher education, housing, and natural resources programs, to begin lowering future projected deficits.”

,California,2025-05-12 12:35:00+00:00,CalMatters,Why a contentious project to raise California’s Shasta Dam could move forward under Trump,Alastair Bland,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/water/2025/05/shasta-dam-california-water-farmers-trump/,Enlarging the dam would deliver more Sacramento River water to Central Valley farmers but a tribe could lose sacred sites and endangered salmon could lose habitat in wet years.,"In summary
Enlarging the dam would deliver more Sacramento River water to Central Valley farmers but a tribe could lose sacred sites and endangered salmon could lose habitat in wet years.





Near the southern flank of Mount Shasta, springs and snowmelt converge to form the McCloud River. This Sacramento River tributary, held sacred by the Winnemem Wintu tribe, teemed with Chinook salmon before Shasta Dam, built in the 1940s, blocked their annual migrations. 
“The winter run was the main sustenance source for the Winnemem Wintu throughout history,” said tribal member Gary Mulcahy. “We consider them the grandfather of all salmon.”     
For several years, Winnemem Wintu leaders have collaborated with state and federal officials to reintroduce the critically endangered fish to this wilderness waterway in a historic effort to revitalize the McCloud and reconnect with their past.
But a federal proposal to increase the height of Shasta Dam by more than 18 feet to provide more water to farmers now threatens the tribe’s land and could harm salmon runs.
Contemplated for decades and gaining traction among Republican lawmakers, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s proposed Shasta Dam and Reservoir Enlargement Project would boost the capacity of California’s largest reservoir.
Since President Donald Trump took office for his second term, the federal government has not mounted any public effort to raise the dam. But Trump has taken several steps in that direction, including signing executive orders instructing federal officials to waive environmental rules and deliver more water to California growers.
Last week, the dam project appeared to get a push in the House Natural Resources Committee’s budget reconciliation bill, with a designation of $2 billion “for construction and associated activities that increase the capacity of existing Bureau of Reclamation surface water storage facilities.” Though the budget language does not name Shasta Dam, experts say it’s precisely crafted to facilitate the project. 
“There’s no mystery here,” said Barry Nelson, policy advisor with the Golden State Salmon Association. “That language is designed to push the Shasta raise.” 
Raising the dam was the “number-one priority” water project for the first Trump administration, Nelson said. 
However, U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Republican whose district includes Shasta and who helped draft the budget language, told CalMatters that while he endorses enlarging Shasta Dam, the reconciliation bill’s “funding is not for any specific project.” 
Last year, a bill that would have allocated funds for enlarging the dam while prohibiting state laws from obstructing the project died in the House. It was sponsored by 12 California Republicans, including LaMalfa.
The Bureau of Reclamation estimated in 2014 that enlarging Shasta Dam would cost $1.4 billion — roughly $1.8 billion in today’s dollars. Obtaining the array of state and federal permits for the dam could take years, and is likely to face court challenges.
The project would provide an additional 51,300 acre-feet of water per year to recipients — mainly farmers — of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project, according to a federal estimate. That would increase the amount they receive on average by less than 1% , which Ron Stork, a policy expert with the group Friends of the River, referred to as “decimal dust.”

The dam project would claim some of the Winnemem Wintu’s last remaining territory and could violate the state’s Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which explicitly prohibits constructing reservoirs on the McCloud’s final miles before entering Lake Shasta. 
State officials have publicly opposed the project in the past. In 2013, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said raising the dam would have “significant and unavoidable impacts” on the Sacramento River ecosystem. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has similarly warned federal officials that the project would restrict high-water flows and reduce fish habitat.
State officials declined to comment for this story.  Bureau of Reclamation spokesperson Peter Soeth also declined to comment. 
Stork, a longtime opponent of the dam raise, said the Trump administration is liable to ignore the state law. Trump’s January executive order directed federal officials to deliver more water through the Central Valley Project “by increasing storage and conveyance … notwithstanding any contrary State or local laws.”
“We certainly expect some serious mischief here,” Stork said. “The president’s executive order more or less says, ‘Please find ways to accomplish my agenda by trying to get around state and federal law.’” 
Mulcahy, the Winnemem Wintu’s government liaison, said Lake Shasta flooded 90% of his tribe’s historical territory. “Village sites, sacred sites, cultural gathering sites,” he said. 
Increasing the dam’s height will do even more damage, he said, periodically inundating many important gathering places, including the Kabyai Creek burial ground, where dozens of tribal members were laid to rest after a vicious 1854 massacre by white settlers.
It would also flood a cleansing pool for Winnemem men, a riverside dancing mesa and a young women’s coming-of-age ceremony site called Puberty Rock. This, Mulcahy said, will fray some of the last remaining cultural threads holding together the tribe, which he said consists of about 140 members. 
“We wouldn’t be able to hold the ceremonies that are necessary to fulfill our spiritual and cultural needs,” he said. 
The Winnemem Wintu are not included on the official list of federally recognized tribes, which could limit their influence over the project.  
Polarizing farmers and environmentalists
Like many Delta and Central Valley water supply projects, the Shasta Dam raise has polarized farmers and environmentalists in a dispute over how it would affect Chinook salmon.
Environmentalists and fishery advocates say it will imperil already declining salmon populations, while project proponents, including the Westlands Water District, say it will help the ecosystem.
Westlands provides water, imported mostly from the Delta, to San Joaquin Valley farmers who grow 150,000 acres of pistachios and almonds — their main crops — as well as other fruits, grains and vegetables.

But General Manager Allison Febbo said the Shasta project isn’t directly about water supply. Rather, she said, it’s meant to help fish. Febbo explained that increasing the reservoir’s volume will keep its water colder, which is essential for spawning.
If the plight of the fish improves, Febbo said, regulations on water diversions might be eased — which would amount to an indirect benefit to water users like Westlands.
“We keep getting ratcheted down as the species continues to decline, so our water supply isn’t going to get any better until the species gets better,” Febbo said. 
LaMalfa also stressed that the project would be “a win-win” by increasing water storage and better insulating the reservoir’s cold-water pool.
“More water for people and more cold water for salmon,” the congressman said. 
Raising the dam would mean “more water for people and more cold water for salmon.”U.S REP.  DOUG LAMALFA
But Nelson, at the Golden State Salmon Association, said Shasta Dam has already “been absolutely catastrophic for salmon.”
“The idea that a Shasta raise would benefit salmon — particularly under this set of federal agencies — is absurd,” he said.
Completed in 1945, the dam blocked Chinook from reaching hundreds of miles of stream habitat. For the winter-run Chinook — whose unique life cycle involves residing and spawning in freshwater through summer — the ice-cold McCloud was their stronghold. 
“It can be 110 degrees in the canyon there, and you can be standing in the river in waders and your legs are so cold it hurts,” said Rene Henery, California science director with the group Trout Unlimited, as he explained the importance of the McCloud to the future survival of winter-run Chinook. 
“The idea that a Shasta raise would benefit salmon — particularly under this set of federal agencies — is absurd.”BARRY NELSON, GOLDEN STATE SALMON ASSN.
Today, the fish — which enter freshwater in the winter — cling to existence in a short stretch of river downstream of Lake Shasta, surviving thanks to the release of cold water stored deep in the reservoir. However, this resource frequently runs out in the summer as the fish lay and fertilize their eggs, which can lead to complete spawning failures in lethally warm water.
While a more voluminous reservoir could theoretically keep its water colder for longer, Henery said the changing climate is likely to complicate this equation. Filling the enlarged reservoir in a hotter, drier future is the main problem. 
“Dams don’t make water, so in a low-water year, raising the dam does nothing,” he said. 
In wet years, he added, the enlarged dam will harm fish by capturing water that would otherwise flood vital wetland habitat downstream, like the recently restored Yolo Bypass, west of Sacramento. “The inundation we get on the Yolo Bypass is what’s keeping salmon populations hanging on in the Sacramento,” Henery said. 
Jon Rosenfield, science director at the advocacy group San Francisco Baykeeper, added that “expanding the dam will capture more of the high flows (during wet years) that are now the only lifeline those fish have.”
Mulcahy said he is hopeful that the project — though currently revving with Republican horsepower — will soon run out of steam. Labor and material costs are rising, he said, and the longer the project goes unbuilt, the more expensive it gets. 
“They’re going to try and negate state law so that they can proceed however they want,” Mulcahy said. “But if we can last this one out, I think it may bury itself once and for all.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/050924_Shasta-Dam_DWR_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-12 09:05:03.915300

Catherine S. Ramírez
Catherine S. Ramírez is a professor of Latin American and Latino studies at UC Santa Cruz, and the author of “Assimilation: An Alternative History.”


At 98, my father’s paper trail was long — in addition to his U.S. birth certificate, there were his discharge papers from his service in the Army Air Corps during World War II, his house deed, his children’s birth certificates, his Social Security, Medicare and business cards. 
Yet in 2023, when he applied for a Real ID identification card, a security-enhanced, federally accepted form of identification that airports require as of this month, his application was declined because the names on his passport (Vicente) and driver’s license (Vince) didn’t match. Instead, he was issued a California Senior Citizen Identification Card — which wouldn’t let him board a flight, enter a secured federal building or register to vote.  
My father’s succession of names testifies to the ways American culture coerces and seduces both natives and newcomers to comply with its norms, promising social and political inclusion and upward social mobility. But paradoxically, that same evolution, which pushed him from Vicente to Vince, from “Mexican” to American, rendered him effectively “undocumented” with his declined Real ID application.
Born in Nogales, Arizona, to Mexican immigrants in 1924, my father’s first language, like his original first name, was Spanish, a vestige of the viceroyalty of New Spain and the Republic of Mexico in southern Arizona. I suspect his American teachers changed his name to Vincent when he was a boy. By the time he was a teenager in East L.A. in the early 1940s, Vincent had morphed into Vince. 
“To Vince, a real swell dancer,” his girlfriend, Bea Shapiro, inscribed in his Garfield High School yearbook.  
That my father managed to achieve all that he did in life with little more than his Garfield High diploma evinced not only his fierce work ethic, but also the viability of the American dream in the 20th century. My father began life on the physical and symbolic margin of the nation in a small house that lacked indoor plumbing and ended his career as a senior transportation engineer at CalTrans. 
But his declined Real ID application effectively erased that biography, exposing a failure of assimilation, and laying bare Americans’ vulnerability to disenfranchisement, regardless of their distance from the immigration experience or their status as U.S. citizens. 
The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE Act, has brought that vulnerability into relief. Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the legislation requiring Americans to provide documentary proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate, to register to vote. The bill’s supporters, nearly all Republicans, maintain that it will help “restore public confidence in elections.” Even though citizenship is already a requirement to vote in federal elections and cases of noncitizens voting are statistically rare, President Trump has made the baseless claim that Democrats have recruited noncitizens to vote against him. 
The “illegal alien” voter is a phantasm, but voter suppression is real — and the SAVE Act threatens to further disenfranchise voters. More than 140 million U.S. citizens don’t have a passport, and more than 21 million don’t have a passport or birth certificate that’s “readily available.” Not unlike my dad, some 69 million women who’ve taken their spouse’s name don’t have a birth certificate matching their legal name. Only 18% of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey had successfully changed the name on their birth certificate so that it aligned with their other documents. And because the SAVE Act mandates that prospective voters present documentary proof of U.S. citizenship at their local election office, isolated rural voters and anyone who doesn’t or can’t drive — young adults, older people, voters with certain disabilities — risk disenfranchisement. 
My father died before Real ID went into effect, so he never had to suffer the injustice of being turned away at a polling station or an airport, or, worse, of being deported because he lacked the right document. Still, his inability to get a Real ID is a warning of the limits, federal and otherwise, that millions of real Americans may now face.

Carnahan.","Born Jan. 22, 1929Manhattan, KansasDied May 7, 2025Randolph Center, VermontDetails of servicesA memorial service is being planned for August at St. Michael’s Episcopal Church, Brattleboro.John Hillis Carnahan, 96, longtime Brattleboro attorney, passed away peacefully May 7, 2025, at Menig Nursing Home, Randolph Center, Vermont. Prior to moving to Randolph, John and his wife Mary lived on Tyler Street in Brattleboro for 56 years.John was born in Manhattan, Kansas, on January 22, 1929, the middle son of Paul Adelbert and Gladys Kelly Paul Carnahan. He attended Harvard University (Class of 1950) and Harvard Law School (Class of 1954) while serving in the Navy.Carnahan married Mary Elizabeth Faigle in August 1955. They moved to Brattleboro where John began working for the law firm Fitts & Olson. Less than two years later he became the Administrative Assistant to U.S. Congressman William H. Meyer, the first Democrat ever elected to the U.S. Congress from Vermont. Carnahan moved to Rutland, Vermont, and served as the Assistant U.S. Attorney for Vermont from 1961-1965. In 1965 he returned to Brattleboro as an associate with the law firm of Kristensen, Cummings and Price. Two years later he was appointed Windham County District Judge by Gov. Philip H. Hoff. In 1973 he rejoined Fitts & Olson as a partner; the firm was renamed Fitts, Olson, Carnahan, Anderson & Bump and later was known as Fitts, Olson, Carnahan & Giddings. He worked there until 1995, when he became a sole practitioner, retiring in 2004.Carnahan was especially active in the Democratic party. He was Democratic National Committeeman for Vermont, 1979-1988; Democratic State Chairperson, 1977; and the party’s unsuccessful candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1984. He was involved in many campaigns over the years and hosted countless Democratic candidates who visited Brattleboro, introducing them to everyone he knew.A longtime and active member of St. Michael’s Episcopal Church, Carnahan was known for his quiet kindness. He generously gave his time to many organizations. He served on more than a dozen social service agency boards during his lifetime, including trustee of the Brattleboro Retreat from 1970-1994.Carnahan was also active in historical and cultural organizations. He was a trustee of the Brattleboro Museum and Art Center in the 1980s. He began serving as a trustee of the Vermont Historical Society in 1982 and served as its president (1993-1995). He was a founding member of both the Brattleboro Historical Society (1982) and the Estey Organ Museum (2002). He served on the Advisory Council for the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation and was a trustee of the Preservation Trust of Vermont. He helped establish the Friends of the Vermont State House. Carnahan was interested in the architecture and history of U.S. state capitol buildings and donated his extensive collection of state capitol postcards to the Curator of State Buildings in 2021.John was an avid newspaper reader. In their later years John and Mary could be seen walking daily to get multiple newspapers at Baker’s or Putney Road Market. They also enjoyed partaking of the musical offerings of various organizations that are in the Brattleboro area including the Brattleboro Music Center and the Friends of Music at Guilford.John had a lifelong desire to improve Brattleboro’s physical appearance. His children remember him walking home from work carrying trash he had picked up along the way! He was instrumental in the restoration and redesign of the Brattleboro Common bandstand in 1976 to open the front so that performers and speakers could be closer to their audiences. In the 1980s, he led the charge to move Brattleboro’s historic Wells Fountain 25 feet away from traffic and into a welcoming park where a gas station once stood in the heart of Brattleboro.John took great joy in his family, especially at multi-generational celebrations at the house on Tyler Street. He was predeceased by his brothers and his beloved daughter Sarah Kelly Carnahan in 2014. He is survived by Mary, his wife of 70 years, his son Paul (Eve) of Montpelier, his daughter Susan (William) Vodrey of Cleveland, Ohio, his son-in-law Alfredo Quintero of New York City, eight grandchildren, as well as nieces and nephews.

None of the sweeping changes in H.454, the associated risks, nor the hassles to school districts are necessary.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Former Vermont lawmakers: An open letter to the Vermont General Assembly.","This commentary is by a group of former Vermont lawmakers. Their names are listed below the text of the commentary.More than 50 years ago, Vermont recognized the hardship faced by homeowners whose property taxes were rising faster than their ability to pay them. Since then, state fiscal policy has moved, in fits and starts, toward a system where school taxes are based on Vermonters’ income, the best measure of their ability to pay. We, former Vermont legislators, urge you not to abandon a half-century of progress. Instead, we hope you will fulfill the promise of Act 60, which we helped pass in 1997, and ask Vermont homeowners with the most income to contribute their fair share to the cost of education by paying based on income. Vermont’s education funding system is committed both to fair taxation and local decision making, and we can strengthen both of those. Instead, H.454, the education reform bill that recently passed the Vermont House of Representatives, weakens them. Income-based school taxes ease pressure on homeowners with modest earnings that don’t keep pace with rising real estate prices and property taxes. For high-earning homeowners, income is a more accurate reflection of their means than a single piece of property, so taxes based on income are critical to fair school funding for all.H.454 as passed by the Vermont House takes the state in the opposite direction. The bill would repeal the law’s current provision allowing residents to pay some or all of their school taxes based on their income, which 70% of Vermont homeowners do. Instead, H.454 recommits the state to regressive property taxes that hit low- and middle income residents the hardest.To temper the negative impacts of the property tax for those with incomes of $115,000 or less, the plan puts in place homestead exemptions, which provide relief for some but still rely on property taxes. Lawmakers have considered homestead exemptions over the last 50 years and repeatedly rejected them as too complicated and failing to achieve the fairness of income-based taxes.H.454 does nothing to address the unfair tax break in the current funding system. Many of Vermont’s wealthiest homeowners pay school taxes on their property that are less than their income-based taxes would be. H.454 allows these homeowners to continue to pay property taxes instead of asking them to pay the same share of their income to support education as average Vermonters pay.H.454 also brings back a foundation formula — state-determined and state-funded grants that can be supplemented by local school districts — which Vermont tried before the state supreme court declared it unconstitutional in 1997. The constitutional problems can be overcome, and H.454 attempts to do so. But this, too, is something the Legislature tried decades ago and found unworkable because it was overly complicated and made tax rates unpredictable from year to year.None of the sweeping changes in H.454, the associated risks, nor the hassles to school districts are necessary. The sharp increase in taxes last year was due in large part to costs outside of school districts’ control and also to legislative missteps in the previous two years.And while the governor likes to say the message from the election was that schools are spending too much, that’s not the case. School spending in Vermont as a percentage of the state’s economy has been a stable 5.5% to 6% for decades.Unfair taxes anger taxpayers and alienate them from participation in decision-making about their schools — and that hurts students, teachers and communities. H.454 does not solve these problems. Rather, in reaching for elusive “efficiencies,” with promises of better education, the bill doubles down on school consolidation, which many Vermonters have rejected; that will alienate more citizens by taking budgetary decision-making out of communities’ hands.There are immediate, affordable changes to the existing law that would make the system fairer for the Vermonters hurt last year. Instead of rushing to new and unproven — or old, proven-unworkable — financing mechanisms and an unprecedented move away from local control, the Legislature should adopt those changes.We are proud that for 30 years Vermont has had the most equitable school financing system in the country, supporting schools that produce some of the highest test scores in the country. Not incidentally, our schools hold together many of the small rural communities that make Vermont an enviable place to live. H.454 risks destroying much of this. Vermont deserves better. Former Rep.

(Photo by Kimberly Fraser/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Flickr)For years, outdoors enthusiasts in New Mexico have pushed to overhaul the state Department of Game & Fish — an agency plagued by leadership turnover, funding woes and the scorn of hunters and tree-huggers alike.
Now, state lawmakers have given the agency a new name, a new mission, new leadership and a boost in funding to expand its role. The sweeping law enacted in March puts New Mexico at the forefront of a growing movement to rethink states’ traditional model of wildlife management.
“We came from a place of extreme dysfunction,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, an environmental nonprofit that advocated for the new law. “Now, I truly do believe that we’re going to be a gold standard for wildlife management. Over the next few years. you’re going to see an unbelievable shift.”
New Mexico’s new approach expands the agency’s focus beyond hunting and fishing to protect more species and brings in new funding to reduce its reliance on license sales. Other states are watching closely. Lawmakers across the country have introduced bills to change their wildlife agencies, and many have cited the New Mexico measure as an example of what’s possible.
“That’s the biggest game changer,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a national nonprofit focused on overhauling states’ wildlife governance. “That’s the legislation we’ll be pointing to as a model in future years.”
From Oregon to Utah to Florida, legislators have introduced bills that would overhaul their wildlife agencies’ funding, mission and governance.
While the proposals have had varying levels of success, New Mexico leaders say it took years of coalition-building to get their bill across the finish line. Wildlife advocates expect the issue to earn more legislative attention nationwide in the years to come.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.

Under the traditional model, state wildlife agencies have largely been funded by the license fees paid by hunters and anglers, plus federal excise taxes on equipment such as guns and fishing tackle. The agencies have focused most of their work on species like deer and trout, prized by the sporting groups that provide their revenue.
In New Mexico, as in most states, the commissions that govern these departments have been appointed by governors. They’re often filled by hunting and fishing guides, ranchers and political donors. Critics say this model results in panels that set policy to protect their economic interests.
Today, many wildlife agencies are struggling to stay afloat as fewer and fewer residents hunt and fish. At the same time, plummeting wildlife populations are compelling agencies to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species. And some wildlife advocates are demanding a new governance model that puts more scientists in charge.
This year, state lawmakers across the country have passed or considered a host of major wildlife management overhauls. Some would expand their agencies’ mission to focus on non-game species. Others would provide new funding streams to take on that additional work. And some would change the makeup of the commissions that dictate wildlife policy.
In New Mexico, lawmakers did all three at once.
The state’s agency had faced numerous problems over the years. Hunters and bird-watchers alike were frustrated with the agency’s leadership. In recent years, several commissioners have resigned or been forced out by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. At times, the panel has lacked enough members to form a quorum.
The agency’s budget was in trouble as well. The state had not raised license fees in nearly 20 years, keeping revenue flat even as inflation made the cost of its work more and more expensive.
“We were having to repurpose money from on-the-ground conservation just to make salary adjustments,” said Stewart Liley, wildlife division chief with the New Mexico Department of Game & Fish. “We were getting to a precarious spot.”
In 2023, lawmakers passed a bill to restructure the agency’s commission, which would have taken some power away from the governor. Lujan Grisham declined to sign the bill, killing the effort with a pocket veto.
 










We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it's the only one we've got.


– Jesse Deubel, New Mexico Wildlife Federation executive director




This year, lawmakers took a bigger swing. The package passed this session renames the Department of Game & Fish to the Department of Wildlife. It expands the agency’s authority to protect non-game species in need of conservation help.
“We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it’s the only one we’ve got,” said Deubel, of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “They’ve got a responsibility to work on any species in the state that has conservation need.”
Agency leaders say they were already conducting research and conservation work for non-game species. They viewed that aspect of the bill as a largely symbolic measure that “shined a light” on the need for more restoration work, Liley said. However, the law did provide more explicit authority for the agency to manage insects and regulate the direct “take,” or killing, of certain animals.
The measure raises license fees — a provision supported by many hunting and fishing groups — and allows for inflation-based adjustments in future years. Meanwhile, lawmakers included another $10.5 million from the state budget, spread over three years, to help the agency take on more non-game conservation.
“It seemed only fair that if we were going to ask the department to take on a broader role that they not finance that just through hunting and fishing,” said Democratic state Rep. Matthew McQueen, who was among the key sponsors.
Liley, the agency official, said the new money, along with a separate conservation fund established in 2023, will more than double the state’s investment in helping threatened species. The agency expects to hire up to eight new biologists who will conduct research, determine which species need aid and lead restoration efforts.
“This will help us get a better grasp of where we are with different species across the state,” he said. “There are absolutely projects we have not undertaken because of lack of capacity. This will allow us to do more surveys, to radio-mark birds, to [use that research] and say, ‘Let’s do forest restoration this way for pinyon jays.’”
The package will also change the agency’s governance. The current commission has seven seats, all appointed by the governor. Lujan Grisham’s appointees have included a car dealer, an Exxon Mobil lobbyist and a former lawmaker who owns an oil and gas business.
Under the new model, a bipartisan legislative committee will nominate three candidates for every seat, each of whom must be vetted to demonstrate their knowledge of wildlife. The governor must choose from among those three. One of the seats will be reserved for a wildlife scientist, one for a conservationist, one for a hunter and angler and one for a rancher or farmer.
“These changes add expertise and really important perspectives to the commission,” said Chris Smith, wildlife program director with WildEarth Guardians, an environmental nonprofit. “Our [current] commission was having structural problems and light scandal almost consistently.”
Backers’ one disappointment is that Lujan Grisham used a partial veto to strike a provision that would have protected commission members from dismissal by the governor. She argued that the proposed change relied too heavily on the slow-moving court system to remove commissioners, making it difficult to hold problematic members accountable.
Political appointees set state wildlife policy. Critics say that’s a problem.

Lawmakers say they’re still intent on protecting agency leaders from the governor’s whims, but pleased the rest of the package has gone into effect. While the measure passed with bipartisan majorities, some lawmakers objected to the idea of expanding the agency’s mission to protect species beyond those that can be hunted.
“With all due respect, I don’t want to pay for a butterfly,” said Republican state Rep. Harlan Vincent, according to KUNM. “I’m just being honest with you.”
And some groups are skeptical that the extra funding from the state budget will be enough to cover the agency’s growing conservation role.
“If New Mexico wants to expand the mission of the department, New Mexico needs to pay for it,” Tom Paterson, president-elect of the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association, said during a Senate committee hearing. “The necessary funds should not come on the back of the license fees that hunters and anglers pay.”
While the agency’s new funding and mission are now in place, its name change to the Department of Wildlife won’t take effect until next year. And its current commission will remain in office until Jan. 1, 2027. Lujan Grisham’s successor will then appoint new commissioners under the revised model.
The advocates who backed the New Mexico overhaul say it will take time and investment to make the new model work. They know other states will be watching closely.

Lawmakers backed the bulk of Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte’s multimillion-dollar vision to bolster and expand the system, which has experienced waitlists for care and has been working in recent years to reverse the loss of community-based mental health services and regain federal certification of the state psychiatric hospital, lost in 2022 after a spate of patient deaths. Legislators then went several steps further to fill what they saw as gaps in the governor’s proposals.
They agreed to build a new mental health facility in eastern Montana, add more beds at existing state facilities, fund more crisis beds in communities, revise some civil and criminal commitment procedures, and reimburse counties when criminal defendants ordered to state facilities are held in county jails.
“For our families that struggle in these systems, it gives us so much hope,” said Matt Kuntz, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness’ Montana chapter, about the legislative action.
The state’s behavioral health system faced an array of problems going into the 2025 legislative session. They included shortages in community services, particularly in rural areas, created by deep cuts made in 2017 in response to a state budget shortfall, along with a backlog of criminal defendants waiting for evaluations and services at the state-run psychiatric hospital.
The prospects of the situation improving seemed dim for a long time, Kuntz said. “Then you have the governor’s office, the legislature, the counties, the county attorneys all working together to bring tangible solutions. And they got the votes.”
That support built over time as the state spent money on improvements needed to regain the Montana State Hospital’s federal certification and counties came under increasing pressure due to a lack of services and treatment beds. The legislature and governor committed to review the system in 2023.
In all, lawmakers approved about $124 million in state spending and as much as $40 million in federal funds during the next two years for behavioral health services, a new state-owned facility, and additional beds in existing facilities.
“The people that need our support, the people that can’t take care of themselves, the families that are struggling with their family member that can’t take care of themselves at some points in time are going to benefit from what we did,” Republican state Sen. John Esp said in summing up the legislature’s work.
The spending approved by the legislature goes well beyond the money Gianforte requested for behavioral health changes. He included 10 funding requests in his proposed state budget for the next two years that totaled about $43.5 million in state funds and $42 million in federal funds. The requests were based on recommendations from the Behavioral Health System for Future Generations Commission.
Lawmakers created that commission in 2023 to review state-funded services for people with mental illness, substance use disorders, and developmental disabilities. Legislators that year set aside $300 million to be spent in future years on recommendations made by the commission.
Even before the start of the session, some legislators questioned whether the governor’s budget did enough to address the lack of both community-based crisis services and forensic beds at the Montana State Hospital, which are for people in the criminal justice system.
Two bills introduced in January — House Bill 236 and HB 237 — sought to address lengthy jail holds experienced by some people waiting for mental health evaluations or treatment before their trials can proceed. Defendants generally obtain those services at the Montana State Hospital’s forensic unit.
Both bills failed. But testimony on the measures, as well as on the governor’s budget requests, drew attention to the backlog of people waiting in jails across the state. Legislators heard of prolonged delays — some stretching more than a year — that sometimes led to cases being dismissed because of concerns that the delays had violated the defendants’ constitutional right to a speedy trial.
By April, the legislature was considering possible fixes on several fronts.
During an April 15 hearing on Senate Bill 429 to revise criminal commitment procedures, Chad Parker, a state health department attorney, described the measure as “a very robustly negotiated bill.” Nanette Gilbertson, representing the Montana County Attorneys’ Association and the Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, said it contained elements “that I know were tough pills to swallow for both the associations I work for and the department.”
The bill would allow involuntary medication of defendants in county jails under certain circumstances — an idea state officials initially opposed — and prohibit the filing of a contempt charge if someone isn’t admitted to the Montana State Hospital for treatment because a bed isn’t available, which was important to the state to include.
Gilbertson told the House Judiciary Committee the bill was just one of several that, “taken in a package, are going to create immense change in the mental health and behavioral health system in the state of Montana.”
They include bills to reimburse counties for the costs of holding people waiting for state mental health services, allow short-term mental health holds in the community, improve delivery and payment for community services, and create more beds in state facilities for people committed through both criminal and civil procedures.
Legislators also approved money for a new mental health facility, expected to be built in eastern Montana, that will include more forensic beds.
Gianforte spokesperson Kaitlin Price said Gianforte would carefully consider the bills passed in addition to his proposals.
The governor’s original budget request focused primarily on community services. Legislators approved all but one, which would have created an electronic bed registry. The approved requests will revise reimbursement rates for developmental disability services, residential youth psychiatric treatment, and crisis and outpatient behavioral health services. They also will reopen clinics for early diagnosis of developmental disabilities in children, provide workforce incentives, and seek to improve delivery of services to people with developmental disabilities who have complex needs.
Esp, who served on the behavioral health commission and sponsored several of the bills, cautioned that the success of this year’s efforts will depend on whether future legislatures and governors spend the money needed to continue the new services.
“The problem we’ve always had around here is we look at things in two-year increments and towards the next election instead of looking at what’s the best policy for the state of Montana, long term,” he said.

The lieutenant governor posted a photo of the State Government Committee clerk’s notebook, where the vote was tallied, in the comment section of his Facebook post. The nos included Republican members, and Rep. Chris Sells, R-Greenville, chair of the committee, asked Ainsworth to take the photo down.
“I just stood up for my members … I’m gonna try to protect my people. I mean, they voted, how they voted. It was on video, and it’s in the record. I mean, it’s not like you can’t find it,” Sells said in a phone interview Friday. “But that was like adding fuel on the fire to me.”

Republicans on the committee said in interviews last week they had several concerns over the legislation and the way it got in front of them after an identical bill was rejected by another House committee. 
“I had heard from three of my four superintendents that they were not in favor of the bill, as is,” said Rep. Russell Bedsole, R-Alabaster, one of three Republicans to vote against the bill in committee Wednesday.
Messages seeking comment were left Friday with Ainsworth and House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, who put the bill in committee. 

Rejected twice

The Legislature passed a law in 2019 that allows school boards to adopt a policy on released time religious instruction (RTRI). SB 278, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, would have mandated that districts adopt those policies.
The bill passed the Senate Education Policy Committee on April 16 with one “no” vote, and passed the Senate 25-6 on April 22. 
But shortly after the Senate bill was filed, House members rejected HB 342, sponsored by Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, an identical bill, on a 9-4 vote. Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, chair of the House Education Policy Committee, said in an interview she would not take the Senate version in her committee.
“I don’t know why we’d take up a bill that didn’t have the support,” Collins said on April 30. 
Collins cited opposition from education groups as part of the reason for the defeat. Education groups have cited a host of concerns, ranging from a lack of definitions of religion in the bill to liability questions to a lack of knowledge about both certifications and curricula in RTRI programs. 
The Alabama Association of School Boards has been a consistent opponent. Executive Director Sally Smith said in March she thought the program would create an uneven playing field for students.

“We just don’t think that would be a level playing field,” Smith said in March. “We don’t have any authority under the legislation to determine the rigor or whether it merits the same level of credit.”
Bedsole said superintendents in his district saw no need for the bill. 
“They were operating perfectly fine under the 2019 legislation that permitted them to enact policies to do the same thing,” he said. “The only lobbyists I spoke with were those who were proponents for the bill.”
Bedsole said he is supportive of religion in schools, but LifeWise Academy, a nonprofit that offers  RTRI and has lobbied for the legislation, could not answer his questions. 
“One of my specific questions is when we talk about religion, what religion was, the definition of religion and who would be considered a religion for the purposes of this bill,” Bedsole said. “Nobody had an answer that I felt like gave me any comfort in knowing that if a local school board created a policy and somehow it excluded a certain religious group that they wouldn’t be subject to a lawsuit.”
According to LifeWise’s sample curriculum, the organization teaches the Christian belief that “God created all things good” to a list of virtues that the nonprofit describes as “LifeWise qualities.” Sunnie Cotton, the Alabama director, said Wednesday the organization is operating in about 600 schools nationwide and is prepared to launch over 900 programs this year.
Rep. Marcus Paramore, R-Troy, who serves on both of the committees that rejected the bill, said Wednesday the superintendents in his district are not supportive of the legislation.
“I know this was in Ed Policy, which you and I both serve on, and we know what the outcome of that committee meeting was,” Paramore said to DuBose, who handled the legislation Wednesday. “So here we are in another committee, trying to get a bill that was voted down back out, and on the floor in a different format.”
Messages seeking comment were left Friday with Parramore and Rep. Mike Kirkland, R-Scottboro, the other Republican to vote against it. 

A suddenly called meeting

Ainsworth went on a radio show Friday morning and claimed members let lobbyists dictate their vote. 
“Liberal school superintendents used taxpayer-funded lobbyists to kill a bill allowing Bible study and character education as an elective course in public schools,” Ainsworth wrote in a Facebook post Friday morning. “It’s time to take a closer look at the political efforts of activist superintendents and how they are being funded.”
Since the beginning of March, DuBose has claimed that 4,500 Alabama parents signed a petition in support of the legislation. Ryan Hollingsworth, the executive director of the State Superintendents Association and consistent opposer, openly doubted those numbers during the public hearing on the bill Wednesday.
DuBose said in a phone interview Thursday that she did not appreciate the comment, but was unable to provide the list of names on the petition. She said the petition was administered by LifeWise Academy and was only sent out to people that already knew about the program. DuBose said Shelby County had 320 interested parents, Alabaster City had 56 and Pelham City had 13. 
“I stand behind those numbers,” she said. “They do exist … I don’t like when my integrity is questioned by saying it is unknown whether that list is accurate or not, or whether it really exists.”
The bill was re-referred to Sells’ committee on Tuesday by the House Speaker’s office. Bedsole said the meeting was called with 18 hours’ notice and he did not see the bills on the agenda until later in the evening, which Sells confirmed.
Typically, all committee meetings must be scheduled at least 24 hours in advance, but according to legislative rules, after the 20th Legislative Day meetings can be called with only six hours’ notice to members. Wednesday was the 29th Legislative Day. Sells said he called the meeting when the legislation was re-referred to his committee.
Bedsole said he was not aware that the House version of the bill failed in committee. The lack of notice, he said, contributed to his vote against it. 
“So my vote that you’ve seen is reflective of a bill that was brought to me with less than 24 hours notice, with a lot of unanswered questions,” Bedsole said. “I thought it deserved a lot more time and attention than trying to pass it out of committee in the last remaining days of our session.”
Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, made the motion to approve the legislation. He was in the education committee meeting when DuBose’s bill failed and he said he was surprised by the opposition. 
“I just thought it was a very friendly bill for Republicans, because as a whole, we’re wholeheartedly in support of liberty and religious liberty,” Butler said in a phone interview Friday. “Several people were out that day, so on another day, it might have passed, but it went through the process.”
Ten of 14 House State Government Committee members were present on Wednesday. 
Next year?

Sells and Butler said they think the legislation will pass next year. Sells voted in favor of the bill, but said he is against the process in which the bill came to his committee. 
“We didn’t have long, you know, it was kind of dumped in our laps,” he said. “We’re not going to vote against Jesus, I promise you that… It’s the process. It’s not what it was doing. It’s the process of doing it.”
Sells also backed up the members of his committee that voted against the bill. 
“They don’t work for the lieutenant governor,” he said. “They work for the people in their districts.”
Bedsole said he felt the bill was rushed and he said he is worried about the unintended consequences of it.
“Sometimes in government, we are blamed for not considering unintended consequences. And this was one of those situations where I felt like it was a bit rushed on the House Committee, and I fear there would be some unintended consequences that we weren’t prepared for,” Bedsole said.
Bedsole said he would work with the sponsors to pass the bill next year once his questions are answered.
“I think it was in our best interest to get back to the table next year,” he said. “I’d be happy to be part of the conversation and address and hopefully get some answers to the questions I have.”

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Lawmakers appear open to advancing a proposal that would greenlight $1.8 billion in tax breaks to the film industry over 15 years because the proposal would give nothing away in the upcoming two years.
Assembly Bill 238 would massively expand Nevada’s film tax credit program to support the build out and operation of a 31-acre film hub currently referred to as the Summerlin Production Studios Project after the Las Vegas neighborhood where it would be located. Sony Pictures, Warner Bros Entertainment, and Howard Hughes Holdings are attached to the project.
Largest public subsidy in state history makes legislative debut

 
The bill, which received a policy hearing in early February, was heard by the Assembly’s finance committee on Friday.
AB 238 would set aside $120 million in film tax credits annually for 15 years — $95 million for productions at the Summerlin studio and $25 million for productions not tied to the studio. That’s a twelvefold increase over the state’s current film tax credit program, which is capped at $10 million annually.
But the increase wouldn’t kick in until July 2028. That means the Legislature does not have to consider the $95 million in tax credits as part of the biennium budget it is currently working on  Lawmakers would only have to consider a relatively small $206,000 fiscal note submitted by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, whose Nevada Film Office wants additional staff to administer the program.
“This has no impact on the current budget,” emphasized Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, who is sponsoring the bill with Assemblymember Danielle Monroe-Moreno.
But at least one lawmaker raised the possibility that economic uncertainties may linger beyond the upcoming biennium cycle.
“Let’s say that we get yet another Economic Forum with a similar outlook that we had last week,” said Assemblymember Natha Anderson, referring to a $151 million reduction in Nevada’s expected revenue forecast amid sharp economic volatility driven by Trump administration economic policies. “Is this date set in stone? Or will there be discussion about possibly pushing it back again?”
Jauregui responded that an amendment is currently being drafted proposing “additional guardrails.” She did not elaborate, saying the language is still being finalized.
Legislative staff noted that $110 million, the amount the $10 million program would expand by, represents about 1.8% of the state general fund after tax credits.
As lawmakers mull massive expansion of program, WWE offers glimpse of how film tax credits work

Lawmakers in the hearing discussed WrestleMania 41 and related events, which last month was approved to receive $4.2 million in transferable film tax credits. As the Nevada Current reported last month, Wrestlemania’s application illuminates how the program currently operates.
Assemblymember Shea Backus asked legislative staff what the WWE would have received under the provisions of AB 238. The bill, in addition to raising the annual cap, also changes the calculations used to determine the amount of transferable film tax credits each production can receive.
Chief Principal Deputy Fiscal Analyst Michael Nakamoto calculated that Wrestlemania would have qualified for $8.3 million in transferable film tax credits, nearly double what it received under the program as it exists today.
Backus noted that $8.3 million exceeds the amount WWE estimated it would spend on local labor and businesses. On its end, WWE estimates that its Wrestlemania events generate $200 million in economic activity for the host city.
Jauregui pushed back on the narrative of the bill as a giveaway, saying it requires investment of private dollars into the state and is a job creation bill.
“The legislation will generate $3 billion in annual economic activity,” she claimed. “That is Wrestlemania 15 times a year.”
Added Monroe-Moreno, “We have a responsibility to find ways to diversify our revenue streams in the state of Nevada. As the fiscal leader of this committee, I would have never put my name on a bill if I didn’t believe it provided a pathway for us to do that.”
AB 238 is one of two film tax credit expansion bills introduced this legislative session. The other is Senate Bill 220, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Roberta Lange.
SB 220 received a policy hearing last month and was referred to the Senate Finance Committee where it has not been scheduled for a hearing. Lange could not be reached for comment on the status of her bill.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SandraJauregui-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-12 08:08:49.344448

SPRINGFIELD — Amid the annual bustle at the Illinois Capitol during the legislative session’s midpoint, a sea of color and singing filled the rotunda on a sunny March day.

Attendees of the 2025 Native American Summit, organized by the Chicago American Indian Community Collaborative, were draped in regalia and leading a drum ceremony for the first time in an Illinois that was home to a federally recognized tribe.

And it was happening amid a backdrop of Native American groups working to secure passage of a bill that would ban what they say is offensive imagery in Illinois school mascots.



[jnews_element_embedplaylist scheme=""dark"" playlist=""https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFV90vte2nwzxesrQ51ErZ64TaedQf0W&feature=shared"" playlist_limit=""4""]



“Our identity has been frozen in time, and it’s going to stay frozen in time as long as we’re portrayed as mascots and things of the past,” said Matt Beaudet, a citizen of the Montauk Tribe of Indians who was in Springfield to advocate for the bill’s passage.

Andrew Johnson, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and executive director of the Native American Chamber of Commerce of Illinois, explained the importance of attire.

“We will refer to the clothes that we wear – the traditional clothes that we wear – as regalia. It is something that is honored. It has been passed down,” Johnson said. “There are reasons for wearing the particular items that are there. So, we have that term, ‘regalia.’ It's built and has the bedrock of respect and honor.”

How natives are often portrayed as mascots in school logos throughout the state, however, has a more detrimental effect of “costuming,” he said.

“It really is not a sense of honor there,” he said. “It is not a sense of history. In fact, it's a perversion of history to think that these mascots are maintaining any kind of that memory of Native people.”

Johnson and Beaudet are part of a working group convened by state Rep. Maurice West, D-Rockford, that’s at the forefront on Native American issues at the Capitol.

In the past several years, Native American advocacy groups have scored what they call major victories in state government.

The state has agreed to return tribal land in northern Illinois, required schools to teach Native culture, allowed high school students to wear cultural and religious items during graduation, and streamlined the process of repatriation and reburial of Native American remains and artifacts.

This year’s top priority would require K-12 schools to pick new logos and mascots by July 2026 to replace any that have Native American names and imagery by 2030. That measure passed the House 71-40 on April 10 and is awaiting action in the Senate in the session’s final three weeks.

If it becomes law, it will mark the latest in a series of policy wins for Native groups that have been working at the Capitol for measures they say go a long way toward righting historic wrongs.

The return of stolen land

The most recent bill to earn the governor’s signature returns stolen land to the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation. Gov. JB Pritzker signed that measure nearly a year after the Prairie Band became the state’s first federally recognized tribe in April 2024.

Illinois has a well-documented history as a removal state, meaning Native Americans were forcibly removed multiple times, including through the Trail of Tears. The Prairie Band Potawatomi’s land in DeKalb County was erroneously declared “abandoned” by the U.S. government and sold at auction in 1849 because Chief Shab-eh-nay had temporarily left the land to visit relatives in Kansas.

For decades, the nearly 1,500 acres had been state park land. State Sen. Mark Walker, D-Arlington Heights, helped usher the measure through the legislature before its ultimate passage in January following heated debate and a narrow 63-41 vote in the waning hours of session. Walker also sponsored the measure focusing on repatriation and reburial of Native remains.

“These two issues, the one about a reservation and the one about Indian burials, came to my attention as two really difficult issues to solve,” Walker said. “And they've been around the state probably 30-40 years.”

The legislative win for the Prairie Band Potawatomi was years in the making, a product of organized lobbying and coordination. Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick, tribal chairman of the Prairie Band and Shab-eh-nay’s descendant, was a mainstay at the Capitol in the lead-up to the passage of the measure.

“This moment reflects the power of collaboration and the shared desire to build a future rooted in justice and respect,” Rupnick said in a statement following Pritzker’s March signing of the bill. “Illinois has shown true courage and vision by leading the way in the Land Back movement, demonstrating that healing and reconciliation are possible.”

Even with the land transfer measure passed, the Prairie Band’s involvement in state policymaking isn’t going away.

“We, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, being the first tribe to have some of our unceded treaty lands reaffirmed here in the state, have tried to be very involved in issues here within the state,” said Raphael Wahwassuck, a council member for the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.

Wahwassuck is also a member of West’s working group and is pushing to secure passage of the mascot ban, among other policy changes.

“I hear counterarguments about how 'oh we're honoring' or 'this is our tradition,' and I just don't empathize with those because there's better ways you can honor an individual or a group of people,” he said of the portrayal of Native Americans as school mascots.

Advocacy evolution

The mascot ban before the Senate is not a new proposal – even for its House sponsor. West, the Rockford Democrat, first tried to pass legislation in 2020 that would ban Native mascots in K-12 schools, but he changed his plans upon a call from Johnson.

While Johnson relayed to West that mascots are an issue, he and other advocates wanted to prioritize something else: requiring schools to teach Native history.

“The posture I have for my working groups is I'm the chauffer,” West said. “When I meet with them, they tell me what they want to do, and I simply share with them if there's a path forward, and if there is a path, we start driving.”

That measure, sponsored by West, was signed into law in 2023, with the requirement taking effect this school year.

Les Begay, a working group member, citizen of the Diné Nation and leader of the Indigenous People’s Day Coalition, said in general, Illinoisans don’t know much about Native Americans. That’s why measures such as the Mascot ban and history requirement are so important, the tribal leaders said.

“There's so many people in Illinois that have been born here that know nothing about Cahokia,” Begay said, referring to a state-managed UNESCO World Heritage site located in St. Clair County.



[caption id=""attachment_66071"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1140""] Pictured is the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in St. Clair County. (Capitol News Illinois photo by Beth Hundsdorfer)[/caption]



Cahokia Mounds, in Collinsville, is home to what was the largest pre-Columbian site north of Mexico. The site was abandoned before Europeans arrived on the continent, but at the height of its population in 1250, there were more people living there than in London, England.

Johnson was part of the successful push to pass the Native education measure in 2023, testifying to the importance of teaching Native history.

“This is one of the many examples where the lack of proper education has deprived our citizens of discovering the full extent of the complexity, interrelations and impact of the people who originally inhabited this land and who continue to live here today,” Johnson said at the time.

After Johnson reached out to West, he found people from other Native organizations throughout the state, along with citizens and representatives of federally recognized tribes, who wanted to collaborate.

“I might not be a Native American, but I'm a Black man with my own history, and I am able to empathize with how they are feeling, so that's what, that's what keeps me going,” West said.

For many, the policy pushes are the latest front in decades of advocating for Native culture.

When Begay studied at the University of Kansas in the 1970s, he was exposed to the American Indian Movement, an organization that gained national attention for occupying Alcatraz Island, the Trail of Broken Treaties and providing grassroots support services for Native Americans.

While members of the working group acknowledged the movement “crossed the line a couple times,” AIM and the era’s activism had a lasting impact on some.

“The AIM leaders that originally were based out of Minnesota, they came to the university where I was and spoke once, and I just – after that I just wanted to get more involved,” Begay said.

Begay worked on Native issues with people at Haskell Indian Nations University, a Native American college in the same city as the University of Kansas. In 2016, he joined the board of the American Indian Center, one of the largest centers for urban Native Americans in the country.

Since retiring, Begay has had even more time to work on issues he’s passionate about, like advocating to change the name of Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day. Illinois passed a law in 2017 recognizing “Indigenous Peoples Day” as the last Monday in September each year, but it has not replaced Columbus Day on the official calendar of state holidays.

Beaudet, a lawyer, volunteered with the Native American Rights Fund in the 2000s, helping tribes and Native Americans with legal cases.

He said the issue of Native mascots is something that crops up for him every so often, like at Lane Tech College Prep where he sat on the school’s council and successfully helped advocate to get rid of their mascot, the “Indians.”

He also shared a personal example of the negative effects of Native imagery in Illinois school mascots. Beaudet was exposed to stereotypical depictions of Natives when he attended Archbishop Weber High School in Chicago, the home of the “Red Horde.” Beaudet said showing up for away games in high school brought racism with it.

[caption id=""attachment_66306"" align=""alignleft"" width=""150""] The Red Horde logo for the former Archbishop Weber High School in Chicago.[/caption]

“When we showed up, it was ‘massacre the Horde,’” Beaudet said. “They would have a Native mannequin hanging from the stands or being dragged, supposedly dead, across the field. So, it always brings up a moral, I guess to use the word, visceral response.”

Johnson, who worked for the American Indian Center from 2011-2015 as chief financial officer then eventually its executive director, moved to Illinois from California in the mid-1990s.

“Joining the American Indian Center and hearing what's going on in other places really, really piqued my concern with what students were exposed to, what they had to endure, and really cemented my efforts to try to do something about this,” Johnson said regarding the mascot ban.

He said Native issues have come a long way in Illinois.

“I have seen a difference over the last 10 to 12 years, where it was people saying 'I didn't even know there were any Natives in Illinois itself,' and saying that with all degree of seriousness related to it,” Johnson said.

Now, Johnson said, legislative moves are showing how much progress is being made.

Future advocacy

While the mascot ban is still unsettled, working group members are already individually considering legislation for next session, though there is no consensus yet at a group level.

Marne Smiley, a citizen of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe and a working group member, said she provides data and insight to the group as a reference about other Native Americans’ priorities. The data is collected through her role at the Chicago American Indian Community Collaborative, or CAICC, which has organized the annual Native American Summit since 2023.

According to one survey from CAICC, there are three issues Native people generally care about most: children, youth and families; mental health; and access to affordable housing.

Johnson said housing and codifying the Indian Child Welfare Act are two things he’ll likely be pushing for in the next legislative session.

The Indian Child Welfare Act, or ICWA, is a federal law that says Native families are the preferred placement for where Native children removed from their homes are placed. So, children would preferably be moved in with a family in their tribe or to an extended family member instead of putting the child in the foster care system.

Johnson said he’s interested in codifying ICWA in Illinois statute in case of changes to federal law.

A 2023 study from Children and Youth Services Review about the effectiveness of ICWA touched on how Native American children were “overrepresented in the foster care system.” A 16-state survey in 1978, the same year that ICWA became law, showed 85% of Native children in foster care were placed in non-Native homes.

Under another federal law, the Native American Graves and Repatriation Act, tribal nations like the Prairie Band Potawatomi work closely with places like the Illinois State Museum and universities to return or reinter human remains.

Begay said he’s interested in strengthening protections under NAGPRA on a state level.

Beyond NAGPRA, other Native interests could be advanced at the federal level as well.

U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin reintroduced legislation April 29 that would require the National Park Service to study Cahokia Mounds to determine whether it should become a National Park, a designation he’s been trying to secure for Cahokia for years.

Lori Belknap is the state’s site director at Cahokia, after having worked there for 18 years, first joining as a student and volunteer then eventually working her way up.

“So many people I've spoken to over the years, in all those different capacities, have said ‘I didn't even know this was here,’” Belknap said. “You know, they heard about it on TV or they came when they were a kid for a field trip, just a lot of different information.”

Belknap said the site has recently averaged about 200,000 visitors per year, despite funding challenges and the fact that the visitor’s center has been closed for mechanical updates.

“I know it's a sacred site to the Native culture, and we're just trying to do the best we can to honor that and be good stewards of the site, for the right now,” Belknap said.

After a recent central Illinois case that gained national media attention, prompting almost-daily protests, this project sought to engage diverse rural communities with information that brings neighbors together and moves us forward.

Managed by Press Forward Springfield, this project enlisted three central Illinois media outlets to produce impactful news coverage on the disparities and tensions within and among the region's diverse communities while maintaining editorial independence.

The New Mexico Aging and Long-Term Services Department unveiled the “Talk to Me” program in October 2024 at the Annual Conference on Aging in Albuquerque. Brian Garcia, a contractor working with the ALTSD, told Source NM that the program has since expanded and he and his team have spent the last several months traveling to senior centers across the state to connect with older New Mexicans. They were in Las Cruces the week of May 6, and have also recently visited Farmington and Clovis.
Seniors sign up for a time slot online and then spend about 15 to 20 minutes sharing stories from their lives. Garcia has flash cards with prompts to encourage a conversation, with questions such as:
“What has given you purpose in your life? What gives you hope? What advice would you give to your younger self?” 
Participants can also talk about whatever they want.
The conversations are recorded, formatted and then sent back to contributors or their families several weeks later.


Join the conversation
If you or a loved one are interested in contributing to the state’s oral history project, check upcoming recording locations online at https://www.talktomenm.org/. 
Next session:

May 23, 2025 at 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Isleta Elder Center, 1005 Tribal Rd. 140, Isleta Village Proper, NM 87022



“We’re really trying to give senior New Mexicans around the state a platform to voice their stories and experiences,” Garcia said.
Austin told Source NM that he was interested in recording some of his stories because he likes to write short vignettes about people he’s met throughout his life and this project aligned with his interests. 
“There’s two reasons I came here. The one is to just fulfill the requirement, come and chitchat,” he said. “But the other one is… I write different things, I write what I call vignettes of life.”
Garcia added that the Talk to Me program is also a way to connect older New Mexicans with the senior centers in their communities and the services they provide for free, such as in-person meals, delivered meals, homemaking services, transportation, social events and more. 
Garcia said the plan is to return to towns later in the year to collect and record more stories as people become more aware of the program.

She wasn’t thinking about years-long wait lists for a child care provider. Or how the astronomical cost would sideline her career. 
But that’s the reality for Minnesota parents who face the nation’s third most expensive infant care, at $1,800 a month, behind Massachusetts and Washington D.C., according to data from the Economic Policy Institute. Child care for a 4-year-old is slightly cheaper, but still $1,500 a month, or $18,000 per year and unaffordable for a typical family in Minnesota, where the median household income is $87,556.
Fitzgerald, like many people when they have children, was forced to adjust her life accordingly.
Fitzgerald and her husband, who were living in St. Paul at the time, relied on his roughly $80,000 salary after she decided to leave the workforce to take care of her babies. They were born in quick succession, and both needed stays in the neonatal intensive care unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fitzgerald sought a respite by enrolling them in child care part-time.
“We had our first two kids so close together, it kind of gave me more one-on-one time with them,” she said. “They were both babies, and it was good for me to be at home and nursing one, and the other could go to daycare one or two days of the week.”
For her then-infant children to attend part-time at Tierra Encantada, a Spanish immersion child care, Fitzgerald said her monthly bill was $2,366, which was more expensive than her mortgage. Her parents had to chip in to cover the expense.
After a year and about $30,000 later, she and her husband moved to the outskirts of the Twin Cities metro, where they settled into a larger home and her husband secured a higher-paying job.
The high cost of Minnesota child care, Fitzgerald said, encouraged a series of life-changing decisions. She left the workforce. Her husband found a more lucrative job. They moved out of St. Paul. And, after a third child was born during this time, they undertook a medical procedure to ensure they wouldn’t have more children.
‘Broken system’
Ann McCully, executive director at Child Care Aware of Minnesota, said the Fitzgeralds’ experience is not unique.
McCully said Child Care Aware, which receives state and federal funding, works with some parents who will refuse raises at work so they can stay below the income ceiling on child care subsidies.
The situation is so dire, she said, that some families won’t have more children even if they want them. 
“What I’m hearing more than I ever have before is people saying, ‘We’re holding off on having a second child or having a child because we know we can’t afford child care,’” McCully said.
The problem, McCully said, is that the child care market is uniquely broken — there are seemingly no winners: Parents are paying bills that often surpass their mortgages; providers are barely breaking even; and child care workers are taking home low wages despite the importance and stress of their work.
Statewide, child care workers made about $15.65 an hour in 2024, according to Minnesota Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics. The earnings don’t cover the calculated cost of living for a single person, and positions in food preparation, dry cleaning and animal training all reported a higher wage than those in child care. The state Department of Employment and Economic Development connects the low wages to a shortage of qualified caregivers.
Expensive infant care has plagued Minnesota parents for decades, in part because of regulations that require caregivers to oversee a fewer number of infants for safety, McCully said. In Minnesota, the ratio is 4:1 for children up to 16 months old at licensed child care centers. 
McCully said it’s comparable to a single parent raising quadruplets. “Can you imagine?” she asked.
A decade ago, the Star Tribune produced Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting that detailed deaths in poorly regulated home-based child care centers. 
Minnesota is now among the strictest states for child care regulations, according to a report from the Knee Regulatory Research Center at West Virginia University, but the stringent requirements have led to higher prices.
The Minnesota Child Care Association earlier this year advised against a Republican proposal that would have allowed teenage workers and unsupervised volunteers to count for the adult-to-child ratio. The organization wrote that the proposed changes were dangerous, and lawmakers should instead provide resources so care centers can hire better qualified teachers and increase accessibility for care.
According to EPI, just 5.5% of Minnesota families can afford infant care, based on a federal standard that says a family should pay no more than 7% of household income on child care.

Think Small, a child care advocacy group, says they work with families spending as much as 40% or more of their income on child care. In one case, for instance, a south Minneapolis family spends $1,350 per month — $16,200 per year — despite an annual income of just $40,000. 
If Minnesota implemented a policy to cap a family’s child care expenses at 7% of income, the typical family would save $14,000 per year, and 29,000 more parents could opt for the workforce instead of staying home, according to the EPI analysis.
Former Gov. Mark Dayton in 2015 proposed universal pre-K, an estimated $348 million investment that would have granted every 4-year-old in the state access to early learning programs. At the time, parents were paying about $11,000 per year on child care — a figure that continued to grow in the years that followed. Dayton couldn’t harness legislative support.
Now, Gov. Tim Walz frequently touts his mission to make Minnesota the best state in the nation to raise children. He has signed into law free school meals, a Child Tax Credit and Paid Family and Medical Leave. 
But if expensive child care persists, he’ll struggle to turn that mission into a legacy. 
Alexandra Fitzsimmons, policy director at Children’s Defense Fund of Minnesota, pointed to “significant investments” made in 2023, when the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party controlled the Legislature.
The new money in 2023 increased the number of subsidized slots for lower income children by about 19,000, according to state data, bringing the total to an estimated 55,000. Some qualifying parents, however, say the process is a bureaucratic morass of paperwork that requires constantly having to prove you don’t make more than the income cap. And in any case, Minnesota is home to more than 330,000 children under age five, which means the subsidized slots aren’t available for most middle class families.
For the parents of young children, help is almost certainly not on the way this year. A few Minnesota lawmakers have proposed new spending, but the state’s grim budget outlook makes a significant investment in child care unlikely.
Minnesota also receives more than $200 million per year from the federal government to fund child care. President Donald Trump proposed cutting this funding in his first term, and Republicans are more focused than ever on cuts to social programs to pay for tax cuts, which means even that relatively modest federal help could be threatened. 
Status: Waitlisted
While affording child care is one challenge, finding an available spot at a reliable center is another. McCully said parents are planning their future children around available spots at nearby care centers.
“It’s certainly not the kind of family planning we wanted to be involved in,” she said.
About two years ago, Fitzgerald moved to Bayport, a small town near the Wisconsin border, where she and her husband found a better place to fit their growing family — her third child was born during the house hunt. Fitzgerald said she struggled to locate a reliable child care and faced lengthy waitlists.
“It took me a very long time to get in anywhere,” Fitzgerald said. “I was calling people, and this was two years ago, people were saying, ‘We are waitlisted until 2026, 2025.’ I was like, ‘Alright, so basically I had to get my baby on the list before they’re even born.’ It’s insane the lack of options that you have.”
Fitzgerald eventually scored a spot through a lottery draw. Without it, she estimated the monthly cost of full time child care for all three of her children to range from $3,500 at a church she previously used, to about $8,000 for a private option. Her mortgage is currently about $3,400 a month, she said.
A view from the inside
Bobby Schmitz, a parent in St. Paul, said he and his wife reserved a spot at Common Roots Montessori School when they were three months pregnant.
Schmitz’ son has been going to the same care provider since he was 16 months old, which is the earliest the Montessori school allows. Schmitz said he and his wife reserved his spot while scoping out the neighborhood provider — 19 months in advance.
“We just got lucky because of our ignorance, really,” he said.
  Tera Dornfeld and Bobby Schmitz push their son Linus Schmitz, 3, on the swings at the park after picking him up at daycare Friday, May 9, 2025.
Now they’re expecting a baby in July, and Schmitz said the school was among the first to know —  he’s already reserved a spot for his daughter in 2027.
In addition to sending his children to the Common Roots Montessori School, Schmitz joined its nine-member board last August as a way to give back. He said his responsibilities include approving the budget and ensuring the school is sustainably funded by using a mix of grants and other sources. The majority of the operational budget is covered by tuition, he said.
His involvement as a board member does not come with a discount for his 3-year-old son’s care, which Schmitz said costs about $19,000 annually.
Schmitz’s experience of the inner workings of the school educated him on how the child care industry is working with super low margins, and he said it’s clear no one is getting rich providing care.
“Being on the board, I see the conversations on what the tradeoffs are for every dollar and how laser focused [providers] are for how to make it the best place for the kids, and the best environment for staff,” he said. 
The cost is worth it, Schmitz said: “For me it’s a no-brainer to have my kids there because of the consistency, because of the thoughtfulness that I’ve seen. It’s hard enough to have a kid away from his parents all day long.”
Schmitz said paying one child care bill isn’t a “budget buster,” but he and his wife’s combined annual earnings of roughly $200,000 will be stretched when their daughter is enrolled and their annual bill increases.
Anticipating the additional cost, Schmitz said he is starting to save money now so they can pay for two kids in child care — he’s preparing to pay $40,000 a year.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG_8910-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-12 09:05:03.915300

Attorneys for transgender young people and families and the state of Alabama recently agreed to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the state's ban on gender-affirming medical care.  (Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images)This much we know: Alabama’s gender-affirming care ban will be law for the foreseeable future.
Attorneys for transgender young people and their families sued to overturn it. But after a three-year battle, the plaintiffs and the state moved to dismiss the lawsuit. The attorneys for the families said their clients had “to make heart-wrenching decisions that no family should ever have to make, and they are each making the decisions that are right for them.”
To be sure, the broader legal landscape looks threatening. The U.S. Supreme Court seems poised to uphold a similar ban on gender-affirming care in Tennessee. One can hardly blame parents for giving up on an unjust legal system.
But Alabama’s attorney general wants you to think there’s something far worse going on. Shortly after the dismissal, Steve Marshall claimed to have uncovered a “medical, legal, and political scandal that will be studied for decades.”
OK. What it is it?
“Key medical organizations misled parents, promoted unproven treatments as settled science and ignored growing international concern over the use of sex-change procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors,” the statement said.
This is not evidence. It’s not even anything new from the attorney general’s office. They have been making this argument in federal court for three years.
And doing a terrible job with it. During a hearing in 2022, the attorney general’s office called witnesses who had never worked with transgender children but harbored strong opinions about how to treat them. When the families called experts and medical professionals who knew something about gender dysphoria, state attorneys struggled to counter their arguments.
U.S. District Judge Liles C. Burke, a Trump appointee, soon blocked the law’s ban on puberty blockers and hormones for transgender youth.
But the partisan hacks above Burke tilted the table toward the state and away from common decency. U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa lowered the standard of review in the case to pretend the state’s witnesses were as knowledgeable as the plaintiffs’, mocking the word “expertise.”
And empowering Marshall to make some questionable assertions.
European countries have reconsidered standards of care for transgender youth. But almost none of them have banned gender-affirming care outright like Alabama has. The NHS in England last year ended new prescriptions for puberty blockers following the release of the Cass Report, which has come under sharp attack from experts. But unlike Alabama, the NHS allowed children receiving puberty blockers to stay on them. A law formalizing the ban in the country never passed.
Health care organizations condemned the NHS’ decision.  Because the “unproven treatments” statement is misleading. Two dozen medical organizations endorse gender-affirming care as safe and effective, and it has a high satisfaction rate among patients.
“Certainly, the science is quickly evolving and will likely continue to do so,” Burke wrote in his May 2022 opinion. “But this is true of almost every medical treatment regimen. Risk alone does not make a medication experimental.”
That leaves us with “key medical organizations misled patients.”
Step back to the 2022 hearing on the law. Medical providers who work with transgender children testified under oath about the many steps in evaluating gender dysphoria. There are several rounds of counseling with parents and children before medication is even considered.
Some kids may not need medical intervention. Some do, which triggers further rounds of evaluation. Treatment exists on a spectrum. And doctors discuss risks with families.
“They are not 100% guaranteed to happen,” Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, formerly of UAB, told the court in 2022. “That has to be weighed with the entire team around the gravity of that person’s gender dysphoria.”
Doctors testified under oath that they give families the most complete pictures of treatment they can. If Marshall has evidence that they misled these families, he should enter it into the court record as these professionals did. As of this writing, he has not. Which suggests how flimsy the state’s case is.
The problem here isn’t parents protecting their children from assault by the state of Alabama. It’s the state terrorizing a small and vulnerable group of young people.
They banned them from playing sports. They cut off their health care. Every act aims to drive them out of the public sphere. And our leaders seem fine with the destruction they’re leaving behind.
So we will have to live with the ban for now.
But transgender people will still be here when the authors of these laws are gone. Eventually the ban will fall like any other attempt to restrain reality.
Yet how many children will suffer before that day? How many Alabama families will have to uproot and build new lives outside the state to get this critical care to their loved ones?
And when families can’t, how many tragedies will result?
That’s the scandal. And it’s the politicians, not the doctors, who bear the blame.

HB 8, sponsored by Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, would ban the distribution of tobacco, tobacco products, electronic nicotine delivery systems, e-liquids, and alternative nicotine products through vending machines. It would also create a licensing and fee requirement for retailers intending to sell these products.
“These products are harming our young people. We’re not dealing with something that is a healthy product. This product is not a product that we should be inhaling into our lungs. So, we are just trying to protect our children,” said Sen. David Sessions, R-Grand Bay, who presented the bill to the body.

The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 28-5. The House concurred with Senate changes to the bill later in the day, sending the bill to Gov. Kay Ivey.
Similar bills meant to address concerns about youth access to vaping devices have been introduced over several years by Drummond. Drummond, who was present on the Senate floor during its passage, received a standing ovation from the chamber.

“Today, your hard work is paid off,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, who has sponsored similar legislation in the past.. “The state of Alabama appreciates you. We all say thank you for taking care of our kids, the superintendents, all the school children throughout, and all the ones that are doing some bad stuff. They don’t even know they’re doing bad stuff because that study’s not out there, and there’s not any money to enforce this. This allows that to happen.”
Rates of smoking tend to be higher in Alabama, with just over 14% of Alabama adults being current smokers in 2023, with 9.5% smoking every day and 4.8% smoking some days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 12% of adults smoke every day or some days nationally.
Rates of high school students using electronic vapes in Alabama are also higher than nationally and have increased since 2015, when about 2% of high school students used an electronic vaping device daily, according to CDC’s High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey data. By 2021, that increased to 8% of Alabama high school students reporting using vapes every day, compared to 5% nationally.
A University of Southern California 2025 study suggests that e-cigarette use in the past year declined in U.S. youths, but there was a significant increase in nicotine pouch usage from 2023 to 2024.
The bill would also establish the Tobacco Licensing and Compliance Fund; provide for an advisory board to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, and require tobacco retailers to post signage warning of the dangers of tobacco product use. The legislation also includes measures aimed at schools, directing the Alabama State Board of Education to develop a model policy for vape awareness, education and prevention programs in public K-12 schools. Local boards of education will be required to adopt policies based on this model.
During the Senate floor discussions, Sessions said he was concerned with the increasing use of vaping products among young people and the health consequences associated with them.  
“We have an epidemic going on in this state with our young people. They are getting sick,” he said, claiming young individuals have required hospitalization due to the use of counterfeit products.
The Senate also addressed concerns about the bill’s potential impact on businesses that legally sell tobacco and vape products. An amendment proposed by Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro and approved by the chamber allows the sale of FDA-approved products in convenience stores if these stores obtain the necessary permits and comply with verification requirements.  
“This amendment would definitely fall still under the laws of this particular bill,” Singleton said, saying that the amendment does not weaken the bill’s intended regulation.

‘”In 2023, close to 30 percent of Southwest Gas’ companywide damages were due to homeowners and contractors not calling 811 before excavation,” says the utility’s website.
“‘Call 811’ line marking service is free for residential and commercial digging jobs of all sizes and for all types of projects, and is the law.” 
While free to the caller, the service comes at a cost to the customer. 
From June 2022 to May 2023, line location expenses paid by customers totaled just under $11.7 million in Southern Nevada and about $2 million in the north. 
The utility won approval to recover those yearly costs as part of a $59.1 million general rate hike that went into effect last year. Now Southwest Gas is asking for authority to recover an estimated $3.5 million a year for the next two years. 
Southwest Gas contends it’s not technically seeking a rate hike, but rather permission from the PUC to establish a regulatory account “to track the actual level of line location-related expenses the Company incurs. This will allow the Company to recover its actual costs – no more, no less – at a future date after consideration by the PUCN,” spokesperson Amy Washburn said via email. 
In testimony provided to the PUC, utility executives contend the cost of line location has skyrocketed since 2016, with the utility recovering a smaller portion of the expense.  
  (Source: Southwest Gas filing with PUCN)
David Chairez, regulatory manager for the Nevada Attorney General’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, testified to the PUC that the utility’s holding company, Southwest Gas Holdings, “is doing very well… with net income of $261 million, an increase of $19 million” over the previous year, while its operation and maintenance expenses per customer are unchanged.
Chairez argues the PUC should deny the application to establish a regulatory asset for line locating expenses because it’s an attempt to engage in single-issue ratemaking –  legislative or commission actions that set or affect rates outside of a general rate case. The practice is permitted in some cases, such as when it’s required by statute, or because of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, that results in unforeseen expenses for the utility. 
Opposition to single-issue ratemaking is based on the premise that a utility’s revenue requirement is calculated on aggregate costs, rather than one cost related to a single component of its operations. 
Rates are designed to cover a utility’s costs and provide for a fair and reasonable return on investment. Chairez argues the proposed rate solely benefits Southwest Gas shareholders. 
When requests from Nevada’s Consumer Advocate for single-issue ratemaking would have benefitted the customer, Southwest Gas and the PUC opposed it, Chairez testified, including when President Donald Trump, in his first term, lowered corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, resulting in a windfall for the utility.  
The utility, which enjoyed the tax relief immediately, delayed passing the savings of Trump’s corporate tax adjustment to ratepayers for nine months until its next rate case, during which time customers were paying rates that were based on the utility having to pay a higher federal tax rate than it was actually paying. That cost Southern Nevada customers $7.2 million in savings and Northern Nevada customers $1.3 million by waiting, Chairez estimated. 
The Bureau of Consumer Protection’s position is at odds with that of PUC staff, who support the application. 
“Southwest Gas asserts it has experienced a dramatic increase in the level of line locate requests in recent years,” PUC staffer John Brownrigg testified, and recommended that regulators approve the utility’s request to account separately for the increased line location costs now, and include the expense in the utility’s next general rate case. 
Unlike electric utilities, Southwest Gas is not bound by law to file a general rate case every three years, but rather at its discretion. 
The average customer currently pays $15.20 a year for line location efforts. The utility’s request, if approved by the PUC, would eventually add about $5 a year. 
Chairez, in his testimony, notes Southwest Gas is required to comply with the ‘Call Before You Dig’ statute “and that obligation will not change if the PUC denies the request.”
Southwest Gas is also currently asking state lawmakers to allow it to engage in alternative ratemaking, a policy shift that could pose a cost burden to customers, according to opponents of the legislation, because it avoids the transparency of a general rate case.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1179196470_WEB-e1746992717332-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-05-12 08:08:49.344448

A common counter to raising taxes on the rich is that they will simply flee their home states to jurisdictions with friendlier tax codes. While some tax migration is inevitable, the wealthy that move to avoid taxes represent a tiny percentage of their own social class. The top one percent are incentivized not to move because of family, social networks and local business knowledge.
Our findings support the case against tax flight: The number of individuals with a net worth of at least seven-figures continued to expand in both Massachusetts and Washington after tax hikes. The millionaire class has grown by 38.6 percent in Massachusetts and 46.9 percent in Washington over the past two years. The seven-figure clubs in those states saw their wealth grow by $580 million and $748 million, respectively.
Not only did millionaires not flee the states imposing new taxes, but the states became richer. The four percent surtax on million-dollar incomes in Massachusetts and the seven percent tax on capital gains of $250,000 or more in Washington State succeeded in raising revenue — $2.2 billion for FY 2024 and $1.2 billion in its first two years of implementation, respectively.
These new resources have been invested in educational programs that support early learning, childcare, and free school lunches and community college. In the case of Massachusetts, some of the revenue collected is earmarked towards public transportation.
That experience contrasts with the failure of the Great Kansas Tax Cut Experiment that began in 2012. The Sunflower State lagged behind its neighbors in a number of economic categories and experienced revenue shortfalls. The experiment was abandoned five years later.
Lastly, the brief looks at the revenue potential of a wealth tax aimed at ultra-high net worth individuals. We identified individuals with $50 million or more in wealth across four states and estimated how much different taxes could raise. These individuals have the liquidity to pay and, as my colleague and former tax attorney Bob Lord has argued, need to have their rate of accumulation curbed.  
A two percent wealth tax on this class of ultra-high net worth individuals has the potential to raise $7.4 billion in Massachusetts, $21.9 billion in New York, $700 million in Rhode Island, and $8.2 billion in Washington. This is a significant source of potential revenue that can be invested in a green transition, permanently affordable housing, and universal healthcare.
At the time of writing, legislators in Washington State are awaiting Governor Bob Ferguson’s signature to pass new taxes to help bring down their $16 billion budget deficit. Even a one-time three percent wealth tax could bring down the deficit from $16 billion to $3.7 billion.
We have witnessed a counterrevolution over the past 50 years where the nation’s wealth and income has concentrated at an extreme level in the hands of a small but powerful minority. They use their resources to increase their access to the state, buy up more assets, and squeeze the living standards of the working-class. We have the policy tools at our disposal to reverse this trend. Let’s put progressive taxation to work.

Are we in a recession in Connecticut? The short answer is probably not (at the moment), but we can’t be certain. 
Technically, only the National Bureau of Economic Research — a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group — can make the call on whether the United States economy is in a recession or not. And typically, it does so only after we’ve been in one for a while. 
A panel of eight NBER-selected economists, known as the Business Cycle Dating Committee, looks at a number of different data points and confers over whether the economy is expanding or receding — whether we’re in an “expansion” or a “recession.” The committee also assigns start and end dates for each recession. Retroactively, of course.
The most straightforward data point is the growth rate of gross domestic product, or GDP. GDP is the value of all the goods and services we produce, aka the size of our economy. If the GDP growth rate is negative for two consecutive quarters, it’s likely the economy is in a recession.
But that’s not a hard and fast rule. The committee also looks at the latest trends in jobs and unemployment; personal income and consumption; industrial production, wholesaler sales and other measures. The economists take all those data points — and more — into account in deciding whether the economy is in a recession and, if so, when that recession started. 
Answering the same questions at the state level gets a little fuzzier, since recessions are generally considered national events. But there are some resources available. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia analyzes a handful of indicators to approximate economic conditions by state. You can also find charts of several relevant data points for the state on The Connecticut Mirror’s Economic Indicator Dashboard.
But what is a recession?
According to NBER, a recession is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.” This isn’t uncommon, because economic activity is cyclical. Periods of expansion approach a peak and then fall back — and then begin expanding again. 
The U.S. economy has gone through 34 recessions since 1854. During a recession, GDP might decline by 2% up to as much as 5%.
The COVID-19 recession was unusual in its short duration, but the decline in economic activity was so widespread across industries, demographic groups, geographic regions — all aspects of the economy — that the committee determined it amounted to a recession. 
The Great Depression was essentially a very, very bad recession. GDP declined 29%, unemployment reached 25%, consumer prices and wholesale prices tanked and a third of the banking system failed. 
What happens in a recession?
Day-to-day life can get pretty tough for people, businesses, government bodies and other organizations. When the economy isn’t growing, negative performance in one area can exacerbate problems in other areas. For example, if employers cut jobs, personal incomes decline and people spend less money. That can lead to trouble for consumer goods companies, services providers and myriad other businesses.
When companies see their sales decline, that forces cost-cutting on everything from staff positions to research and development. Some employers might have to shutter departments, close down locations, declare bankruptcy or simply go out of business. With fewer businesses hiring, recently unemployed people face a harder time finding a new job. 
Recessions also reduce tax receipts, meaning state and local governments have less money to spend on their operations and staff. And they’re hard on investments: The stock market and real estate property tend to lose value, and many people see their savings and retirement accounts shrink. Philanthropy and charitable organizations usually pull back on donations. And financial institutions, wary of taking on risk, often raise criteria for lending money making it harder for people to take out loans.
International trade also tends to decline during a recession, and consumer prices may come down due to lower demand for goods and services.
When — and how — does a recession end?
According to NBER’s records, U.S. recessions have run about 17 months on average. But since the 1980s, all six have lasted less than a year. A recession ends when the economy has bottomed out, or reached a “trough.” That exact point in time is decided (that’s right!) by NBER. Retroactively, of course.
Fiscal and monetary policy can help to restore the economy back to an expansion mode. 
Congress makes fiscal policy — i.e., spending and tax cuts to stimulate economic activity. Some fiscal policies, like Unemployment Insurance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, are already in place to help people who find themselves in economic distress. During a recession, participation in these programs tends to rise, which boosts spending in the economy. New fiscal stimulus, like the American Rescue Plan Act, can take longer to disperse throughout the economy.
The Federal Reserve makes monetary policy decisions also designed to stimulate demand — namely, by lowering the federal funds rate. Lower interest rates mean lower borrowing costs for people and businesses, which can stimulate consumer spending and business investment.
Lately, the Fed has actually been keeping interest rates relatively elevated. That’s because there’s a lot of uncertainty about which direction the economy will take, amid changing tariff rates and other shifts in federal economic policy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Recession_Timing_AP_2010-1024x671.jpg,,,2025-05-12 08:08:49.344448

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Problems with overcrowding have enveloped the Green Hill School juvenile detention center in Chehalis for nearly two years, leading to unsafe conditions for the minors incarcerated there and the staff tasked with overseeing them.
But Washington state lawmakers left Olympia last month without making substantial changes to address the crisis. The lack of progress was frustrating for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. 
While a new facility opening this year in Aberdeen could offer some relief, the failure to pass significant legislation on the issue means Green Hill is on track to continue housing dozens more people than it is designed to safely hold.
State Senate Human Services Committee Chair Claire Wilson, D-Federal Way said she “really felt disappointed for the young people that we let down.”
The crowding at Green Hill comes as juvenile crime has ballooned and state law has transitioned to send young adults convicted of crimes to youth detention instead of adult prison until they turn 25. 
The facility, along with Echo Glen Children’s Center in Snoqualmie, is one of the state Department of Children, Youth and Families’ two prisons for juvenile offenders.
Last year, the crowding crisis grew to the point that the state agency transferred 43 young men from Green Hill to an adult prison run by the state Department of Corrections and temporarily stopped taking in new people at the facility, a decision that drew staunch criticism and litigation.
For months, the population at Green Hill, which houses boys and men ages 17 to 25, has fluctuated between 220 and 240, despite a safe operational capacity of 180. Projections show that number rising another 100 by the end of 2026, according to Department of Children, Youth and Families Secretary Tana Senn.
Meanwhile, the agency’s assistant secretary for juvenile rehabilitation, Felice Upton, is no longer with the department, as of April 21. The circumstances of her departure were unclear. The agency declined to comment. 
Upton also previously served as superintendent at Echo Glen. 
Legislators this year earmarked money for increased security at Green Hill School and for operations at the smaller, new facility set to open next month in Grays Harbor County.
Lawmakers considered major policy changes this year to tackle the overcrowding. Two bills focused on different aspects of the issue passed the Senate before stalling in the House.
Senate Bill 5278 would have set new guidelines for transferring young people to adult prison or placing them there in the first place if youth facilities are above capacity.
Senate Bill 5296, sponsored by Wilson, would have tried to direct more youth away from detention in the first place. The measure would’ve required judges to specifically find, based on a “preponderance of the evidence,” that custody in juvenile rehabilitation was necessary because community-based placement would have been inadequate.
The bill also would have required court hearings to determine if people in youth prison should remain in custody, and expand eligibility for alternatives to incarceration.
“We seem to be very willing, if you will, to put money into a system to move our young people from JR into DOC, but not at all as willing to think about what it would take to keep young people from coming into the system in the first place,” Wilson said.
Wilson pushed to pass the two bills in tandem, as a package.
But while Senate Bill 5278, sponsored by Sen. John Braun, D-Centralia, had bipartisan support, the debate over Wilson’s proposal was fiercely partisan. Even a handful of House Democrats worried about the more lenient approach her bill offered. 
In the end, Wilson’s legislation collapsed over these concerns, and Braun’s bill fell with it.
“There was a well-worked, bipartisan bill with a controversial bill, and to hold that bill hostage because you couldn’t get the votes in your own caucus for a controversial bill, it just seems wrong-headed or even mean-spirited, frankly,” said Braun, whose district includes Green Hill.
Debate among the Dems
More than two dozen House Democrats were so frustrated Wilson’s bill didn’t get a vote, they put out a joint statement entitled “Lessons In Failure.”
“For the young people trapped in a system that prioritizes incarceration over rehabilitation, this is more than a missed opportunity — it’s a moral failure,” they wrote.
State Rep. Lauren Davis, D-Shoreline, was one of the few in her caucus pushing back on Wilson’s bill. She thinks the state needs stronger consequences to deter minors from committing crimes, which often leave their peers as victims. 
“I do not believe it is just or compassionate to allow these young people to self-destruct,” she said, noting the bill doesn’t expand the community supports needed to help young people diverted away from incarceration.
The case of a 17-year-old released from custody by a King County judge despite a criminal history before allegedly killing two teens in March further stoked opposition.
Davis said she’s “not sure what part of this is acceptable to anybody, but it should be unacceptable to anybody, and this bill would have fomented more of that.”
Davis said her views on public safety have evolved since joining the Legislature in 2019. She’s seen policies she supported result in homicides and suicides and doesn’t want to repeat those mistakes.
Her resistance toward Senate Bill 5296 did not make her popular among her colleagues, she said. 
Eric Trupin, a University of Washington researcher who for decades has worked with incarcerated youth, lamented the bill’s failure.
“I think we had an opportunity to really move our juvenile justice system in a way that would really have improved outcomes for youths,” he said. 
Still, he said concerns about a lack of services for diverted youth were valid. 
Meanwhile, Senn said Wilson’s bill wouldn’t address the existing population concerns at Green Hill. 
The debate isn’t over. The bills will likely be back next year for the 60-day legislative session.
“We’ve been working on this one for a long time,” Wilson said. “So it will come back, and hoping that Senator Braun will be responsive to bringing 5278 with it.”
Scant progress
The Legislature did make small moves to address juvenile detention needs.
Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a bill last month seeking to protect those held in the state’s juvenile detention centers from having to spend extra time in custody over “prison riot” charges. House Bill 1815 also looks to retroactively vacate those convictions. 
An analysis found most of the prison riot charges statewide were prosecuted in Lewis County, where Green Hill is located. The new law could affect sentences or convictions for half a dozen or so detainees at Green Hill, Senn said.
Trupin said the bill is important for those individuals. “But it’s not systems changing like these other two bills were,” he said.
The new state budget sets aside $25 million to run the new 48-bed detention center on the grounds of Stafford Creek Corrections Center in Aberdeen, known as Harbor Heights. The facility is set to open in phases beginning in early June, starting with at least eight young men transferring there from Green Hill and filling to capacity by fall. 
Harbor Heights will serve as a six-month rotation for young men in juvenile detention who qualify for medium security status.
While at Harbor Heights, they would build skills and participate in cognitive behavioral therapy to tackle mental health concerns. They’d then return to Green Hill or be released from custody.
“The hope is that young people will see it as an opportunity to expand their own learning and their own growth and their own development” before returning to be mentors at Green Hill, said Wilson.
The plan has drawn pushback from critics worried the former Department of Corrections facility will be dehumanizing, but officials have emphasized the Department of Children, Youth and Families will be running it with more services than adult prisons can provide.
Green Hill and Echo Glen are getting about $3.5 million each for increased security.
“I don’t think it’ll hurt,” Braun said. “We’ve put a ton of money into Green Hill in the last five years, six years. I think it’s helping. I don’t think it’s solving the problem. Fundamentally, it’s just overcrowded. They are not delivering on the promise to give these individuals the types of services they need to get back on track.”
Lawmakers also earmarked $3 million for grants to county courts to serve youth in the juvenile justice system. Another $3 million was set aside to scout new medium-security juvenile detention facilities. A top prospect has been the minimum-security Mission Creek Corrections Center for Women in Mason County, which is slated for closure.
Any new facility would be at least four years out, Senn said.
The budget is still subject to Ferguson’s approval this month.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/green-hill-school-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 07:05:10.087379

(Photo by Laura Tesler/Oregon Capital Chronicle)The idea of Greater Idaho — splitting off most of eastern Oregon to join with the state of Idaho — isn’t going to fly. It won’t happen.
So here’s another idea:
The Autonomous Area of eastern Oregon. And Western too, for good measure.
This concept was not invented in the deep recesses of a pundit’s mind. It comes from a recently introduced piece of legislation by a Republican lawmaker in the state of Washington.
Washington has a regional dynamic similar to Oregon. The bulk of its population is west of the Cascades and as a region votes clearly Democratic, while the geographically larger but less populated territory to the east votes Republican — with all the correlating social and economic considerations that implies. Washington’s east side hasn’t organized a highly visible join-Idaho effort the way Oregon’s has, but the proposal has surfaced occasionally.
A related but different idea emerged in this year’s Washington legislative session. Rep. Rob Chase, R-Spokane Valley in House Bill 2085 proposed keeping Washington state intact, and its congressional representation unchanged, but splitting most governing within the state.
The bill described it this way: “The legislature intends to divide the state into two autonomous regions, the Puget Sound region and the Columbia region, by constitutional amendment. Each region would provide regional governors, regional legislators, and regional judges. The state of Washington will remain a single state for purposes of federal election, as proposed in New York Senate Bill 2023-S3093.”
Presumably, that would mean splitting the key regional elections (both autonomous areas would have governors and legislatures, for example) while both vote under a common system for federal offices. Laws and regulations and finances would be affected as well.
Chase said of this, “We would have better representation that takes into account the ideals, principles, priorities, beliefs, and values found in the populace that it serves. Isn’t this what our Founding Fathers envisioned when establishing our Democratic Republic?”
This approach isn’t something familiar to American government: There are no formal “autonomous regions” in the United States. They’re more common in other parts of the globe, however, including the Caucasus, China and even a slice of Finland. Greenland, famously, is an autonomous region: Largely self-governing but under the national umbrella of Denmark.
On an American state level it’s an ambitious idea, but it may be within the purview of the state legislature. It probably would require a state constitutional amendment, but — because states do have some leeway in setting up their own governments — it might not require federal approval. If the legislature and voters approved, it probably (we’d have to see what the courts would say) could happen.
The bill didn’t go anywhere in the Washington legislature this year, nor should we expect any voter action. Chase said he introduced it now mainly to get a head start for a future push.
But the Greater Idaho folks have no doubt heard of it, and the idea of a similar bill introduction in Salem may be floated soon if it hasn’t been already. The process might even be simpler in Oregon: While Washington requires constitutional amendments to come from the legislature, Oregon allows them via citizen initiatives.
So how might this play out in Oregon?
Imagine the Greater Idaho group or some other organization petitioning for a constitutional amendment to be approved, or not, by the voters. This would have a considerable advantage over the kind of long-term and probably hopeless slog to change state boundaries. If structured carefully, the issue might be resolved in a single election through a change in the state constitution. If it passed, it would happen through the approval of the voters, which would give the idea powerful legitimacy statewide.
Getting most Oregonians to vote in favor, of course, would be difficult.
You’ll also notice the reference to “structured carefully.” Plenty of tricky issues would have to be addressed. We might be talking about three governors in Oregon, one for the whole state and one each for the east and the west. How do they relate to each other, and to the federal government, and what relative powers would they have? You could ask similar questions about the Legislature. Would there still be a statewide legislature, and if so, what could it and could it not do?
What might be the differences in tax and spending? What about federal money coming to the state of Oregon: How would it be divided? How would law enforcement and safety agencies coordinate? If criminal and other laws were different (which would seem to be part of the point of having an autonomous region), what about extradition? What would be the authority of whatever remained of a statewide Oregon government, because there would have to be one if only to deal with other states and the feds.
The autonomous idea is more complex than it first sounds. If Greater Idaho is watching the action across the Columbia, they may want to pay attention to how legislator Chase started to field the questions that are sure to multiply.

(Getty Images)For decades, Indiana’s Community and Home Options to Institutional Care for the Elderly and Disabled program — CHOICE, for short — has sought to keep Hoosiers out of long-term care facilities through home modifications and services like meal delivery or transportation. 
After the 2025 legislative session, it will also become a “Medicaid diversion program” in two pilot areas. 
CHOICE’s supporters don’t see the new duty as an expansion of the program, but rather codifying something it’s already doing. 
“The CHOICE program has always been a Medicaid diversion program,” said Rep. Ed Clere, R-New Albany. “This year’s legislation makes that explicit.” 
  Rep. Ed Clere, R-New Albany, speaks in committee on Tuesday, Jan. 23, 2024. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Created in 1987, CHOICE is funded entirely with state dollars, but pivoted in 2014 to focus on preventative services with updated eligibility guidelines. Additionally, the program offers services on a sliding scale, meaning that there are no income restrictions on eligibility. 
“I don’t think it should be the policy of the state to wait until people are on the brink of losing independence and in poverty before we help them try to stay in their home or in another community-based setting and avoid institutionalization,” said Clere. “… since its inception, the CHOICE program has helped countless Hoosiers maintain their independence and, as a result, their quality of life.”
Dollars are funneled through the state’s Area Agencies on Aging, which are scattered around the state. The two pilot areas will be in the eastern and western parts of the state, in areas surrounding Richmond and Terre Haute, respectively. 
Thrive West Central, in Terre Haute, will spend the next year setting the pilot up and identifying ways to prolong a Hoosier’s independence, with a special focus on fall prevention and chronic disease management. 
“We think this is a fascinating study and we think it’s great for older Hoosiers,” said Ryan Keller, the executive director of Thrive. “We think this could change the trajectory of our folks, of our aging people, going on Medicaid.” 
Other important provisions of the new law, which goes into effect in July, add dementia education services for caretakers and allows the overseeing agency to study the feasibility of realigning Indiana’s senior care organizations. The state currently has 15 providers covering 16 areas, but the geographic area and population of each varies widely. 
 Could the program decrease Medicaid costs?

Nursing homes and other institutional forms of long-term care made up 19% of the state’s Medicaid expenses in 2024, despite the fact that only 2% of the state’s enrollees used those services. 
According to the 2025 CHOICE report, the annual cost of a CHOICE enrollee is $5,203 per year. In comparison, the average nursing home resident costs the state $28,343 annually — though such care is the most expensive form of long-term care. 
Of the 5,631 Hoosiers who used CHOICE in 2024, 3,439 were Medicaid eligible.

Earlier this year, student teams at Butler University analyzed Medicaid patient data provided by the Family and Social Services Administration with the goal of identifying underlying cost drivers. 
The students identified falls as a major health concern, concluding that more than 30% of Indiana’s seniors experienced falls annually. Injuries from such events are one of top reasons why someone transitions from independent living to institutional care. 
As outlined in a release from collaborator Parkview Health, if half of the state’s seniors participated in annual fall assessments, that alone could save the state an estimated $115 million and prevent 41 deaths each year. 
To Hannah Carlock, a vice president with RJL Solutions currently serving as interim CEO of the AAAs association, CHOICE is a natural solution to reduce Medicaid enrollment and costs.
“We’re seeing more and more people declining on Medicaid, so why don’t we really bolster the CHOICE program?” she asked. “… it’s very cost effective and, clearly, being at home you have a better quality of life.” 
In particular, CHOICE has been used as an option to prolong someone’s independence before they might need Medicaid waiver services — an especially crucial offering as thousands continue to languish on the state’s waitlists. 
In addition to falls, the Medicaid diversion pilot program seeks to target chronic disease management, such as heart disease or diabetes. 
“Even though you may have chronic, congestive heart failure or you have diabetes … those diseases can be managed to a certain degree,” said Keller. 
Carlock, Keller and Clere pointed to specific, small interventions that can help aging seniors such as:

Eliminating trip hazards like throw rugs
Putting grip pads under rugs on slippery surfaces, like tile
Putting washers and dryers on the main floor so people don’t have to carry heavy laundry baskets down a flight of stairs
Grab bars in bathrooms
Methods to track medication usage
Connecting someone to transportation and meal services

“Those two key categories just seem very natural, very intuitive, and they’re all things that are controllable in our environment,” Keller said about the Medicaid diversion pilot. “This is where we feel like we have the greatest control to go and start a dedicated diversion program so we can slow, delay or prevent folks from having these kinds of preventable accidents.”
“We really do believe that, with small interventions on the preventative side of things, that it can have huge, lasting echoes of cost savings on the backend,” he continued.
Evaluating the effectiveness of the program, and the final report, will be done by Notre Dame University’s Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities, with specific parameters set to be defined in the coming weeks.
 How will we pay for it?

Clere’s House Enrolled Act 1391 didn’t initially include “Medicaid diversion” specifically, but emerged after discussions with Clere’s peers in the General Assembly. The prospect of decreasing the state’s Medicaid commitment — Indiana’s fastest-growing and second-largest expense — became even more appealing in the last week of session after lawmakers learned of a $2 billion budget shortfall. 
But, like nearly every other spending category, CHOICE got a 5% cut in the final budget — falling from $48.8 million each year to $46.2 million. AAAs got $29.3 million of those dollars in 2024.

CHOICE is overseen by a board that meets every other month and will convene on Thursday, May 15 at 1 p.m. To learn more about the board, including its vacancies, livestreams and meeting minutes, visit the state’s website.

The senior care organizations charged with overseeing the pilot program will have to work within their existing budgets to get the project off the ground — though private partnerships could buoy their efforts. 
Keller pointed to one potential avenue for funds: the nearly $2 million AAAs left unspent in the last year. Such a reversion occurred due to the “unpredictability” of a community’s needs, Keller said, as demand varied from month-to-month. 
But AAAs will also have the chance to save some needed funds under another part of Clere’s bill: striking the requirement for some service providers to be Medicaid approved. 
With the change, “CHOICE dollars will go five times as far,” Keller said. 
Keller used building a ramp as an example. Though his community, and many others, have volunteer groups to provide free labor, they’re not approved as a provider by Medicaid. That means no CHOICE dollars can be used to purchase the needed materials. 
A Medicaid-approved provider might charge somewhere between $15,000 and $20,000 for a job that another group would do for $3,000, he said. 
“Nothing’s different … it’s the same boards, the same screws, same everything. But that’s the cost difference,” Keller said. 
Clere said that identifying which services to decouple from Medicaid approval and partnering with Notre Dame was part of the collaborative legislative process, noting that the proposal was amended a handful of times before becoming law. 
“I’m confident (decoupling) will lead to a lot more options and competition, which will provide opportunities for additional cost savings,” said Clere. 
Clere, who has been a member of the CHOICE program’s board for well over a decade, admitted that it’d become a “big part of (his) legislative focus and work.”
“I’m very passionate about it. I’ve seen the difference it can make in the lives of individuals and families,” he said, “… I’m excited about HEA 1391 and everything it represents and all of the good things that are going to come from it.”

(Getty Images)We are living in interesting times. Maybe you’ve noticed. And I’m not just talking about the vehicles in the Statehouse parking lot, or the hot history takes on social media. Hopefully, you’ve also detected the great reshuffling of priorities taking place right before our eyes.
Less money from the federal government and pervasive economic uncertainty are wreaking havoc on the state budget. Property tax relief is putting pressure on local governments to find new revenue or reduce services. And Medicaid growth is forcing smokers to pay more for their already expensive habit.
The shakeup has even come to a courtroom near you. Under the recently passed HEA 1144, some locales, notably the ever-expanding Hamilton County, will get new judicial officers. Others, like the demographically challenged Blackford County, will see theirs taken away.
All this rebalancing shows policymakers engaged in the perennial contest between trade-offs and solutions.
Thomas Sowell described the history of this contest in his classic A Conflict of Visions. According to Sowell, optimizing trade-offs is the mission of those who operate under what he terms the constrained vision of human nature, which sees us all irredeemably imperfect and lacking the capacity for solutions. The yin to this yang is Sowell’s unconstrained vision, which sees humankind as perfectible and its challenges as ultimately solvable.
Indiana lawmakers approve reduced court eliminations

HEA 1144 shows the constrained view ascendant. Lawmakers like Rep. Chris Jeter and Sen. Liz Brown recognize it is unsustainable to continually add courts without examining the system in its entirety. We can’t materialize judicial officers from thin air. So, when judges in overworked counties ask for more resources, it makes sense for lawmakers to find a way to pay for it. The simple trade-off is to cut underutilized courts.
But the unconstrained vision should not be ignored. It is indisputably a world of finite resources. There is only so much time, so much money, and so much energy to go around. And yet, over tens of thousands of years, our species has demonstrated an
uncanny ability to expand the realm of the possible. Lives have been lengthened, wealth has been created, and new sources of power have been tapped.
In the fullness of time and imagination, there may be solutions after all.
The judicial utilization problem perfectly illustrates a policy challenge that would benefit from both the constrained and unconstrained views. According to the 2024 Weighted Caseload Measures, the judiciary is operating at 102% capacity, meaning we collectively have almost exactly the right number of judges we need. It’s just that some courts are overloaded while others are underused. The simple solution is to put the underused courts to work.
I’m guessing the put-the-judges-to-work solution looks a lot better to most Hoosiers than the eliminate-the-judges-in-my-county trade-off. And fortunately, we have a model that will allow us to actively pursue the solution without settling for the trade-off.
Historically, judges “rode circuit,” traveling on horseback from town to town to hear cases. This allowed sparsely populated areas to pool their resources and create a justice system they couldn’t otherwise afford in their small frontier communities. A
vestige of this system survives in Indiana to this day: our smallest community, Ohio County, shares a circuit court with its much larger neighbor, Dearborn County.
Share and share alike
In our more urbanized society, the design problem is different, but the circuit court solution is still relevant. Today, it’s not about pooling resources but about projecting resources where they’re needed. Still, sharing what we have is the solution.
The Supreme Court has already divided the state into 26 administrative districts. With small rule changes, the judges in these districts could be allowed to hear cases across county lines. No horses required. Instead, through the magic of Zoom and the miracle of electronic filing, our existing judicial officers can do the work in their existing chambers.
In the end, Sowell’s dichotomy is a brilliant way to think about the ongoing battle of ideas, but, as he admits, not everyone has chosen a side. So, it is odd that it has become something of a mantra to say that there are no solutions, only trade-offs. Let’s
wait before we carve that in stone. Certainly, we are constrained, but we are not stagnant. Most importantly, we are not doomed to false choices.
For this reason, and with all due respect to Sowell, I prefer another classic work on trade-offs and solutions: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. When confronted with a scenario designed to guarantee failure, Kirk famously changed the conditions of the
test. Spock sacrificed himself for the benefit of his crew. They both rejected the no-win scenario. So should we.
Judging from recent comments, legislators may be on the same page. In his remarks on final passage of HEA 1144, Rep. Jeter acknowledged that there would be an ongoing effort to get our judges “in the right spots.” If that effort comes to fruition, and if
lawmakers change the conditions to make that possible, they may be more unconstrained than they think. They may be ready to boldly seek out new solutions like those that worked before.

Michigan Democrats introduced their first pieces of legislation to respond to what they consider overly aggressive Republican proposals to improve election security.
As proposed, the package of bills under the Michigan Election Security Act won’t close the voter registration loopholes that may have allowed at least one noncitizen to cast a ballot that counted last year. And the bills omit the measures Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson suggested in February as a way to prevent noncitizens from casting ballots in Michigan’s elections.
In fact, the initial bills do little to directly address the threat of noncitizen voting, which Republicans have made a top priority since taking control of the House in January.
So what would these new bills do? And what comes next?
 What is in the Michigan Election Security Act?

The Michigan Election Security Act, or MESA, is made up of three bills. They are the first of several in what will be a larger package of election proposals known as the Security, Accountability, and Nonintervention in Elections plan, or SANE, said Rep. Stephen Wooden, a Democrat from Grand Rapids.
“This first phase, in many ways, were the low-hanging fruit — things that have been discussed in the past, that didn’t make it through lame duck last session, that for one reason or another didn’t gain legs in previous terms but are worth revisiting,” Wooden told Votebeat on Tuesday.
The later phases will include bills more focused on noncitizen voting, he said, although what is in those bills will depend on the findings of Attorney General Dana Nessel’s investigation into 15 additional noncitizens who may have voted in 2024. (A spokesperson for Nessel confirmed that the investigations are ongoing but didn’t comment further Tuesday.)
The three MESA bills were written by the three Democrats on the House Election Integrity Committee, with additional sponsors including Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou, a Democrat from East Lansing who chaired the House Election Committee last session, when Democrats controlled the House, and more than 20 other Democrats.
The first, HB 4461 from Wooden, is the one that most directly addresses the threat of noncitizens registering and voting in Michigan.
Wooden’s bill would create new obligations for the secretary of state to help keep the voter rolls free of noncitizens. It would require the secretary to verify the citizenship of any registered voter who “during a transaction with the secretary of state” provides documentation suggesting they aren’t a citizen. The state would have to check the person against state vehicle databases or “any other relevant program.” If that person is found not to be a citizen, the secretary of state would have to notify that person that their voter registration will be canceled within 60 days unless they provide proof of citizenship.
The second bill, HB 4462, comes from Rep. Matt Koleszar of Plymouth. It would allow the secretary of state to remove someone from the voter rolls after they haven’t voted in 20 years. Benson has been working on a similar effort, but it is not a codified requirement.
HB 4463, from Rep. Mai Xiong of Warren, would require the secretary of state to review the instructions on voter registration forms every even-numbered year. The form would have to clearly state that U.S. citizenship is required to register.
Noncitizen voting has become a key target of legislative efforts in recent years, but it remains very rare. In Michigan, there are only 16 known cases of suspected noncitizens casting ballots during the 2024 general election, a tiny fraction of the more than 5.7 million votes cast across the state. The rate matches closely what audits in other states, including Ohio and Georgia, have found.
Republicans have argued that any incidence of noncitizen voting demands a response. In Michigan, they proposed House Joint Resolution B, a constitutional amendment that would require all newly registering voters to show documents proving their citizenship, and require those already registered to confirm their citizenship if the state can’t independently verify it.
Conservatives have hailed it as a commonsense approach to ensure that only citizens vote in U.S. elections, but Democrats and voting rights groups have warned that such a requirement could disenfranchise thousands of eligible voters, including those who don’t have easy access to citizenship documents.
HJR B failed to gain the two-thirds majority required for it to move out of the House last week, but it could come up for a vote again. Meanwhile, a group known as the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights is pushing to get a nearly identical measure on the ballot next year through a petition drive.
 The bills’ prospects in a divided Legislature

Wooden said future proposals from Democrats will aim to address the problem “at the root, rather than the large chainsaw approach like HJR B.”
But passing Democratic-led election bills in a Republican-controlled House won’t be easy. Wooden said he would welcome bipartisan support, but the MESA bills don’t have it yet.
He said he has “nothing but a cordial relationship” with Rep. Rachelle Smit, the Republican from Martin who leads the House Election Integrity Committee and oversees all elections-related bills. But even Tuesday morning, the two sparred during a committee hearing over how elections work in Michigan.
Smit’s office did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Benson, whose office helped shape the bills, lauded the proposals in a news release as “important provisions that will strengthen our ability to keep our voter rolls up to date, help election officials more effectively identify and remove ineligible voter registrations, and provide additional tools to make sure eligible voters can easily register and cast their ballot.”
But Republicans don’t seem as confident that the bills will do enough to address concerns about election security. Rep. Bryan Posthumus, a Republican from Rockford and the main sponsor of HJR B, said he was glad Democrats were taking election security seriously but that he didn’t think the proposed bills went far enough.
He said Michigan needed “guardrails” to prevent noncitizens from being able to cast a ballot. He said he would be willing to work with Democrats on their legislative package.
“There are a million things that we can do to further secure our elections in a positive manner that doesn’t make it more difficult to vote,” he said. “I’m happy to have those conversations with whoever wants to have them, but that doesn’t change the fact that we need to require only U.S. citizens vote in our election with photo ID when casting a ballot.”

Are their minds so weak that mere exposure to certain books will infect them with what Elon Musk calls “the woke mind virus”?
They don’t want you inoculated against measles, but they’re doing their damnedest to inoculate Americans against knowledge.
Novels upset them; poetry upsets them; science upsets them; history upsets them; art upsets them; questioning of authority upsets them.
Universities really, really upset them — all that interrogating norms; all that challenging orthodoxy; all that critical inquiry.
To that end, Donald Trump’s going to war with Harvard, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, even Penn, his alma mater.
Ron DeSantis beat him to it: The governor’s been trying for years to regulate speech, impose restrictions on what teachers can teach, and decree which books the state of Florida finds “acceptable.”
While he’s had some success in K-12, enabling Moms for Liberty and their ilk in their book-banning crusade and threatening educators with dire consequences if they mention the existence of gay and trans people, some judges, unsurprisingly partial to the First Amendment, have slapped him down.
DeSantis, nothing if not energetic in his rage, is now determined to shield our precious college students from Dangerous Thoughts.
Choose the administrators. Choose the presidents. Control the universities.
The University of Florida needs a new dean of Liberal Arts and Sciences — with 40 majors and more than 10,000 students, it’s the largest college at UF.
They got as far as interviewing four highly qualified candidates: two mathematicians — UF’s own Kevin P. Knudson and Maggy Tomova, dean of UCF’s College of Science; Ryan Schroeder, dean of Georgia Southern’s College of Behavioral and Social Sciences; and Robert Brinkmann, a professor of Geology and dean of Liberal Arts and Science at Northern Illinois University.
‘Radical DEI progressives’
But two weeks ago, the governor blew up the search. Demanded UF stop it.
Seems the finalists, admired scholars and seasoned leaders, are crypto-Marxist, Trump-hating eggheads bent on destroying America.
An anonymous social media account calling itself “Commies on Campus” ran shrieking to Bryan Griffin, DeSantis’ communications director, calling all four “radical DEI progressives.”
The Commies posted slick, selectively edited videos of candidate interviews, slamming Brinkmann for stating the obvious: “We have people in charge of things in our country that don’t have any business being in charge of those things,” and Knudson for being proud that as head of UF’s Honors Program “we were able to increase the number of African American and Hispanic students in the program.”
As if that’s somehow shameful.
Kent Fuchs, UF’s invertebrate of an interim president, sent out a memo pretending “terminating the search” was the only thing to do, what with the university also in the middle of hiring a permanent president.
Fuchs has never said no to DeSantis.
He does as he’s told, facilitating the hiring of our data-challenged surgeon general at UF’s medical school and trying to stop professors from testifying on voting rights.
Academic freedom doesn’t matter; the professors’ expertise might pose a “conflict of interest to the executive branch of the state of Florida.”
As if serving the interests of the executive branch should somehow be the mission of a university.
UF remains a distinguished institution, though slipping in national rankings of public universities. It was No. 5 a couple of years ago but is now No. 7.
Still pretty good, especially given DeSantis’ obsessive attacks on higher education in the state.
But allowing some trifling X account to dictate policy at Florida’s flagship university won’t exactly burnish UF’s reputation.
All-purpose insult
Whoever the “Commies on Campus” may be, they weren’t paying attention in political science class.
They call anything they don’t like “communist:” LGBTQ, feminism, secularism, programs for the poor, addressing the climate crisis, taxing the rich, giving anyone without one of those useful White Man Cards a fair shot in life.
“Communist” is MAGA’s all-purpose insult.
Read a book, kids: While real live commies like the ones in North Korea, Cuba, or China may think religion is the opiate of the masses and rich folks (except the leaders of these countries) shouldn’t exist, they’re not keen on stuff like feminism, they persecute gay people, and they sure as hell don’t favor DEI.
Ask the Uighurs.
Yet DeSantis, a man educated beyond his intelligence, takes what these nameless chuckleheads say at face value.
There are in fact a number of well-regarded Marxist scholars at American universities. Yale, the governor’s alma mater, has a reading group studying Marxism and Cultural Theory.
Nevertheless, DeSantis emerged from the Red Menace of New Haven untainted.
He’s also unimpeded by understanding what universities are supposed to do.
An academic’s job is to research everything from the Roman Republic to astrophysics to Norse sagas to gene structure to the ideology of slavery to economic and political systems, which requires reading across the spectrum from “Das Kapital” to “The Road to Serfdom“ and presenting their data and knowledge to students.
We call this “education.”
It’s embarrassing how MAGAs deem Hungarian (or Putinist) authoritarianism OK, even admirable, while “communist” is the gravest of insults and socialism is a mortal sin.
Perhaps they’re unaware socialism is viewed favorably by around 36% of Americans.
That’s almost the same number who say they strongly support Donald Trump.
Ideas are not viruses
The point is, ideas are not viruses: Mere exposure to communist thought doesn’t turn you into a communist, any more than reading James Baldwin’s “Giovanni’s Room” makes you gay, any more than reading “The Wealth of Nations” ensures you’ll become a rabid capitalist.
But MAGAs don’t do high-level thinking: It makes their heads hurt. They simply react.
Loudly. Ignorantly. Irrationally.
Commies on Campus now has a new project: trying to influence who will become the new president of the University of Florida.
UF has announced a finalist.
 One finalist. Chosen in secret.
He is Dr. Santa Ono, a Canadian American immunologist.
The Commies say he’s some kind of woke monster who, as president of the University of Michigan, created “THE LARGEST #DEI EMPIRE in the country.”
Their evidence? Christopher Rufo, the febrile New College trustee last heard claiming immigrants were eating cats and dogs, calls Ono “left-wing” and points to a 2023 commencement address in which he made the unimpeachable statement, “The climate crisis is the existential challenge of our time.”
Florida gubernatorial candidate and Trump acolyte U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, never losing a chance to ingratiate himself with MAGA voters, demands UF “go back to the drawing board.”
Donalds’ hair is on fire because Ono once said, “Racism is one of America’s original sins.”
Deep breath, people: 1. Both of Ono’s statements are perfectly true; and 2. Rufo, Donalds, and the Commies need to update their intel.
Ono has changed his tune. No longer a champion of diversity, he’s now singing from the DeSantis Hymnal, declaring himself in “total alignment” with the governor’s anti-woke crusade.
“I have the same views as this governor,” Ono said.
Bend the knee
During his three years at Michigan (the shortest tenure of any president in the university’s history), Ono initially won praise for prioritizing sustainability and anti-racist projects. Students say he was personable and accessible.
Then Trump happened, and, like too many university administrators, he bent the knee, shutting UM’s DEI office, cracking down on student protest, and creating, as one faculty member said, “a surveillance state.”
Seems he deployed plainclothes officers police to trail and photograph people on UM’s campus.
No wonder DeSantis likes this guy.
Santa is a real scholar, a proper scientist, with academic and administrative qualifications that could have been a great fit at UF. He’s streets ahead of DeSantis’ last hand-picked president, the empty, in-over-his-head Ben Sasse, whose one discernable talent was spending other people’s money.
In a Trump-free world, Ono might have become the leader who could protect the institution. He might have pushed back against the governor’s determination to reduce Florida’s universities to football factories with libraries curated by the likes of Christopher Rufo and courses insisting on the divine greatness of America.
Alas, Ono has made clear that’s not him, not anymore.
This is what you get when one incurious, anti-intellectual, and perpetually angry man chooses university presidents in secret.
This is what you get when there’s only one finalist.
Yes, the trustees officially make the job offer, but there’s no chance they’d hire someone DeSantis didn’t like.
This is the reality of higher ed in Florida today.
FIU has one finalist for president. No shock that it’s DeSantis’ former lieutenant governor and Interim President Jeannette Nuñez.
In its presidential search, FAU announced three finalists. Maybe this would be a real contest?
Two had Ph.Ds. and solid higher ed experience. One was a Republican political hack.
You can guess who got the gig.
A ‘plant’ at FAMU?
Florida A&M, still in the process of choosing a president, has four finalists.
Promising, right?
There were initially three on the shortlist, all with extensive university experience. Then a fourth candidate, a woman with ties to top Republicans, appeared.
She’s Marva Johnson, a communications company executive, appointed by then-Gov. Rick Scott to the Florida Board of Education and chosen by Ron DeSantis for the Florida Scholars Academy Board of Trustees.
Commies on Campus have not yet weighed in on this one.
FAMU alumni say she’d be a terrible choice, calling her “a plant” and likening her to a Trojan Horse hostile to the university’s mission.
But what the alumni want, and what the university wants, probably won’t matter.
What DeSantis wants matters.
As everyone in the unfree state of Florida knows, all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.

Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba recently introduced the “election integrity task force,” a team of federal prosecutors dedicated to enforcing President Trump’s sweeping and unlawful executive order on elections.
Notably, a federal district court has already temporarily blocked key aspects of the executive order, including a provision intended to require voters to show a passport or other citizenship documentation to register to vote in federal elections.
Other components of the executive order, which are also the subject of ongoing legal challenges, would give Elon Musk’s DOGE and the Department of Homeland Security full access to voter files and sensitive voter list maintenance records from every state; penalize states, like New Jersey, that count valid and timely-cast mail-in ballots received after Election Day; decertify voting machines across the country; and more.  Through this executive order, President Trump seeks to seize control of the country’s election infrastructure, usurping the powers of Congress, the states, and the Election Assistance Commission – an independent, bipartisan federal agency.
Like the executive order, the task force is not aimed at a real problem, and instead is premised on false, nativist, and thoroughly discredited narratives about fraudulent voting.
New Jersey elections are fair and secure, and extensive research shows that voter fraud is exceptionally rare. Instead of committing itself to the critical task of protecting the right to vote, the task force trades on the myth of fraud to stoke fear and prejudice while establishing a pretext for voter suppression.
In addition to purportedly addressing phantom issues like registration fraud, non-citizen voting, and double voting, the task force claims to promote “information sharing” to “remove individuals who are not eligible to vote from State voter lists.” This proposal raises serious privacy concerns and threatens aggressive voter purges, which often rely on outdated and unreliable information and ultimately disenfranchise eligible voters.
State and federal laws and the Constitution place firm limits on who can make the types of election administration changes President Trump’s executive order seeks to enact, as well as when and how. The ACLU-NJ and our partners are ready to enforce these protections and to defend the right to vote against new attacks, including from the Trump Administration and the task force.
We will also keep working to advance policies, like the New Jersey Voter Empowerment Act, that provide essential tools for eradicating discrimination in voting. This bill would restore and modernize the protections of the federal Voting Rights Act, which have been steadily eroded in recent decades.

While state workers and the judge discussed, rapid fire, the fate of her family, she prepared to make her case.
She completed the parenting course the state required, and enrolled in more classes — on topics ranging from healthy relationships to helping kids through divorce — which she thought would show initiative. She gathered character references from professionals who had worked closely with her family for years. She continued seeing a therapist and psychiatrist who helped her recover from postpartum depression.
Staff from the state child welfare agency and juvenile office wanted her to go to a different therapist of their choosing but had not provided her with a referral. 
Now, she was ready to explain the situation to the judge, with a thick folder of documentation to back up her account. She raised her hand. 
But the judge told her the docket was full and the hearing wasn’t the correct type for presenting new evidence, using legal terms that were unfamiliar to Knight. The judge heard only the state’s position — that Knight hadn’t completed her services as required — and sided with what the state workers had proposed, leaving the kids in foster care, before moving on to the next case.
Knight left court deflated and confused. 
It was August 2024, and Knight was without an attorney as she fought to reunite with her children — as she would be for months.
“I can’t tell you how nerve-wracking it is, that you have nobody on your side,” she said.
Missouri’s system for providing legal representation to families ensnared in the foster care system is highly decentralized, relying on county-level funding and operating with little state oversight, a months-long investigation by The Independent found. 
The result: some parents, like Knight, go without representation, while those who do get assigned an attorney often find them too overworked and underpaid to provide meaningful advocacy.
Knight’s three oldest children were taken from her in April 2023 on allegations of physical abuse, emotional abuse and neglect that Missouri’s child welfare agency, called Children’s Division, later found to be unsubstantiated. The following year she gave birth to another child, who was removed on an allegation of sexual abuse, which was also found to be unsubstantiated.
For years, she has worked with children. And in a development Knight finds confounding, last fall she passed an extensive background check run through the Department of Social Services — which oversees Children’s Division — allowing her to work with foster children at a residential care facility. 
“I’m good enough to work with other people’s kids, other foster kids within the court system who are a ward of the state,” she said, “but I’m not allowed to have my own.”
Knight’s case has dragged on, and she fears that the longer her kids remain in state custody, the lower their chances of reunification become. 
“I don’t have anybody on my side,” she said. “I’m literally just left alone to basically fend for myself, which is impossible when it comes to these kinds of cases.” 
The attorney initially appointed by the court to represent Knight withdrew and her subsequent request for a replacement was denied by the court. In September, she picked up a second job to hire an attorney, who she has so far paid over $6,000. She works overtime whenever she can. She’s not sure how much longer she’ll be able to afford to keep paying him, at $375 an hour.

The U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to representation for those facing criminal charges. But there is no such federal right in civil court, where foster care cases unfold. The consequences — family separation — can feel as severe as incarceration.
The outcome can depend on where you live, even within a state. 
In some Missouri counties, more than 80% of foster care cases involving a biological parent list no attorney for the parent, while in other counties, that rate is under 10%. That’s according to data produced by the Office of State Courts Administrator — which provides administrative, business and technology support to Missouri courts — in response to a request from The Independent. 
State law grants judges in Missouri more discretion than in most other states when deciding whether to appoint counsel for indigent parents. Once appointed, quality and pay vary widely. 
A survey of Missouri’s 46 judicial circuits by The Independent shows some counties pay parents’ attorneys as little as $25 per hearing, and some attorneys carry hundreds of cases at a time. Attorneys told The Independent in some counties parent representation is considered pro bono work because the pay is so low. 
There is no required specialized training in the state to be a parents’ attorney, though there is required training for similar positions, such as guardians ad litem — attorneys tasked with representing foster kids’ best interests. There are no state Supreme Court-adopted standards of practice. Parents’ attorneys in most counties in the state are solo practitioners who agree to take on some of these cases in addition to the rest of their caseload. They don’t always have expertise in this complex area of law. 
No counties had, as of last month, spent federal funding that has been available for parent representation since 2019, a spokesperson for the Department of Social Services told The Independent — and just one county is in the process of doing so.
Courts reached by The Independent all said it’s routine to appoint an attorney for indigent parents, when requested. Parents who spoke to The Independent about their struggles navigating the process, and advocates who work with them, said it isn’t always so straightforward. 
Some parents said they didn’t know they could qualify, were rejected even though they were too poor to afford a lawyer out-of-pocket, or received representation only for the initial part of their case. Others said they were appointed attorneys who were impossible to reach outside of court and didn’t seem to be advocating for them.
“Each individual county and circuit gets to do it however they want,” said Claire Terrebonne, who was a parents’ attorney in Kansas City for over a decade, and has pushed for systemic reform in the state. “It was really when I looked outward that I became so shocked about how we do things here.” 
Allison Green, chief legal officer for the National Association of Counsel for Children, which advocates for robust family defense, said access to quality counsel for parents and kids is “absolutely critical” for a healthy and functional child welfare system.
“A common misconception is that foster care is only a social service discipline,” she said, “when actually foster care implicates the civil rights of children and parents and families.”
The system should function, Green said, to make sure that families “are only separated when it’s absolutely necessary to do so, and that they are provided the services that federal and state law requires in order to reunify them.” 
Several states in recent years, including Oklahoma, have moved toward centralized systems of family representation, similar to statewide public defender offices, to ensure consistent, high-quality representation that is uniformly funded. 
This issue has gotten scant attention from the Missouri Legislature, though this year one section of a wide-ranging foster care bill takes steps toward understanding the system, by establishing a commission to study parents’ and children’s legal representation throughout the state, and directing the commission to recommend practice standards and training requirements. That bill passed — close to none of the discussion during hearings dealt with parents’ representation — and awaits Gov. Mike Kehoe’s signature.
Clark Peters, a professor of social work at the University of Missouri-Columbia whose research specializes in foster care, said the stakes of high-quality parent counsel are enormous.
“We sometimes lose sight: a day without your child is tremendously difficult for parents and for children,” he said. “To go months?  I mean, it’s kind of unthinkable…We’re talking about child well-being and family integrity. What is more important than that?” 
 ‘By yourself, it’s impossible’

States vary widely in how they organize their systems of family defense and the rights afforded to accused parents, as there is no federal right to an attorney for parents in child welfare proceedings. Most states have a statutory right to counsel. Missouri is among a few that has a statutory right with discretion, meaning judges can decide on a case-by-case basis. They must determine that appointment is necessary for a “full and fair hearing,” as well as determine that the parent desires counsel and is indigent. 
There’s little consistency in how judges determine whether a parent can afford an attorney on their own, or whether they need one. 
If a case reaches the termination of parental rights stage, state law requires a lawyer be provided, and the state, rather than county, pays for it. But by that point, advocates say, it can be too late: If the parent hasn’t been zealously represented all along, with a lawyer doing things like helping document all the efforts they’ve taken to reunify, and connecting them to resources, they won’t have a strong defense. 
Federal law says that if the child has been in foster care for 15 out of the most recent 22 months, the state generally should file a petition to terminate parental rights. 
Kathleen DuBois, who represented parents for over two decades as an attorney with the legal aid organization in St. Louis, said the threat of termination of parental rights means an attorney should be appointed at the outset and the state should foot the bill.
“To me, the case is a termination from the time that the child is taken,” she said. “So you should treat it as a termination of rights from the very beginning and pay for counsel for the parent from the very beginning without putting all these conditions on it.” 
DuBois remembers a client who had previously been represented by a court-appointed attorney with so many cases that he had no idea who the client even was.
“That’s pretty shameless to tell somebody that you can’t even figure out who they are,” she said. “…But people are acting like this is just an ordinary process, and it’s not. It’s the civil death penalty.”
DuBois said as an attorney, she would help parents connect to necessary services, some of which Children’s Division may not have known about, and explain to her clients the importance of complying. Parents’ attorneys help translate the parents’ efforts to the court and the court’s requirements to parents; they also help explain and protect parents’ rights, and advocate for the placement and visitation wishes of the parent.
A statewide, uniform infrastructure with robust defense, she said, “would certainly get better justice.” 
 Amanda Garretson plays at home with her 3-year-old in Springfield (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).
Amanda Garretson, a mother of two daughters in Springfield who has grappled with addiction, homelessness and mental illness, experienced the difference having an attorney can make. 
Her older daughter was taken into state custody in late 2019, after Garretson attempted suicide.
“I wasn’t harming my child. I was there because I was depressed,” she said. 
She assumed because she couldn’t afford an attorney, she wouldn’t get one, and doesn’t remember ever being told otherwise. Garretson missed the first court hearing, but at meetings thereafter, she doesn’t remember anyone on her support team, including caseworkers, ever telling her she would qualify or what the role of a lawyer would be in these complex arrangements. She felt overwhelmed by all the new phrases — from family support team meeting, to jurisdictional hearing and shelter hearing — and “scared to death” with no one to explain them.
She said she felt the state workers were treating her as “guilty until proven innocent.”
She knew she needed counseling and that with the right support she could recover. Instead, she said the process of trying to get her daughter back, and a sense no one was fighting for her, caused her to “fall hard into addiction” and become homeless.
In 2021, her daughter was adopted and Garretson’s parental rights were involuntarily terminated. Garretson still hopes one day to reunite with her.
“I didn’t have anyone on my side, and I just, I didn’t know what was going on,” she said. “I didn’t know the procedures. They’re like, ‘Well, you should have researched it.’ When you’re that far into a trauma mode, you’re grieving your child like they’re dead.” 
“I know 100% that it would have been a whole lot different if I had any ounce of support on my side,” she said.
She contrasts that experience with the case of her younger daughter, who was born in 2021. Her daughter was taken into Children’s Division custody for over a year on allegations of drug use that Garretson denied, after they were in a car accident.
That time, Garretson was given a court-appointed attorney who helped explain what was happening, and she said fought hard for her. Still, as the case stretched on, she decided to pay $2,500 she scraped together for a private lawyer. She thought the judge would take her more seriously and close the case more quickly, and she worried if the Children’s Division case stayed open, it would affect a separate, family court case.
Her Children’s Division case was finally closed earlier this year and she has her younger daughter back.
“By yourself,” she said, “it’s impossible.” 
Families in poverty are more likely to have their kids taken into foster care; they’re also least likely to be able to afford to pay high-quality attorneys out-of-pocket.
“What happens if your children were with strangers for months? And what would you do? Of course, you would hire an attorney,” said Peters, the University of Missouri professor. “And the fact is that poor litigants, residents of Missouri who can’t afford it, they should get those. Not just a warm body, but somebody who’s going to fight to make sure that their child and that family gets to the other side of this legal matter in the best shape they can.”
 A high rate of removal, lingering in the foster care system

Missouri has long taken kids into foster care at a rate higher than average and kept them there for more time. 
There were 11,085 kids in foster care as of March, down from a peak of 14,265 kids in 2021. The entry rate is still higher than the national average.
Only 44% of Missouri foster children were reunited with their families within a year of entering state care, according to the most recent data in the agency’s budget, covering fiscal year 2024. 
The federal benchmark is 75%.
Baylee Watts, spokesperson for the Department of Social Services, wrote by email that the agency “is committed, and all team members are expected, to actively support reunification efforts when safe and appropriate, in alignment with both statutory mandates and best practices in child welfare.”
Studies show high-quality representation for families improves the speed of kids going home with no evidence of an increased rate of maltreatment or reentry into foster care. There are also potential cost savings.
Advocates say robust legal representation could allow the state Children’s Division to devote its limited resources to the most severe cases.
Richard Wexler, director of the advocacy group National Coalition for Child Welfare Reform, said there is a “deep contempt for families” in the system by those who assume horror stories about child abuse are the norm, which is “nothing like what most of these families are like.”
Over half of substantiated cases in Missouri involve neglect, a category often conflated with conditions of poverty, including housing instability and lack of supervision due to an absence of child care.
“The fact that some families are literally defenseless is a travesty. They are facing consequences vastly more serious than many criminal offenses when they have a constitutional right to a lawyer,” Wexler said.
 System for lawyers varies by county

Daniel Kuehnel, a father in Arnold whose two kids were taken into foster care in 2022, said he had no idea he could have qualified for a free lawyer. He was accused of physical abuse and emotional abuse, which he denied, amid a contentious divorce and custody battle. Earlier this year, Children’s Division closed the case and he has full custody of his son. He sees his daughter, who lives with a relative, each weekend.
He didn’t attend the first court date — an emergency placement hearing — because he was “freaking out all night,” terrified, he said, after finding out the state had removed his kids the afternoon prior. He had left the house to pick up his son from his bus and run into two police officers and two investigators, he said, and found it impossible to prepare for court less than 24 hours later.
He would likely have qualified for a court-appointed lawyer as indigent because he was receiving food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. He was working in maintenance at the time and is now living on veterans’ disability payments.
“I didn’t know a lot of this stuff,” he said. “Nobody informed me of nothing.”
For the first month, he didn’t have an attorney and felt “hopeless.” 
His now-spouse, whom he met a few months after the case opened, was willing to lend him money to pay for an attorney, which Kuehnel said made all the difference in his case. 
He ultimately paid around $40,000 to three attorneys, trying to keep his family together.

His final attorney really fought for him, he said. The state closed his case earlier this year.
“In the system, it’s about money,” he said, “and if you got the money, that case is going to get handled.” 
In Jefferson County, where Kuehnel lives, there was no attorney listed for parents in 46% of foster care cases from 2020 to 2024, according to data the Office of State Courts Administrator produced in response to a records request from The Independent. 
Jefferson County’s juvenile office didn’t respond to several requests for comment. But court officials in other counties told The Independent there could be a variety of reasons for parents not having an attorney listed, ranging from the parent not wanting one because they don’t trust the system to a parent not engaging in the process at all. 
The issue of parents lacking counsel appears to be a problem throughout the state to varying degrees. In Christian and Greene counties, where Knight and Garretson live, state court data shows just single-digit rates of parents going without attorneys. The chief juvenile officer for Greene County, Bill Prince, said the court “makes every effort” to provide eligible parents with attorneys, including by offering the application for counsel as soon as the court makes contact with the parent, and inquiring about the issue at each hearing in which the parent appears without counsel.
The presiding judge of Christian County, Laura Johnson, wrote in an email to The Independent that it’s “highly unusual” for parents to proceed without an attorney. She said generally speaking that it’s unusual for a court-appointed attorney to withdraw and when it happens, it’s most often because the parent chose to end that relationship.
“If a parent chooses to ‘fire’ a court-appointed attorney, the court usually does not appoint another attorney for that parent,” Johnson wrote, but if the attorney withdraws for a reason “not within the parent’s control…then another attorney will be appointed.”
Knight, the mother who is trying to reunite with her children in Christian County, insisted she didn’t fire her attorney, though she said their relationship was strained because the two disagreed over whether Knight should have her providers and advocates come to the monthly case management meetings. Court records show the attorney filed a motion to withdraw from Knight’s case in July 2024, citing an “irreparable breakdown” of the attorney-client relationship.
 ‘No matter how hard I try’ 

 Megan Knight, wearing a sweatshirt that says “mama,” in Springfield earlier this year (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).
Knight said as the state continues to keep her kids in care, it’s the kids who suffer the consequences. She wishes earlier in her case, she could have conveyed to the judge all she’d wanted to — if she’d had a zealous court-appointed advocate.
Her four-year-old daughter has been moved seven times since she was taken into foster care in April 2022. Knight said she’s developed behavioral issues Knight attributes to the trauma of separation and being tossed around from home to home.
“When I was able to see her, she would always beg the caseworker, ‘Please, let me go home to my mom,’” she said.
Now, her daughter is in care with a foster family and Knight doesn’t know where in Missouri they are or who the family is. Two of her kids are in another stranger’s home. 
She’s losing sleep over her absent children and her hair is falling out. 
Johnson, the Christian County presiding judge, wrote in an email that she cannot comment on pending cases. But the reason cases would remain open, generally, after Children’s Division finds child abuse or neglect allegations to be unsubstantiated, is because the juvenile courts have an “independent statutory duty” to find a safe, nurturing and permanent placement for a child removed from their home, which requires hearings and sometimes treatment plans, she said. The juvenile court cannot return the child to their home until all statutory requirements are met, Johnson said.
The Department of Social Services can’t comment on specific cases, said Watts, the agency’s spokesperson. She said that although an investigation may conclude as unsubstantiated, “and a person deemed eligible for employment, that does not resolve or override the juvenile court proceeding, the outcome of which is ultimately determined by the juvenile court judge.” She added that sometimes additional concerns come to light after the investigation of the initial allegations, so the absence of substantiated findings “may not alleviate all of the concerns present in the foster care case.”
Knight requested a copy of her case file from the Department of Social Services last July, and still has not received it — which the agency in a message to Knight attributed to a backlog of requests.
Knight says the state continues portraying her as mentally unstable, though therapy notes and records from private social services groups Knight has worked with — the notes she wanted to convey to the judge that day last summer — provide a different picture. 
 Knight’s children play together in 2022, the year before they were taken into foster care (photo submitted).
Her therapist last year wrote that Knight “has immense love for her kids and this is the reason she has fought this hard in this case.” Knight’s behavior leading up to when her kids were taken — which involved yelling at her baby and telling her parents she wanted to die —  was consistent with postpartum depression, she wrote.
The therapist said she was worried about “long-term trauma…for not only Megan but her children.” She recommended that reunification be the goal “due to mental health concerns being a primary cause of children’s removal, and current mental health of the client being observed as stable and appropriate for life circumstances.” 
A parent advocate from a nonprofit last year wrote to the court that despite “all of Megan’s efforts and her willingness to be transparent with the team, seek any services requested and show growth in setting healthy boundaries in her relationships,” her efforts to get her kids back continued to stall, and the state workers seemed intent on pursuing termination of her rights.
The Office of Child Advocate, the independent oversight arm for the Children’s Division, investigated Knight’s case and found “policy and procedure concerns” it conveyed to Children’s Division including the state workers’ “derogatory” comments about the family, according to a findings’ letter sent to Knight in January 2024.
“It would be best practice for all team members to be supportive of reunification,” the agency, which investigates complaints against the child welfare system, wrote. The agency added that it was “unclear what services or accommodations were being provided” to Knight to help with her documented mental health diagnoses including depression and anxiety.
A social worker through a nonprofit wrote in a report to the court last year that Knight will “continue to parent effectively, with ongoing mental health support following case closure.” 
Knight said those sources have been discounted in her case, even after her current lawyer was finally allowed to introduce them. She worries the case is too far gone.
While she attended therapy throughout most of the process, the state is requiring her to work with a therapist of their choosing. Knight has waited nine months to be assigned a state-approved therapist, and her caseworker told her in a text last month that they are still looking.
Watts, the spokesperson, said the Department of Social Services “acknowledges that in some areas, finding service providers who accept state-approved rates can be difficult, potentially delaying reunification efforts even when a parent is compliant and motivated,” and that Children’s Division “strives to find appropriate services for parents” including by looking beyond the local area or using remote services.
In February, Knight found out she is pregnant. When she told her caseworker, she said she was told the baby would likely be removed, too, due to her open case. 
“I’m just lost beyond words, really. It’s like, no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, no matter how honest I am, it just gets thrown in my face,” Knight said. 
“Never in my life did I think I would be in this situation.”

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”










As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services


But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”
Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

[…],"Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O'Laughlin, a Republican Shelbina, talks with reporters May 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Will the Missouri Senate actually make it to 6 p.m. Friday? 
That’s the constitutional deadline for the legislative session to adjourn for the year. And the Senate — thanks to Republican infighting — has failed to reach the finish line three years in a row. 
But this year the GOP supermajority is finally getting along. And as lawmakers enter the final week of the 2025 legislative session, Senate Republicans hope that unity will allow them to roll back abortion rights and a new paid sick leave law over the vehement resistance of Democrats. 
Whether or not the session goes off the rails again this year — and kills a litany of largely bipartisan bills in the process — will largely be determined by whether Republicans and Democrats can strike a deal on two issues that touch on key ideological differences. .
“My philosophy has always been, if you just sit down together, you can figure it out,” said Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican. “So that’s what I’m doing. I have a really good relationship with the Democrats, and everyone is negotiating in good faith.”
If those negotiations fall apart, the GOP could turn to the nuclear option. 
Republicans hold 24 seats in the 34-member Senate. It takes only a simple majority of 18 votes to end a filibuster using a procedural maneuver known as “calling the previous question,” or PQ. 
But Senate leaders have historically been hesitant to utilize the PQ because it generates lasting bitterness — and sparks retaliation. If past is prologue, Democrats would respond by turning to procedural maneuvers of their own to grind the chamber to a halt and make any progress all but impossible.  
That scenario would also kill any bills still pending in the Senate with the bad blood and gridlock generated possibly spilling into the next legislative session. 
That’s why since 1970, the Senate has only used PQ 18 times. The last time was in 2020. 
“The last thing either side wants is a PQ,” said Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat. 
In November, both issues at the heart of the Senate’s final week won approval on the statewide ballot. 
Proposition A, which won 58% of the vote, mandated employers with business receipts greater than $500,000 a year to provide at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours.
That law went into effect May 1. 
Amendment 3, which won with 52% of the vote, legalized abortion up until the point of fetal viability — generally seen as the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb on its own, or around 24 weeks. It also protects access to other reproductive health care, like birth control.
Since it passed, a judge blocked a litany of Missouri abortion regulations, opening the door for access to the procedure for the first time in years. 
Senate negotiations on both issues have persisted for weeks. And despite some public discord, both sides enter the waning days before adjournment confident a deal can be reached. 
“I know that there’s a lot of ideology going around and lots of things being thrown at each other, but actually the vast majority of people are somewhere in the middle,” O’Laughlin said. “And if you listen to everyone in their perspective, you can figure it out.”
 Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson discusses the final weeks of the 2025 legislative session (Rudi Keller/Missouri House).
While the possibility of a PQ is the biggest minefield lawmakers are trying to navigate in the final week, disharmony between the House and Senate could also prove explosive. 
On Friday, lawmakers completed work on the state’s $53 billion budget. But in a stunning move, the House refused to allow a vote on a $530 million construction package approved by the Senate earlier in the day. 
Senate leaders were not told of the House’s decision in advance, and the move sparked outrage and accusations of betrayal. 
“The phone calls I’ve been receiving from my Senate counterparts do not lead me to believe that next week is going to be productive if you have a House bill in the Senate,” Senate Appropriations Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican, told the Kansas City Star soon after the House vote on Friday.  
House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, downplayed the possibility of the move causing friction between the two chambers in the final week, telling reporters that he doesn’t expect the Senate to upend a session that has been marked by GOP unity. 
“I have nothing but great things to say about how the Senate has been working this year,” he said. “I think they’ll continue to work like that.”
His Democratic colleagues aren’t convinced Patterson’s prediction will prove accurate. 
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said she would not be surprised to see “an even greater battle emerge between the chambers in the last few days of session over this particular situation.”
Another possible stumbling block: with only five days left before adjournment, the governor’s office and House leaders are pondering a push to provide $300 million in state funding to help build a new baseball stadium in Clay County. 
The aim is to keep the Kansas City Royals from moving across the state line, where Kansas lawmakers created an incentive packaging to convince the team to leave Missouri when the lease on its current stadium expires in 2030. 
But the plan has never been presented as a formal bill and never had a public hearing or debate — a reality that could cause real problems in the Senate, where any resistance could prove fatal.  
State Sen. Joe Nicola, an Independence Republican whose district includes the Royal’s current stadium in Jackson County, said he would have serious concerns about any plan that would move the team to another county. 
But Nicola hasn’t been consulted on the stadium funding plan percolating in the House, so he didn’t want to comment until he had a chance to study it closely.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/051724_olaughlin1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-12 07:05:10.087379

Stand up, fight back"" (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Debate about abortion is often divorced from reality. But I was still stunned by the stream of elaborate and hurtful lies from Missouri lawmakers at the recent hearing on the bill to overturn Amendment 3.
House Joint Resolution 73 is an attempt to reinstate the abortion ban that Missouri voters rejected when we passed Amendment 3.
The bill itself, which would put the legality of abortion back on the ballot, is written to be as misleading as possible. For example, it contains a ballot summary that doesn’t tell voters that it would put the ban back in effect. It instead asks voters if they want to protect treatment for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies.
But the hearing was amazing for the way Republican legislators openly infantilized and lied about Missouri voters, women and doctors.
The bill sponsor, Republican state Rep. Brian Seitz of Branson, opened with testimony tightly packed with falsehoods and paternalism: “The preeminent facet of this legislation is that it protects women. What Amendment 3 took away from them, this legislation seeks to restore.”
The implication is that I, like all women, need to be protected from my choices about my family, life and health care. I also need to be protected from the vote that I cast in November to take away the state’s authority to make those decisions for me. This is because I, like the majority of Missouri voters, lack the intelligence to have understood what I was voting for on a widely and fiercely debated issue.
This theme of “protecting” women is also about justifying medically inappropriate abortion regulations. These regulations are sold as health protections but are actually intended to be impossible to comply with, so that abortion clinics can’t operate. These are “targeted regulation of abortion providers,” or “TRAP” laws.
Amendment 3 forecloses that backdoor ban strategy by putting the burden on the state to prove that a regulation actually has a health benefit. Amendment 3 also bars discrimination against abortion care. It’s easy to tell when a law discriminates against abortion care by looking at whether the same regulations apply to miscarriage care, because abortion involves the same procedures and medications.
Seitz went on to make the particularly fanciful claim that “this legislation seeks to align itself with the will of the voter” because “the people expressed that they wanted exceptions.”
We did not express that we wanted exceptions. Amendment 3 had nothing to do with and no mention of exceptions. 
What voters said is that we don’t want abortion to be banned in Missouri anymore. 
The claim that what voters really wanted was for abortion to continue to be banned but with exceptions for those victims of rape and incest who can jump through all the hoops our anti-exceptions legislature has in store for them is a fantastical lie. 
“Incest” refers to a child raped and impregnanted by a family member. 
Even House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit (who is a doctor and was the lone Republican to vote against the bill) acknowledged that a child who is being sexually abused is not likely to realize she is pregnant by the 12 week cut off for the victim exception in HJR 73. And if this child does realize what is happening to her before 12 weeks, how is she supposed to end her pregnancy if there are no functioning abortion clinics in this state?
The hearing devolved into legislators interrogating testifying pastors about when life begins and berating doctors who testified that their patients were harmed under the ban.
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville, responded vehemently to a doctor recounting how the ban had caused harm to her miscarrying patients, including one who bled for four weeks after being denied a procedure to evacuate her uterus. 
Brattin, like lawmakers across the country, blamed doctors for not understanding the law.
“Negligence of the law is no excuse” he said repeatedly. I’m pretty sure what he meant to say is “ignorance of the law is no excuse,” which he illustrated with the classic example that not knowing the speed limit is not an excuse for speeding.
But I think Brattin hit on an accidental insight with “negligence of the law is no excuse.” 
Lawmakers need to own the outcomes of the laws they pass.
Doctors provide care based on what their lawyers say they can or cannot do. As ProPublica has documented in Texas, many hospital lawyers are telling doctors they can’t provide miscarriage care until the patient shows signs of infection or other life threatening complications when fetal heart tones can still be detected. 
Others are providing no guidance or legal support at all, leaving doctors to navigate the risk of criminal prosecution unaided. ProPublica has reported on the deaths of five women denied abortion care. Another 20 women who survived have sued Texas.
Missouri’s medical emergency “exception” language in both the now enjoined ban and HJR 73 is nearly identical to Texas’ — but worse. 
It required not just that a patient be at “a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function,” but that the impairment be “substantial and irreversible.” And the exception wasn’t actually an exception. It was a defense to the crime of providing any abortion that the doctor would have the burden of proving at trial. 
Missouri has fewer reported stories than Texas of women injured because we are a small state that borders states where abortion is legal. But we know it happened here, too. 
When Mylissa Farmer was miscarrying she was sent to a Kansas hospital three hours away for treatment. She was turned away in Kansas where abortion is legal but heavily restricted. When she was finally able to get an abortion in Illinois, she was in excruciating pain and had an infection. 
The rate of sepsis among pregnant women, which can be fatal, has increased by 50% since Texas banned abortion. There’s no reason to think women here weren’t similarly endangered when Missouri’s ban was in effect.
And yet, Brattin yelled that the ban’s emergency exception had been perfectly clear. It wasn’t the law but doctors’ ignorance of it that caused women who had lost their babies to bleed for weeks. 
Let’s accept, for the sake of argument, that lawmakers didn’t intend to imperil pregnant women. Intent doesn’t matter. As Brattin put it: “negligence of the law is no excuse.” 
And at this point, it’s not negligence but deliberate indifference, given that injuries have been widely reported and a doctor told Brattin to his face that she had treated patients who were denied miscarriage care. The harm is known, but he and his fellow Republicans do not care. 
Miscarrying women are justifiable collateral damage in their attack on the main target: women and girls who do not want to continue their pregnancies. They want the opposite of safer abortion. They want to reinstate the ban so that we have to have later, more complicated or invasive procedures after traveling out of state, or to self manage with abortion medication from the internet without local medical supervision. 
They want anyone who needs an abortion to suffer as much as possible.
It’s not protection, it’s punishment.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041525_protest3-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-05-12 07:05:10.087379

For the more than 850,000 Indiana children who are infants through 9 years old, only 763 licensed child care centers exist to take care of them when their parents cannot. Because of this, a CNBC study ranked Indiana almost at the bottom for quality of life, with the worst access to child care in the country.
At the beginning of the 2025 legislative session, Indiana Senate Democrats prioritized child care in their agenda, writing that they hoped to fully fund the Child Care Development Fund (CCDF), a child care subsidy for low-income families. But with the session ending April 24, their goal did not come to fruition in the supermajority Republican General Assembly.
  Vanessa Green Sinders, president and CEO of the Indiana Chamber.
A 2024 study by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce found that over half of Hoosier parents miss work or class because they cannot find child care. Absenteeism and employee turnover caused by this struggle creates an estimated $3.05 billion in losses for Hoosier employers each year.
Vanessa Green Sinders, president and CEO of the Indiana Chamber, told TheStatehouseFile.com in January that child care desserts like Indiana deter potential workers from coming to the state.
“We are such a great state to do business in, and we have so much economic development going on, … but that enthusiasm and that economic development is going to take more workforce,” Sinders said.
The Indiana General Assembly did not allot funding in the state budget to give Hoosiers universal, affordable child care through the CCDF, On My Way Pre-K or any other program. Instead, lawmakers wrote piecemeal legislation that addressed small parts of the larger problem.
 Legislation 
— House Bill 1253 was signed into law by Gov. Mike Braun on May 1.
During a House meeting late in the legislative session, which ended April 24, bill author Rep. Dave Heine, R-Fort Wayne, said the Senate amended the bill to no longer require children who receive child care at a school to be a child of an employee. The Senate also changed the bill to allow multi-site child care centers, like a YMCA, to be able to operate under one license.
“It really will make it easier for them to expand but also, importantly, maintain the ability of the state to, you know, inspect and hold accountable those individual sites without jeopardizing the functioning of the entire enterprise,” Sam Snideman, vice president of government relations for United Way of Central Indiana, told TheStatehouseFile.com.

The most important Senate amendment, in Heine’s opinion, was the addition of language that allows in-home child care centers to continue operation as class two structures as long as they are licensed in that category before July 1.
“This is very important language that was added because right now, we have 43  child care facilities providing child care to approximately 800 children that could be at risk of closing down if we did not add this language,” Heine said in the House meeting.
— Senate Bill 463, also signed by Braun May 1, would give a tax credit to employers who offer near or onsite child care to their employees.
Snideman said adding this option would make employers who opt into the tax credit more competitive in Indiana’s job market because employees with kids might choose to work there for child care.
The new law will also expand the Micro-Facility Pilot Program, a project that allows existing child care centers to open small, non-residential ones that serve three to 30 children.
Sinders said the Indiana Chamber supported SB 463 and HB 1253 because they attempt to make child care more affordable and accessible in Indiana.
— House Bill 1248, signed into law April 10, sets aside CCDF funds for foster families who receive last-minute placements.
“We don’t want to disadvantage those folks who are doing, you know, really important work or, you know, quite honestly disrupt the care for kids who are already facing tremendous challenges.” Snideman said.
— House Bill 1102, another child care bill that reached the governor’s desk, receiving his signature April 3, will allow schools to enter contracts with religiously affiliated, nonprofit pre-K sites that offer child care. Snideman said this will create more potential providers for Hoosier families.
Snideman believes the reason Indiana has not invested fully in CDDF and other government-funded child care initiatives is because the issue is so broad. But both he and Sinders believe there’s room for optimism.
“I think about it from a positive perspective,” Sinders said. “The legislature is willing to continue to work on this issue and continue to try to make progress. … Every bite at the apple helps get you to the solution.”
Snideman is even more confident about the possibility of universal child care in Indiana’s future.
“We are committed to expanding opportunities for Hoosiers in this space,” he said, “which means we will be committed to this long, incremental process of us getting to a place where eventually, you know, every family in our state who wants and needs to send their kids to pre-K or to child care will have that opportunity.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Malyka Myada represents one of the 45,000 Maryland state child care scholarship recipients who not only pay for a protected space for their children, but also education programs and before- or after-school care.
Thanks to the scholarship, Myada pays about $540 a month for her two children, ages 3 and 1. Without it, she said Friday, it would be at least $2,000. Because her two children are already in the scholarship program at Greenway Learning Center in Greenbelt, Myada’s third child, who’s a month old, will also be able to receive full-time child care at eight weeks.
“The scholarship helps, but it’s like paying rent,” said Myada, a 24-year-old single mother of Greenelt. “My children have a safe space. It’s a nice place.”
But for the moment, access to that safe space has been put on hold by the state.
Faced with a sharp rise in children in the program — and costs for it — the state imposed a freeze on new enrollments May 1. New parents can still apply for a child care scholarship, but will be placed on a waiting list until enrollment declines. Officials hope to lift the freeze by September, when the number of recipients is expected to decrease to 40,000.
Child care providers and early childhood advocates such as Patti Smith hope that happens. It not, centers such as the one in Greenbelt could have empty seats as children leave to enroll in prekindergarten or kindergarten in the public schools.

“We hope that the freeze is melted through the summer,” said Smith, director of the center in Greenbelt, where 20 of the 44 infants, toddlers and preschoolers are on scholarship. “Education starts when children are infants. When they crawl, they work their muscles. That is all helping with fine motor skills.”
State officials also saw the importance of early childhood education, expanding income eligibility to allow more families to qualify for the scholarships. For instance, a family of four can earn up to $112,000 per year and qualify for assistance.
Sarah Neville-Morgan, assistant state superintendent in the state Department of Education’s Division of Early Childhood, said in an interview Thursday that scholarships have jumped from 21,000 in 2023 to more than 45,000 today.
Because of its popularity and growth, officials worried the program could exceed its $270 million budget this fiscal year. But Neville-Morgan notes that, even in a tight budget year and an uncertain future under the Trump administration, the state added another $100 million to the program budget next year
“That needs to be celebrated. It shows how Maryland is investing in its children,” Neville-Morgan, who began her position in the department last month, said about the growth of the program.
“You’ve seen a current, proposed budget from the federal level that doesn’t fully support children and families,” she said. “We are lucky enough to live in a state that does prioritize children and families.”
She continued: “We’ll have to continue to look at what are those resources, and where are we getting them, and then how do we prioritize as we move forward.”
Even though current parents and providers will continue to receive funding, incorporating an enrollment freeze still doesn’t sit well with longtime early childhood educator Evelyn Owens.
“I think it’s terrible,” said Owens, a mentor teacher at Downtown Baltimore Child Care, who’s worked there for four decades. “What about those parents who could use that scholarship now? Early childhood education is necessary.”

Early learning
On Thursday, Owens and another teacher, Keonna Akoma, worked with a prekindergarten class of about 15 students.
Akoma sat on the carpet with Anthony Johnson, 5, to help connect magnetic tiles that resembled a large box. When Akoma was about to place a red tile on top, Johnson tucked underneath and curled up.
Four students in blue aprons were dipping cups, bowls and other utensils inside a large sink with water and suds.
Three girls played upstairs in a play area that included a poster of fruits and vegetables, dolls, a highchair, a bench with a doughnut pillow and other toys.
Zane Romero and Kai Down, both age 5, used real hammers to bang on real nails in the wood working area.
When all the children were asked to come to the carpet and sing a song, Emmeline Calahan Montanez, 5, tugged on Owens’ shirt.
“I never got a turn,” Emmeline said to Owens.
“Let me correct you on that. You did a get turn,” Owens said.
“Oh yeah, I forgot,” Emmeline said with a smile and walked to the carpet.
Nikeiha Wallace, director of the center, said the prekindergartners who began in August represent the first pre-K class at the center.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The expansion of prekindergarten services in public schools and child care providers is part of the “mixed-delivery system” in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
A total of 67 children are at the center, two of whom receive a child care scholarship.
According to the center’s website, monthly tuition ranges from nearly $2,400 full-time for a parent with a child at 12 weeks, to $1,800 for children 37 months and older.
“That $1,800 a month is one of the lowest ones [tuition], so with that scholarship it helps parents receive high-quality education,” Wallace said.
Myada from Greenbelt wants to go back to school and get a cosmetology license. In the meantime, and with three children, she’s looking for at least part-time work to fit her schedule. To earn some money, she will do delivery service for Door Dash and Stub Hub.
“I want to build a career and become more stable for my kids,” she said. “Having that scholarship will help me build toward that.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hammer-and-nails-5-8-2025-1024x722.jpg,,,2025-05-12 07:05:10.087379

A report from the Midwest Economic Policy Institute says Wisconsin's apprenticeship programs could grow faster with some changes in state laws. (Photo courtesy of the Wisconsin Laborers' District Council)Wisconsin saw the number of construction apprentices grow in the last decade, but a new report suggests that growth might have been stronger with some changes in Wisconsin law.
One change would be to restore the state’s prevailing wage law on government construction projects. The other would be to repeal Wisconsin’s “right-to-work” law — a measure that prevents unions from requiring all workers that they represent to pay union dues.
The report was produced by the Midwest Economic Policy Institute, based in  La Grange, Illinois, and conducted jointly with the Project for Middle Class Renewal at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
“While increased public investment in the construction sector is having a positive impact on the apprenticeship system, it is clear that state policy interventions that erode workforce institutions that prioritize training have had the opposite effect,” U of I professor Robert Bruno, director of the Project for Middle Class Renewal, said in a statement.
Bruno said that in addition to reinstituting Wisconsin’ prevailing wage law and repealing the right-to-work law, states can increase their investment in pre-apprenticeship programs to boost the foundational skills for skilled trades workers. He also has suggested tax credits to give more employers an incentive “to invest in our long-term domestic labor supply.”
Looking at data from 2022, the study’s authors found that unionized construction companies account for 22% of the construction market in Wisconsin. Despite that, apprenticeship programs operated jointly by employers and unions enroll 77% of construction apprentices and account for 96% of the money spent in Wisconsin on apprenticeship programs.  
When it comes to training, “the unionized segment of the construction industry punches above its weight by a great deal,” MEPI economist Frank Manzo IV told the Wisconsin Examiner.
Funding advantage
Wisconsin also has certified construction apprenticeship programs operated by employers alone, but MEPI found that they enrolled only 23% of apprentices.
The investment in apprenticeship programs was similarly lopsided, the report finds. The spending on joint union-management programs totaled $64.3 million in 2022, compared with $2.9 million spent on the employer-only programs.
One reason for that gap is funding, Manzo said. Construction union labor agreements include a provision to cover the cost of apprenticeship programs as part of each worker’s total hourly wage and benefits.
“They’re funded by cents-per-hour contributions from employers that are used to train the next generation of skilled trades people,” Manzo said. “So, there’s always money for registered apprenticeship programs.”
By contrast, employer-only programs “rely entirely on voluntary contributions from those employers,” he said.
  Kent Miller, Wisconsin Laborers’ Union Council President/Business Manager
The study comes as the administration of Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers is proposing an administrative rule requiring that contractors employ apprentices as 10% of their workforce on state projects.
“These are all areas right now when we’re looking at how we can provide quality, middle class jobs,” said Kent Miller, president of the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council. The union represents a broad cross-section of construction workers.
“I’ve heard many times from members how an apprenticeship helped them get their first home,” Miller said. “As much as we can invest in Wisconsin workers it pays dividends down the road. That’s why the private sector union construction industry is making these investments in worker apprenticeship programs.”
Demands for skilled labor
MEPI’s study grew out of the nonprofit institute’s review of how states are responding to an increasing need for skilled labor.
“The construction industry is facing high demand for qualified tradespeople to modernize infrastructure, energy systems, domestic manufacturing facilities, and that’s really happening across the Midwest — across the Rust Belt,” Manzo said.
The research team expected to see Wisconsin among faster-growing states in apprenticeship enrollment. But while apprenticeship numbers have increased by nearly 50% from 2016 to 2024 in the state, “we found that this growth has actually lagged neighboring states that maintained policies that promote workforce training investments and policies that promote workers’ rights,” Manzo said.
The clearest correlation the researchers found was whether states required contractors to pay prevailing local wages on state-funded construction projects.
Just as a federal law known as the Davis-Bacon Act requires construction projects on federal facilities to pay prevailing wages, a number of states have similar laws for state and local government projects.
Contractors are hired for government projects typically based on the lowest bid. Prevailing wage laws require bidders to meet local wage standards, keeping them from cutting wages in order to win the contract.
The requirements “level the playing field,” said Miller, the Laborers union president. “It prevents out-of-state contractors from coming into Wisconsin, low-bidding taxpayer-funded projects, doing shoddy work and taking taxpayer dollars that we’d like to see stay here in Wisconsin.”
Wisconsin repealed its state prevailing wage law in 2017, however.
Encouraging training investments
The MEPI researchers found that in four nearby states — Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio — the number of construction apprentices increased by just over 63% from 2016 to 2024. All four states have maintained their state prevailing wage laws in that period, according to the report.

Prevailing wage laws “ensure that all firms — regardless of union status, by the way — would commit to these cents-per-hour contributions into registered apprenticeship programs while performing work on public works projects,” Manzo said.
Wisconsin’s “right-to-work” law, enacted in 2015, might also be holding down apprenticeship growth, the study’s authors suggest. Such laws forbid employers and unions from negotiating contracts that require all union-represented employees to either pay union dues or pay a fee towards the costs of the union’s work representing employees.
The law “is a government regulation that forces unions to represent nonmembers for free and erodes worker bargaining power by reducing the resources that unions would otherwise have to organize and provide resources and advocate for investments in training, job site safety and job quality,” Manzo said.
As he has in every budget he proposed, Evers included in his 2025-27 budget plan provisions to restore the state prevailing wage and end the right-to-work law. Both were among more than 600 items that the Republican majority of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee removed on their first day of budget deliberations Thursday.
Restoring Wisconsin prevailing wage law and repealing the right-to-work law would create an economic environment in which skilled trades workers know they will be supported, said Jacob Heger, an MEPI research analyst and coauthor of the report.
“They can go into these apprenticeship programs, they can get the quality training that they need and then they know that in public policy they’re backed up by what’s on the books [in state law], and that the people in their state capitols have their backs,” Heger said.

(Photo by Johner Images/Getty Images)(This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s suicide rate is over 60% higher than the national average and ranks in the top 10 states for suicide and suicidality, a report found. 
The Healthy Minds Policy Initiative found that nearly 8,000 Oklahomans died by suicide between 2013 and 2022, which equates to “two lives lost per day over a decade.” Most were gun-related deaths. Oklahoma’s rate of 21 suicide deaths per 100,000 people is well over the national rate of 14 for every 100,000, according to the report. 
Zack Stoycoff, executive director of the nonpartisan group of policy and mental health experts, said there are “common sense solutions” like reducing access to lethal options and increasing mental health screenings. 
“I think what we could learn from this is what circumstances are contributing to suicide and how complex that issue is,” he said. “… When we talk about the epidemic of suicide, we’re talking about the suffering and the circumstances that lead to suicidality and not just the deaths themselves.”
Stoycoff said 10,000 people a year are hospitalized because of suicidality, which is suicidal ideation or intent. Hospitalizations for suicide-related visits cost Oklahoma $139 million in 2022, according to the report. 
 
There are resources for those considering suicide.
988 is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. LGBTQ+ youth can also call the Trevor Project lifeline 24/7 at 1-866-488-7386 or call Rainbow Youth Project at 317-643-4888.


	Areas of Oklahoma with poor broadband access correlated with higher rates of suicidality, the report found. Many of these counties were in southeast Oklahoma. Pushmataha County had the highest suicide death rate. 
Stoycoff said this relates to a lack of access to services and communities, but that Oklahoma is doing “pretty well” expanding broadband access.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2024 that suicide rates were 44% lower in counties where most homes have broadband internet access. 
“Suicide does affect everybody, but in Oklahoma, suicide is a rural issue,” Stoycoff said. “I mean, we’re seeing that the largest suicide rates are in rural counties, and we have to look at how to expand our reach of services in rural counties.”
The report from Healthy Minds, released in conjunction with the start of Mental Health Awareness Month, also detailed trends in suicide rates by age, gender, race, contributing social and environmental factors, and history of mental health problems and treatment. 
Around 43% of people who died by suicide in Oklahoma between 2013 to 2022 had a known problem with mental health and a third were perceived, by themselves or others, to be depressed. Just over a quarter were in treatment for a mental health or substance use problem at the time of their death. 
Universal screening for mental health issues and suicidality could be a way to catch these issues early, Stoycoff said. 
“When you go to a health care provider or primary care physician, they’re going to check your vital signs. You can do blood pressure and weight, and we’re going to use those as measures of how well you are,” he said. “What we need to treat mental health as a vital sign. It needs to be part of how we practice medicine, because primary care is care for the entire body and the brain is part of the body.”
The report found that over 7% of Oklahomans between 15 and 24 years old made plans to attempt suicide, and 4.5% of children, ages 12 to 17, attempted suicide in 2021 and 2022. 
The rate of deaths by suicide for Native American Oklahomans surpassed white Oklahomans for the first time in 2020, the report stated. 
“The Legislature has generally been very supportive in passing positive legislation in recent years,” he said. “I think we can also appreciate the effort of mental health nonprofit providers who have expanded access to services. Many more people are being treated for mental health needs now than we’re being treated even a decade ago. That doesn’t mean that the need has gone down, it means the providers are trying to step up to meet the rising demand.”

(Photo by Jill Utrup/U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service) A proposed change to the federal Endangered Species Act would send Arkansas preservation efforts backwards amid an ongoing crisis, one state wildlife expert said.
Terri Lane, director of the Arkansas Wildlife Federation, said a recently proposed rule from President Donald Trump’s administration “removes an important level of protections, paving the way for increased habitat destruction.”
The rule, which is open for public comment through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service until May 19, would rescind the regulatory definition of “harm” in the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which has provided a framework to conserve and protect endangered and threatened species and their habitats.
The current definition of harm under the federal law includes habitat modification, and the proposed rule would remove that protection. According to information posted by the Federal Register, “harm” runs contrary to the best meaning of the statutory term “take.”
Nationally, environmentalists have said the proposed rule would gut habitat protections under the Endangered Species Act.
The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission tracks the state’s nearly 40 endangered species, including the hellbender — the largest salamander in North America — a number of fish, birds, bats and mollusks. An alligator and one beetle also make the list.

AGFC’s Arkansas Wildlife Action Plan, which is required of the state agency as part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s State Wildlife Grant program, identifies nearly 380 species of greatest conservation need in Arkansas. The plan was last updated in 2015, and its nearly 1,700 pages provides extensive detail on the state’s ecoregions, habitats, and the projected effects of climate change.
Nick Goforth, wildlife diversity program coordinator for AGFC, said, regardless of any changes to the Endangered Species Act, “we will continue to work collaboratively and consult with the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] to do what’s best for Arkansas’ wildlife and native habitats.”
Goforth said the agency is aware of the proposed changes to the federal law, but officials are still assessing how it would affect Arkansas’ endangered species and their role in implementing the Endangered Species Act.
‘Grassroots efforts must increase’
“Wildlife are in crisis,” said Lane, who has led the Arkansas Wildlife Federation, a decades-old independent watchdog organization, for the last two years. “They depend on a network of quality habitat to survive. In the short term, this rule change moves us backward in the fight to save already vulnerable species from further decline or extinction.”

Lane emphasized the importance of biodiversity, and said that complex interactions keep ecosystems healthy.
“The ecosystems upon which all life depends, including our own,” she said.
Looking further ahead, Lane said long-term effects would include a shift from collaborative efforts to solely the private sector. She predicted the rule change would increase the wildlife and biodiversity crisis, thus requiring more efforts, funding and regulatory protections in the future.
“Rule changes like this, particularly at a time when the agencies tasked with wildlife recovery are experiencing dramatic cuts to their budgets and workforce, mean that our grassroots efforts must increase,” Lane said. “The private and nonprofit sector must step in and fill the gaps, working with broad coalitions, sounding the alarm and finding solutions where species are being impacted.”
Trump, who recently celebrated the 100-day mark of his second term, has made scathing cuts to environmental programs nationwide. In Little Rock, AmeriCorps staff lost their funding; along the Buffalo National River, a visitor center closed in February after a wave of firings; and in Fayetteville, a major solar project at the University of Arkansas is stuck in limbo.
Slashes to programs championed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are expected to have an adverse effect on Arkansas food banks and farmers alike as they lose a major funding source for protein.
Currently, however, the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund seems unaffected. AGFC has received a number of these grants over the years, specifically for habitat preservation for the state’s endangered species.
Last June, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service awarded the state with a $2.2 million grant to protect the yellowcheek darter, a small freshwater fish, and other species. The AGFC and The Nature Conservancy — a national environmental group with offices in Little Rock and Fayetteville — provided matching funds and increased the total investment to nearly $3.1 million.

In Arkansas, allocations from the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund have been used to purchase more than 10,000 acres for the conservation of a variety of species. In 2020, more than 1,100 acres at the Beryl Anthony Lower Ouachita Wildlife Management Area were purchased for conservation of the red-cockaded woodpecker.
AGFC also offers conservation incentive programs to private landowners, but spokesperson Keith Stephens said they were more geared toward game animals than endangered species.
In a statement, Goforth said the state agency supports federal changes that aim to streamline the process of protecting endangered species.
“While the AGFC values the [Endangered Species Act] and the protections and benefits it offers, we are in support of any favorable reforms that would aim to address the challenges in its implementation and would work to streamline consultations and other processes, while both ensuring that its goals and objectives can be met more efficiently and effectively and also maintaining the existing protections for those listed species and their habitats, which are essential to their continued existence and recovery,” Goforth said.
Several organizations in Arkansas focus on the livelihood of the state’s endangered species, including the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission. Data gathered during on-the-ground field surveys to locate and evaluate endangered species help identify ecologically significant land most in need of protection, according to its website.
Spokesperson Danyelle McNeill deferred all questions about how the proposed rule may affect Arkansas animals to federal agencies. Answering for Director Jennifer Ballard, McNeill said the commission’s scope of services has currently not changed.
Taylor Pool, acting assistant regional director for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s southwest regional office, did not reply to specific questions about the proposed rule change.
“At this time, we have nothing for you,” Pool said.

(Getty Images)This story was first published by Idaho Reports on May 9, 2025.
Earlier this year, Idaho legislators passed a bill to allow some cases of lewd conduct with child under age 12 with aggravating circumstances to be punishable by death, despite knowing the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled a similar law unconstitutional.
The bill did not allocate any additional money for the Idaho State Public Defender’s Office. Instead, the fiscal note says the office will have additional expenditures should a defendant be assigned a public defender by the court.
This could be a major flaw. The challenge is more about more than just money. It’s about meeting what is required by law and agency rules – and when the death penalty is a possible sentence, those requirements are stricter than other criminal defense cases.
The Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution entitles all criminal defendants to a public attorney if they cannot afford one. But prior state rule and national legal guidance say defendants who are facing the death penalty require more representation. The court grants those defendants a lead counselor and co-counselor, sometimes referred to as the second chair attorney.
In 2024, prosecutors filed 382 charges of lewd conduct with a child under the age of 16, according to Idaho Supreme Court data. That doesn’t mean all of those led to convictions, and not all of those victims were 12 or younger.
Compare that to the 30 first-degree murder charges filed in 2024, according to Idaho Supreme Court data. Until House Bill 380’s passage, first-degree murder was the only crime punishable by death in Idaho.
Not all 30 of those charges would have been death penalty cases, as some would not have had necessary aggravating circumstances or a plea agreement could have been reached. Still, that’s less than one tenth of the charges filed of lewd conduct with a child under the age of 16.
 The Public Defense Commission and capital qualified defending attorneys

Under the Public Defense Commission’s now expired rules, any defendant who is charged with a crime that is potentially punishable by death required representation from a “capital qualified defending attorney.” The new Idaho Office of the Public Defender hasn’t yet adopted rules.
Capital qualified attorneys have advanced familiarity with the laws around capital mitigation and jury selection methods. They also meet or exceed American Bar Association Guidelines and criminal defense experience.

In an April interview with Idaho Reports, State Public Defender Eric Fredericksen said his understanding was that the Public Defense Commission’s rules became defunct after his office opened, but added he was not part of that decision-making process.
The Public Defense Commission first established rules in 2016 regarding caseloads and training for public defenders after a massive lawsuit, Tucker v. Idaho, found Idaho’s public defense system to be insufficient. The lawsuit is what led Idaho to the eventual establishment of a statewide public defense system. Until the Idaho Office of the Public Defender opened in October 2024, individual counties funded public defense.
Under the commission’s rules, lead counsel in a capital case needed at least 10 years in criminal defense and felony jury experience and have served as lead or co-counsel in at least one tried capital case to verdict, among other requirements.
Co-counsel must have at least five years in criminal defense and felony jury experience and have served as lead or co-counsel in at least one tried capital case to verdict, among other requirements.
The new Idaho Office of the Public Defender has been following the guidelines of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, but has no formal state rules of its own. Those association guidelines require less criminal defense experience than the state’s former rules, but still more than non-capital felony defense standards.
A handful of national organizations offer trainings for capital cases, but Fredericksen notes that making the case for life, as it’s often referred to by defense attorneys, is different in murder cases than it would be for lewd conduct cases. There’s a playbook for defense attorneys in capital murder cases. Having the death penalty on the table for lewd conduct creates a different scenario.
Why the extra rules? A person’s life is on the line.
 How many capital case attorneys does Idaho have?

As of April 23, Idaho had 13 attorneys who are qualified to be lead counsel on a capital case. Five are employees of the State Public Defender’s Office and eight are private attorneys. There are an additional 18 Idaho attorneys who qualify to be second chair on a capital case.
That means there are only 13 potential lawyers qualified to represent the people charged under the new crime of aggravated lewd conduct with a minor younger than age 12, on top of the other capital cases that may already be on their plates.
Prosecutors won’t necessarily seek the death penalty as punishment against every person who is charged with lewd conduct with a minor under 12, but the defense attorneys have an obligation to begin preparing as if it were at the time the charge is filing.
“The moment the charge of (aggravated lewd and lascivious) with a minor under 12 is filed, regardless of whether a death notice is filed, we will begin treating it as a death penalty case,” Fredericksen said. “So, two attorneys will be handling the case, find a mitigation expert, we find an investigator. You have to start that work on Day 1 because the prosecution starts that work on Day 1.”
 How much will additional death penalty cases cost the state of Idaho?

Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa
Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle
Fredericksen’s office remained neutral on the bill. He did write to sponsors Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, chairman of the House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee, and House Assistant Minority Leader Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, on March 14, stating that he did not have data on how many of the victims in cases they represented were 12 or younger, nor did he have data on how many of them had aggravating circumstances.
On March 18, the State Appellate Public Defender Erik Lehtinen wrote a letter to Senate Judiciary and Rules Committee Chairman Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, and cc’d the bill’s co-sponsors and Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee co-chairs Sen. Scott Grow and Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, about concerns about the bill’s potential impact on his office’s budget. Idaho Reports obtained a copy of the letter.
The State Appellate Public Defender’s Office handles cases post-conviction for appeals. Lehtinen estimated his office would receive, on average, two capital lewd conduct cases a year, in addition to the capital murder case appeals his office already handles.
“I estimate that once the new death penalty scheme fully ramps up, the SAPD would require at least $2,948,000 in additional ongoing funding – a 72.2% increase to the SAPD’s current annual appropriation,” wrote Lehtinen in his March 18 letter. That number included 14 new employees, litigation expenses and conflict costs. Lehtinen noted it did not include one-time costs, such as computers for the employees, or paying Idaho State Bar dues.
“This increase in capital cases would require the SAPD to hire at least 14 additional full-time employees in its Capital Litigation Unit: four lead attorneys, four ‘second chair’ attorneys, two investigators, two mitigation specialists and two administrative assistants or paralegals,” Lehtinen wrote.
Fredericksen told Idaho Reports that because public defense is so reactive to what the prosecution does, he couldn’t give a fiscal impact estimate. His office has begun accepting applications for attorneys who may have enough experience to become death penalty qualified.
But if half of the lewd conduct charges filed in 2024 involved children under age 12, he said, Idaho doesn’t have enough public, private, and civil attorneys to handle that case load.
The Idaho Legislature approved an $83 million budget for Fredericksen’s office for fiscal year 2026. About $32 million of that is an enhancement budget for needed personnel costs, institutional offices in Elmore, Shoshone, Jerome and Benewah counties and more funding for contract attorneys. The budget doesn’t specifically single out allocations for more death penalty-qualified attorneys.
 Bill creates new crime: aggravated lewd conduct under 16

When the new law goes into effect on July 1, it will create a new crime called “aggravated lewd conduct under 16” which creates a new mandatory minimum of 25 years for the crime of lewd conduct with a child ages 13 to 15. The option of pursuing the death penalty would be left to the individual county prosecutor in cases where the child is 12 or younger. The crime of lewd conduct with a child under 16 is already punishable by life in prison.
The bill outlines a series of 17 aggravating factors that make a suspect eligible for the death penalty, including the victim being kidnapped or trafficked, or the suspect engaging in the act three or more times.
If a jury, or the court if a jury is waived, finds two aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt and if the death penalty is not sought, the court shall impose a life sentence with a minimum period of no less than 30 years in prison.
Public defenders who testified in committee took issue with some of the items listed as aggravating factors, including if the defendant was in “a position of trust” over the victim because that could be applicable to many sexual assaults of children. Public defenders also objected to including “force or coercion” as an aggravating factor, as children cannot legally consent, so every case could arguably be “force or coercion.”
In committee, the Idaho Prosecutor’s Association supported the list of aggravating circumstances, saying they were based off Florida and Tennessee’s laws.
“I think it’s fair to say that with the nature of the aggravating factors, a prosecutor could make a decision that just about every case would meet those aggravating factors,” Fredericksen said. “Right or wrong, they could make the case to move forward with the aggravating factors under the statute.”
 Is Idaho’s new law constitutional? A former Supreme Court ruling offers clues. 

Idaho legislators passed this law knowing that in the 2008 decision Kennedy v. Louisiana, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the death penalty for non-fatal sex crimes, even if the crime involved brutality and young children.
Still, Florida passed a similar law in 2023, but to date, no one has been sentenced to death for child sexual assault. Instead, prosecutors have reached plea agreements with lesser punishments than executions, such as life in prison.
Tennessee passed a law similar to Florida’s in 2024, but it hasn’t yet been used.
During the session, Skaug repeatedly called the Idaho bill a “test case” as the makeup of SCOTUS has changed since 2008. He also believes prosecutors will only use the charge for “the worst of the worst.”
Of the four justices who dissented in Kennedy v. Louisiana, three – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas – are still on the bench. None of the five in the 2008 majority are currently serving.
Regardless of the current court makeup, if someone is sentenced to death under this new law, it will almost certainly end up challenged in court.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)May is the annual month designed to raise awareness for mental health issues. But unfortunately Oklahoma’s mental health agency is shining the wrong sort of spotlight on the issue.
Instead of focusing on how to improve outcomes for the 1 in 4 Oklahomans who suffer from mental illness, all eyes are on the massive amounts of financial disarray at the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services jeopardizing both employees and patient care.
Provider contracts have been cut or canceled. There’s been revelations that officials can’t figure out how to use their appropriated money to make payroll. The agency’s interim chief financial officer couldn’t answer basic questions about payroll costs or why the agency only needed $6.2 million to fill a $43 million shortfall. And, they haven’t been able to produce a budget for the upcoming fiscal year. 
The list goes on and on.
And it seems like every time our state mental health officials open their mouths, it exposes a new level of ineptitude.
Last week, Mental Health Commissioner Allie Friesen practically begged lawmakers to figure out her own agency’s budget woes when she’s supposed to be able to discuss the nuances of its over $600 million budget. 
Is it any wonder that lawmakers are growing increasingly frustrated?
Friesen, meanwhile, is pointing the finger at her predecessors.
She’s supposed to have been leading this agency since she was appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt in January 2024. 
But in blaming her predecessor, Carrie Slatton-Hodges, Friesen is pointing her finger at  Stitt, who appointed Slatton-Hodges and touted her as being a great fit.
I could see blaming her predecessor if Friesen was hired last month, but she’s been at the helm for over a year now. 
What has she been doingr?
Earlier this month I found myself chuckling grimly. As lawmakers were scrambling on a Friday to address revelations that the agency couldn’t pay its 2,000 employees, Friesen’s team put out a press release celebrating the resurrection of its halted naloxone vending machine project.
That’s the same program that Friesen abruptly shuttered in September because she said it wasn’t cost effective.
Offering free medication that reverses drug overdoses in vending machines as a way to help save lives and reduce the stigma is definitely a worthwhile program, and might be critical to the agency’s mission.
But so is paying the employees who are core to meeting a state agency’s goals.
Maybe that’s part of the issue. Perhaps Friesen doesn’t know what the core functions of mental health are and how to prioritize programs. Or maybe hers is an agency that doesn’t know how to live within the confines of a budget — or perhaps that it even has a budget.
After all, Friesen didn’t prioritize launching a search for a permanent, qualified CFO, until a day after lawmakers humiliated her interim one.
During public hearings, lawmakers flagged that the agency hired 20 employees with salaries of at least $100,000. A dozen employees saw their salaries raised to that level.
Lawmakers discovered that Skip Leonard, the agency’s now former interim CFO, was making $165 an hour — or up to $343,000 a year — despite not being a certified public accountant and having no experience running finances for a state agency. 
At another hearing, Friesen brought with her an employee she hired just over a month ago to work in her “operational excellence division.”
There is no “operational excellence” going on right now.
It all gives the impression that Friesen is just creating random jobs or promoting people into high-paying jobs without an ounce of cents — literally.
Hiring people at high salaries for state jobs might explain why the agency suddenly can’t make payroll. Creating random divisions that seemingly go beyond the agency’s core mission is a head scratcher.
There’s no excuse for this level of ineptitude. It seems like it might be time to go back to basics and get better at providing the core services before looking at adding in shiny objects that look pretty but aren’t necessary to function.
It boggles the mind that Stitt – who, like other Republicans, promises to run state government like a business – continues to defend Friesen.
If anybody else ran a business in such a haphazard way, their governing board would fire them.
So let’s hope that Stitt knows something the rest of us don’t and that he can get the wheels back on this clown car before it hurts the people who rely on it most — our mentally ill and the people that care for them.

“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.
23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Stock.adobe.com photo by smolaw11)Here’s an oddity. For all that has been said about the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, there has been hardly a word about class size. The subject has not even been debated.
That’s a shocker. Common sense supports lower class sizes: The fewer the students in class, the more attention teachers can pay to individual student needs. Teachers almost unanimously think “smaller classes would strongly boost student learning.”
So why the omission in the Blueprint?
For one thing, the Kirwan Commission ducked the issue, largely under the influence of its chief consultant who didn’t think class size matters much if at all.  For another, for decades, the importance of class size has been a raging battleground between liberals on one side (it matters) and conservatives on the other (it’s a poor use or waste altogether of scarce funds).
The controversy also endures because research is mixed. One summary of the research concludes “Students often do better in smaller classes. But there’s no agreement on exactly how much better, and it remains an open question whether or not class reduction is a particularly good use of funds that could go elsewhere.”
The uncertainty is not surprising, given the many possible variations of the policies that are being researched. For example, class sizes may differ by the actual class-size limit, by grade level, and by targeted student population (usually students who are of color and low-income and in early grades).




Your opinion matters
Maryland Matters welcomes guest commentary submissions at editor@marylandmatters.org.
We suggest a 750-word limit and reserve the right to edit or reject submissions. We do not accept columns that are endorsements of candidates, and no longer accept submissions from elected officials or political candidates.
Opinion pieces must be signed by at least one individual using their real name. We do not accept columns signed by an organization. Commentary writers must include a short bio and a photo for their bylines.
Views of writers are their own.




Still, there is clear evidence behind selective limits on class size. Northwestern University economist Diane Schanzenbach sums it up: “The payoff from class-size reduction is greater for low-income and minority children, while any increases in class size will likely be most harmful to these populations.” Smaller classes in the early grades, in particular, matter a lot.
That’s the state of the research, but what’s going on with state and local policies that govern class size? According to a survey by the National  Council on Teacher Quality,  90% of local school districts have class-size limits, “with state policy playing a direct role.” A majority of states have such policies; however, they’re all over the map in their exact requirements.
Regrettably, Maryland is one of the states without any kind of statewide class-size policy. We have regulations on staffing ratios in child care settings, but no statewide law imposing hard caps on pre-K to 12 classrooms. In the absence of a statewide policy, local school districts vary widely in their approaches. Unfortunately, there is no summary of the different local policies or reports on whether class-size policies are being implemented with fidelity.
The most common argument against class-size reductions is the shortage of teachers. No doubt shortages are severe, and in the past session of the General Assembly, Gov. Wes Moore blamed teacher shortages for his attempt to slash funds in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future intended to hire more teachers for “collaborative time” — to reduce the number of hours teachers spend teaching the whole class, allowing more time planning and tutoring. (His proposals were partially adopted – causing the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars that could have been redirected to fill big holes in funding throughout the Blueprint.)
Moreover, teacher shortages could be significantly reduced by recruiting more teacher who only tutor small groups of students. Many teachers would be attracted by the chance to be full- or part-time tutors, rather than regular classroom teachers.
One other fly in the class-size ointment.is worthy of mention. Champions of smaller classes must overcome the frequent assertions by former U. S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and others that it’s better to have a great teacher than a small class. But that’s a generalization that hides the reality that some class sizes are now huge, often as high as 35 students; and classes with many low-performing students, especially in the early grades, must have low teacher-to-student ratios to meet student needs.
What should Maryland do?

End the long failure to study and debate a statewide class-size policy. Let voices on all sides of the debate be heard.
Join most other states in allowing union bargaining over class size. According to the Maryland State Education Association, we are one of only nine states where class size is not negotiable at the bargaining table. MSEA has tried without success to get the General Assembly to change this.
Focus on class sizes in the pivotal kindergarten to third grades.
Fill up and speed up the teacher pipeline through incentives and focusing on tutor recruitment.
Enforce existing and future class-size requirements. Too often, the laws are “policy without consequences” because of non-compliance by school districts.

If there’s a political will to reduce class sizes, there’s a way. Policymakers should follow the research and selectively lower class sizes based on evidence of where there will be maximum payoff.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AdobeStock_268991911-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-12 07:05:10.087379

Before making its final decision, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality will accept public comments through May 21.
The post Wyoming intends to approve Microsoft data centers’ emissions permit for 128 backup diesel generators appeared first on WyoFile .","State air quality regulators are seeking public comment on Microsoft’s proposal to install a battery of 128 diesel-fired electric generators associated with new data and computing facilities it plans to construct five miles southeast of Cheyenne.
Microsoft, which already operates a handful of data centers in and around Cheyenne, has a contract with local electric provider Black Hills Energy. The diesel generators are likely only for backup power, Cheyenne Mayor Patrick Collins told WyoFile, “in case power is interrupted for whatever reason.”
The company must obtain an emissions permit from the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality’s air quality division, as well as approval from the agency for a series of associated storage tanks that would hold up to 1.8 million gallons of diesel fuel, according to state documents.
This rendering depicts a Microsoft data center. (screenshot of Microsoft webpage)
The DEQ issued a notification in April saying it proposes to approve the permit, but will first consider public comments, which are being accepted through May 21. Unless an “aggrieved party” requests one, the DEQ does not intend to hold a public hearing on the permit application, according to the agency.
The permit would allow certain levels of emissions that include pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are sometimes associated with ozone or haze, according to filings with the state.
Microsoft proposes to build four more facilities in the area, according to Collins. The company’s data centers in Wyoming now employ 85 people, according to a Microsoft fact sheet. It expects to employ 335 full-time workers by the end of 2026. The company has pledged to become carbon-negative by 2030.

Organizing is a routine part of legislating, so why is it a problem when the Wyoming Freedom Caucus does so, Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams asks.
The post When conservatives organize, the left cries foul appeared first on WyoFile .","Every morning of the legislative session, Wyoming lawmakers receive a flood of emails, texts and hallway ambushes from lobbyists, associations and interest groups offering their “vote recommendations.” This is a routine part of legislating. Yet, when conservative legislators in the Wyoming Freedom Caucus coordinate successfully on policy and receive support aligned with our principles, suddenly, the pearl-clutching begins. 

Opinion

The accusation that members of the WYFC are “told how to vote every morning” is not just wrong — it’s a smokescreen. Vote recommendations are everywhere in the Capitol. The liberal County Commissioners Association regularly sends out its preferred positions — including opposition to property tax relief and opposition to a bill that would require government meetings to be streamed online. Wyoming AARP has aggressively lobbied against common-sense election integrity reforms, such as Voter ID requirements. The Wyoming Education Association begged lawmakers to vote against school choice. Every day during the session, lobbyists line the hallway outside the House chambers, ready to pounce on lawmakers from all sides of the political spectrum with talking points and pressure tactics. 
No one seems bothered by these daily attempts to influence policy — unless, of course, those recommendations come from a conservative source. That’s the double standard. No one complains when a lobbying group on the left hands out voting guides, tracks scores or testifies in committee meetings. No one bats an eye when progressive organizations coordinate efforts across the state. But when a group of conservative lawmakers stands up, says “we’re organized,” and follows through with a consistent commitment to limited government, individual liberty and fiscal responsibility — suddenly it’s a scandal. 
This criticism is intentional deception. Those who rail against the WYFC aren’t truly upset about vote recommendations — they’re upset about the votes themselves. They’re angry that conservatives are gaining traction in Wyoming, exposing government overreach, and pushing back on policies that tax too much, spend too freely and trample on citizens’ rights. So instead of engaging on the actual issues, our critics resort to tired attacks and manufactured outrage. 
The bottom line is this: vote recommendations only became a problem when conservatives got organized and successful. Like all the other parroting attacks on the Freedom Caucus, this latest round of complaints is just another tactic from the left, and Republicans who collaborate with them, to hide their deep and unpopular disdain for the policies and freedom we stand for. 
We won’t be distracted. We’ll keep fighting for the people of Wyoming — and those who elected each of our members will tell us how to do it.

Neubauer takes questions from reporters alongside Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein in Jan. 2025. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer is joining the Board of Directors for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) — the national organization dedicated to electing Democrats to state legislatures.
The Racine Democrat, who has been in the Legislature since 2018 and has led Assembly Democrats since 2021, joins the board as Wisconsin Democrats seek majorities in both chambers for the first time in many years in 2026.
Neubauer said DLCC President Heather Williams asked her to join the board and it’s a sign of the organization’s “deep commitment” to Wisconsin and understanding that a trifecta could be possible in 2026. 
“They want to be a part of helping us flip this state blue,” Neubauer said. “DLCC of course is focused on the national strategy of supporting democratic legislatures to win majorities in legislative chambers. They have had great success in the last few years… so I’m excited to be part of that national strategy work.” 
Williams said in a statement that “all eyes should be on the states in 2025” and Neubauer is a leader to watch. 
“As state Democrats continue to overperform in special elections and counter the chaos in Washington, we are laying the foundation for Democratic success up and down the ticket,” Williams said. “Our board members represent some of the sharpest minds in politics, and I’m excited to partner with them to build our plan for victory for cycles to come.” 
In the past, the DLCC has invested in helping Wisconsin Democrats win and outlined strategies for winning targeted seats.
Neubauer said it has been helpful getting to know leaders in other states where Democrats have successfully flipped control of their legislative chambers including Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania. She said she has learned a lot from those leaders and is trying to bring those lessons back to Democrats in Wisconsin, especially when it comes to preparing to be in the majority. 
“When we do win, we want to take advantage of the opportunity and pass policy that is going to materially improve people’s lives very quickly, so that’s been really helpful to me to speak with them about how they prepared to govern, how they worked with their caucuses,” Neubauer said, adding that Democrats have 10 new Assembly members this year and hope to grow that number now that the Legislature has passed new maps that no longer overwhelmingly favor Republicans. “The level of program that we run during the campaign cycle, the amount of money we need to raise and candidates we’re supporting has grown significantly since we got the fair maps. I’m getting all sorts of advice from those leaders both about governing and about effectively campaigning, winning majorities.” 
When it comes to its targets for 2025-26, Wisconsin is one of five of the DLCC’s “battleground” states where legislative majorities are determined by the slimmest of margins. 
New legislative maps were put in place last year by the state Legislature and Gov. Tony Evers after the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the old maps were an unconstitutional gerrymander. Democrats in Wisconsin haven’t held a legislative majority in the Senate or Assembly since 2010, and under the old maps, Senate Republicans were able to win two-thirds of the seats, while Republicans held a 64-35 majority.
Under the new maps, Democrats in 2024 were able to pick up 10 Assembly seats and now hold 45 of 99 seats. They also added four Senate seats and now hold 15 seats out of 33 in that chamber.
Wisconsin’s 2026 elections will be the first time that control of the Senate will be in play as only half of the body was up in the last election and Assembly Democrats will again be working to try to win a majority.
“It is absolutely doable, but it is going to take quite a bit of work,” Neubauer said. 
Democratic lawmakers, she said, are taking a few approaches to getting things done for voters ahead of the next elections. This includes working across the aisle in the budget process to get investment into programs that Wisconsinites rely on, including child care and public schools and ensuring “Republican attacks on our rights and freedoms are not successful” by upholding the governor’s veto. 
Neubauer said her party is also “focused on that long-term vision and communicating what we will do when we have a Democratic trifecta — how we will change the state, how we will make Wisconsin a place where everyone has the ability to thrive, wants to live, raise a family, retire.” She noted that Democrats introduced a package of bills in January to address prescription drug access, ensure students have access to food in school and help improve housing, but Republicans haven’t shown interest in them. 
“We have a big and deep policy agenda that we’ve been working on for over a decade that we are ready to implement, and so we just have to get out and communicate about it,” Neubauer said. “And that of course looks like fanning out across the state, both in districts we represent and other communities, and talking about the work that we need to get done.” 
Neubauer said they are going to continue to work to lower costs, especially as “Trump engages in reckless, irresponsible trade wars and weakens the economy for no good reason.” She said state legislatures are essential in pushing back on his agenda.
The first part of Trump’s term in office could have an effect on Wisconsin Democrats’ chances as well, Neubauer said. 
“We have a number of Republican legislators who have really tried to position themselves as being moderate. They go home to their districts and they emphasize the bipartisan proposals that they’ve signed on to or tried to get passed, but what they don’t talk about is their voting record being in line with Republican leadership almost 100% of the time,” Neubauer said. 
Neubauer said that Wisconsin Republicans haven’t distanced themselves from Trump’s  agenda. 
“The first several months of the legislative session here in Wisconsin, we saw Republicans focused on culture wars rather than lowering costs for working families, making their lives easier, investing in our schools — the things that we all hear about when we run into our constituents at the grocery store,” Neubauer said. “Republicans are going to have to answer for Donald Trump and his attacks on Wisconsin families next year, and that is going to be difficult for them to do in extremely purple districts.”
Wisconsin’s gubernatorial election is also coming up in November 2026. Evers hasn’t said whether he’ll run for a third term, saying he’ll likely decide after the next budget is done. Republican Josh Schoemann, who serves as the county executive of Washington, is the first candidate to announce his campaign.
“We’re all eagerly awaiting that decision,” Neubauer said of Evers’ choice whether to make a re-election bid. “[I] always look forward to working with the governor.”
Neubauer is one of seven legislative leaders joining the DLCC board alongside California Speaker of the Assembly Robert Rivas, Colorado Senate President James Coleman, Illinois Speaker Pro Tempore Kam Buckner, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, Oregon Speaker of the House Julie Fahey and Virginia Speaker of the House Don Scott. 
New York Senate President Pro Tempore and Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who also serves as the DLCC chair, said in a statement that she is thrilled Neubauer is joining. 
“There has never been a more important time to ensure we have battle-tested, experienced leaders at the helm of Democratic strategy in the states as Donald Trump upends Washington and our economy,” Stewart-Cousins said, adding that Neubauer “embodies the diverse expertise needed to drive and elevate our strategy to build durable state power through the end of the decade.”

Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, thanks supporters after being elected speaker of the House at the Virginia State Capitol on Jan. 10, 2024. (Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, is joining the board of directors of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), the national party’s state-level strategy arm, just as Virginia enters one of its most consequential election years in recent memory.
The DLCC  will draw on Scott’s experience — alongside that of six other new board members from around the country — to help shape its plans to support state legislative races this year and beyond.
With all 100 seats in Virginia’s House of Delegates seats and the state’s entire executive branch up for election this year, DLCC President Heather Williams emphasized that “all eyes are on Virginia.”
Speaking by phone on Friday, Scott described the commonwealth as both an “incubator for democracy” and a “bellwether for the rest of the country.”
Virginia holds its gubernatorial elections the year after each presidential contest, which offers national observers a fresh barometer on public sentiment. This year, Democrats are framing the races as a referendum on President Donald Trump and his influence over the Republican Party. 
But Scott stressed that all elections are also inherently local. Each House race will also revolve around  hallmark issues for Virginia Democrats — including advancing three constitutional amendments on voting rights, reproductive freedom and marriage equality — alongside regional issues like infrastructure and the economy. 
“People are really concerned about kitchen-table issues,” Scott said. 
His appointment to the DLCC’s board of directors comes on the heels of the organization announcing a seven figure investment in Virginia’s elections this year. The state is one of several battlegrounds identified in the organization’s 2025-2026 Target Map, which also includes North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona. The committee aims to help Democrats flip legislatures or build stronger democratic bases. 
Others joining Scott on the DLCC board include legislative leaders from California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Oregon and Wisconsin. 
“Our board members represent some of the sharpest minds in politics, and I’m excited to partner with them to build our plan for victory for cycles to come,” DLCC president Williams said in a recent statement.  
While the DLCC’s core mission has always been state legislature races, this year the group also plans to boost the eventual Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. While the state Senate — where Democrats hold a slim majority — is not on the ballot, the next lieutenant governor could play a key role in breaking future ties. 
As the DLCC falls under the Democratic National Committee umbrella, the overarching organization has also recently announced a funding focus to help boost state elections. DNC chair Ken Martin announced last month that the organization will transfer more than $1 million per month to its state and territorial parties over the next four years.
“When we organize everywhere to compete everywhere, we can win anywhere,” he said on a press call during the announcement. “The role of political parties is to build infrastructure everywhere.”
That infusion comes as Democrats are running candidates in all 100 House districts. Some are incumbents or former candidates returning for a rematch in competitive districts; others are fresh faces stepping up through recruitment efforts. 
Much of that  recruitment has been led by  Dr. Fergie Reid Jr., whose father, Dr. William “Fergie” Reid Sr., became the first Black elected official in Virginia after  Reconstruction. Reid Jr., a retired physician, has spent the past decade working to ensure Democrats contest every district — from the safest blue districts to the reddest red — to help build a base and spark party enthusiasm. 
“Dad turned 100 a few weeks ago. There are 100 districts in the state house,” Reid recently told The Mercury. “My goal is not to let what happened in 2021 happen again, especially on Dad’s 100th year when he’s watching. He’s been calling me every night to make sure that we get in 100 districts.”
Meanwhile, Scott, the first Black House speaker in Virginia history, hopes to share what his home state has learned with Democrats in other states. In  2023, Scott helped his party claw back its majority in the House of Delegates, which set the stage for his ascension to speaker. 
“The number one thing that we’ve learned is that we have to meet people where they are,” Scott said. “Most people are trying to figure out how they put food on the table, how they afford the things that they need, whether they have good schools for their kids, and whether it’s safe to live in the community, and that’s what we’ve been focused on.”

This year, volunteers are prepping for an event with fewer National Park Service staff amid federal funding cuts. (Photo provided by National Park Service)The third full weekend in June is always the busiest part of the summer at Fort Union Trading Post near Williston, North Dakota.
This is when the National Park Service historic site hosts its Rendezvous, which draws about 3,000 visitors.
This year, however, the event has been in flux as organizers adapt to ever-changing federal funding streams and staffing models. Within the span of a few days, Rendezvous 2025 was canceled and then added back to the summer schedule.
“It’s whiplash for all of us involved,” said Megan Halvorson, executive director of the Fort Union Association, a nonprofit that promotes and supports the historic site. “There are a lot of unknowns.”
Rendezvous is Fort Union’s biggest event. Over five days, more than 100 living historians recreate what life was like in the 1800s when trappers and traders gathered at the post to exchange furs and goods. 
Rendezvous was canceled in early April because of a shortage of summer staff at the historic site, Halvorson said. But once the cancellation was announced, the regional National Park Service office said the event needed to go on, she said.

The event relies heavily on volunteers but needs National Park Service staff to oversee those volunteers, she said. Historically, Fort Union has hired six rangers to cover the busy season. In addition, rangers from other national park sites have been assigned to help with the Rendezvous weekend.
Because of federal hiring freezes earlier in the year, the park service fell behind in its seasonal hiring and Fort Union was able to secure only one long-term ranger plus three short-term rangers for this summer, Halvorson said.
That’s not enough staff to make sure the event runs smoothly and safely, she said.
The park’s superintendent referred all questions to the National Park Service regional office. Calls to the regional office were not returned.
Fort Union’s experience is not uncommon, said Bill Wade, executive director of the Association of National Park Rangers.
A cycle of firings and reinstatements and buyouts has led to a loss of permanent employees. The total number is unclear, Wade said, because National Park Service employees have been told not to speak about personnel issues. 
Still, his association estimates up to 2,500 employees have left the park system. And while the service was eventually authorized to hire more seasonal employees than usual, that permission came late.
“It takes a while to get those people trained and on board,” Wade said. “What we’re seeing is some positions may not be filled early in the season.”
In addition, he said the recent chaos and confusion has led to low morale among those who have stayed. 
“There’s anger and fear among employees who are just trying to do their job,” he said. “We’re expecting there will be more disruption and significant impacts on park resources in the future.”
Halvorson says more than 10,000 visitors come through Fort Union each year. She and other members of the Fort Union Association provide as much support to the historic site as they can. The association runs a park store and members are organizing a fundraiser to help hire additional staff.
Still, Halvorson said people who value National Park Service sites need to contact their local congressional representatives. That’s the best way to support them, she said.
In the meantime, the association will recruit even more volunteers to make sure Rendezvous goes smoothly.
“We’ll find people to fill gopher holes and set up awnings. We’ll ask our local civic organizations for help in setting up picnic tables and garbage cans,” she said. “We’ll do what we can to make sure it goes on.”
Those who visit Fort Union for the big June event will see blacksmiths crafting nails and horseshoes. They’ll watch demonstrators spin wool into yarn and learn how traders used Plains Indian Hand Talk to speak with each other. They’ll see a keel boat, which was the primary way of transporting goods up and down the river.
“It will feel alive out there,” Halvorson said.

Women should keep this number filed away, especially those who live in remote rural areas of the Gem State. This is the number to call if you want to get out of an abusive relationship, which may include domestic violence or sexual assault.
That’s the number of the Women’s & Children’s Alliance hotline, where a friendly voice will hear your story and direct you to resources in your area. The WCA fields almost 4,500 calls a year, so don’t think you are alone with this situation.
Bea Black has heard her share of stories during her 17 years as WCA’s executive director, and she cringes at just about every one of those tales.
“It’s chilling what individuals can do to others,” she says.
While listening to horror stories is not the most pleasant aspect of her job, what she does afterward keeps her going to work every day. With a team of 56 who come to the rescue of women and children going through some form of domestic abuse, Black’s role is to promote those efforts.
“These are the real heroes of the story about the WCA. These are the ones helping the people during the worst times of their lives,” she says. “For me as the spokesperson, I have the opportunity to provide education about our services and how those services impact the people in our community.”
Of course, that’s only a snapshot of what she does. A CEO can make, or break, an organization and Black’s record is one of resounding success. She’s not an expert in the field of domestic abuse (her background is as a CPA and entrepreneur), but her work history has helped give the WCA a strong footing. She also knows enough to let the field experts do their jobs.
Within the WCA, there are the “technicians” (guardian angels) who sit with the children and moms who are going through monumental pain. The court advocates who tirelessly work on obtaining restraining orders. The counselors who help clients process their trauma. And the case managers who help figure out what’s next in the victims’ lives, starting with the basics.
Black lists some of the questions: “Do I need a job? Do I need to learn how to drive, because I’ve never been allowed to handle a vehicle? Do I need to get a GED, because I never finished school?”
Then, there are people who work at the WCA shelter – supplying a safe temporary home for abuse victims. Women and children can stay up to seven months, but the average stay is 90-120 days. The WCA also works with other community agencies to provide low-cost housing. 
“We have two buildings with a total of 30 rooms. At the end of last month we had 27 women and 20 kids that were sheltered. In a year, we serve over 200 women and children,” Black says. “Our mission is safety, healing and freedom from domestic abuse and sexual assault.”
The WCA doesn’t win them all. Some women, for whatever the reason are unable to break the cycle. And some abuse cases are not as clear-cut as others.
“We use the term ‘abuse’ because it’s a broader term. Domestic abuse is more ambiguous, because in many cases there are no black eyes or broken arms. There often is no outward sign of abuse, but it’s there. It’s all about control and the eventual outcome depends on how fixated that control is,” Black says.
“Not everybody is going to be able to break the cycle and move forward,” she says. “It takes an average of seven attempts for someone to leave an abusive situation. It’s like breaking a bad habit, such as smoking or alcohol abuse.”
But it’s the success stories that make the WCA such a valuable lifeline. Black tells a story about a mother and three daughters who moved into the WCA shelter, and some of the challenges that went with that transition. 
“I could hear the difference in their voices and the ways they interacted,” she said. “When the girls started counseling, there was anger and unpleasant interaction – particularly with the older ones. The mom gained some culinary skills and ended up taking a job in a grocery store, and you could tell that the kids were much happier. They were admiring what their mom had done.”
The work and challenges of the WCA are incredibly difficult, as Black will attest, but the victories are worth celebrating.
“I tell people that I have the best job in the world,” Black says.

SoMa Pride will return this June 7 “no matter what,” organizer Elizabeth Michael said — even if a funding shortage forces it to downsize.
The SoMa 501 nonprofit, of which Michael is executive director, launched a crowdfunding campaign in March with a goal of $20,000 to “bridge the gap” after losing “a few major funding sources.” As of Wednesday, the campaign had raised $2,320 from 42 supporters.
SoMa Pride is co-hosted by Central Arkansas Pride, which also hosts LGBTQ+ events in October, and SoMa 501. Organizers for June’s events are not alone in their crowdfunding efforts; NWA Equality, which runs Northwest Arkansas Pride, raised over $30,000 in early April to make up for lost event sponsors.
Even so, most of Northwest Arkansas Pride’s sponsors have maintained their support, which director Richard Gathright said he appreciates.
“When I started doing this in 2018, our budget was $50,000, but as we’ve grown and expectations have grown, the event’s now a little over $300,000 to put on,” Gathright said.
Michael said she won’t “point fingers” at any entities that rescinded funding, and she noted that Arkansas’ situation is not unique. Pride festivities in major cities nationwide this year have lost major corporate sponsors, such as Anheuser Busch in St. Louis and Target in Minnesota’s Twin Cities. The changes have come as state and federal officials have targeted LGBTQ+ rights and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
Arkansas Legislative Black Caucus voices disappointment in Walmart’s DEI rollback

Walmart rolled back its DEI policies last year, but Gathright said the Bentonville-based retailer has never been a Northwest Arkansas Pride sponsor.
Gathright and Michael both said the funding shortages are related to the current precarity of federal funds. President Donald Trump’s administration has frozen the disbursement of grants for diversity initiatives and federal funding for hospitals, among other things. Gathright said Northwest Arkansas Pride regularly gets support from local hospitals.
Michael called economic struggles and the political climate “a perfect storm” for Pride organizing, but noted that several entities continue to support the cause, including the Little Rock Convention and Visitors Bureau.
SoMa is short for “South on Main” and encompasses Little Rock’s business district on Main Street just south of Interstate 630. Some of those businesses are LGBTQ-owned, and a Pride flag is painted on the pavement at the intersection of Main and 12th streets.
Both SoMa and Northwest Arkansas’ Pride festivities will include a parade and performance art such as live music. SoMa Pride might have fewer performers than last year if it doesn’t meet its fundraising goal, Michael said.
The event had two stages last year but is expected to have only one this year. Even so, the organizers had booked four musical acts as of Wednesday, Michael said. She added that SoMa 501 could raise money with a Pride “pre-party” or similar events, weather permitting, so “all hope is not lost.”
 LGBTQ+ persistence

Pride events and the LGBTQ+ community nationwide have not always had the amount of support from businesses, corporations or politicians that they have had in recent years, said Evelyn Rios Stafford, a Washington County justice of the peace from Fayetteville. She is Arkansas’ first and only out transgender elected official, and she said she has been attending Pride events since the early 1990s, and not just in Arkansas.

“Whether there’s corporate sponsorship or not, people were able to make that happen 30 years ago,” Rios Stafford said. “If we have to go back to that grassroots kind of organizing, I think that’s still worthwhile. I think visibility today is now more important than ever.”
Northwest Arkansas Pride has drawn tens of thousands of attendees each year for the past few years, and state Rep. Tippi McCullough, D-Little Rock, said the magnitude of the event gives her “chills just thinking about it.”
McCullough is the only out LGBTQ+ member of the Arkansas Legislature. She has seen support for LGBTQ+ Arkansans “ebb and flow” over time, she said, and she appreciates the growth of Pride festivities outside Central and Northwest Arkansas, the state’s most populous areas, and Eureka Springs, which is known as a haven for LGBTQ+ people.
McCullough’s hometown of Hot Springs will host a Pride parade June 7, and Batesville, Fort Smith and Russellville had Pride celebrations in 2024. Saline County scheduled but later canceled a Pride event last year.
“Every LGBTQ person in Arkansas should know that there is a community out there, that there are people like them and that there are people who care about them,” McCullough said.
The Legislature has passed several laws in the last few sessions that McCullough and other Democrats have criticized as unfairly targeting LGBTQ+ people. One such law from the session that just ended will allow Arkansans to sue for damages if they encounter someone in a bathroom, changing room, shelter or correctional facility who does not align with the “designated sex” of the space. Another law would protect Arkansas government employees from adverse employment action if they refuse to do something within the context of their jobs that conflicts with their “sincerely held religious beliefs,” such as providing a marriage license to a same-sex couple.
  Rep. Tippi McCullough, D-Little Rock (John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)
Discriminatory legislation can be “a Catch-22,” McCullough said.
“These bills being brought up every year helps, in some ways, to fuel Pride events, because there’s such a reason to make sure that we have them,” she said.
Gathright and Michael agreed that persistence and togetherness in the face of adversity are not just helpful but necessary for LGBTQ+ Arkansans.
“Something that was really heartwarming for me last year was to hear stories of 16-year-olds from rural Arkansas who came to SoMa Pride and said this is the first time they’ve been around other people like them, and the first time they felt safe and welcome being who they are,” Michael said.
Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, a well-known transgender advocate who lives in Little Rock, will be the grand marshal of this year’s SoMa Pride parade. Griffin-Gracy was present at the 1969 Stonewall riot between LGBTQ+ people and police in New York City, a pivotal event in the LGBTQ+ rights movement that advocates say paved the way for Pride celebrations.
Gathright said Pride continues to be a form of protest, especially in the current political climate.
“I’m going to keep fighting for LGBTQ rights as long as I can and keep making sure that we have Pride, that people can come to enjoy themselves, be themselves and not have to worry about much of anything,” Gathright said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The most common question many Nebraskans have asked of state lawmakers considering legislative regulations for new medical cannabis laws is, “Why?”
At a series of public forums this month in La Vista, Omaha and Lincoln, some supporters of medical cannabis asked why state senators were even entertaining Legislative Bill 677 a half-year after Nebraskans approved legalizing and regulating medical cannabis. 
Voters overwhelmingly approved two ballot measures last November. The one to legalize medical cannabis secured 71% approval. A companion regulatory measure won with 68% of the vote.

State Sens. Ben Hansen of Blair, Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha and Terrell McKinney of Omaha attended earlier forums. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The answer to why lawmakers are considering changing those laws largely has to do with setting aside state funds for the new regulatory commission voters approved and setting up additional guardrails in the face of bureaucratic and executive branch opposition to medical cannabis, limits on how much a ballot measure can accomplish in a single vote and continued legal challenges.
Hansen has repeatedly said the way Nebraska handles medical cannabis could become the “wild west” if the Legislature doesn’t pass LB 677, largely because of the lack of funding.
“We will essentially have nothing in the State of Nebraska,” Hansen told reporters last week. “You want to talk about denying the will of the voters, turning a blind eye to a ballot initiative that actually helps some individuals in the State of Nebraska who really need help? That’s undermining the will of the voters.”
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, who opposes medical cannabis and has supported efforts to stop the bill from being implemented, has argued that allowing the laws to take effect as-is would be better for the “will of the people,” which Hansen rejects as “false hope.”
The sponsors of the medical cannabis ballot measures in Nebraska support Hansen’s LB 677.
Funding for new regulatory commission
Among the top concerns for the new voter-created Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which has sole regulatory authority over medical cannabis, is getting the regulatory process moving so physicians can recommend the medicine and patients can legally buy it in the state.
While voters passed a regulatory measure setting a July 1 deadline to set new regulations and an Oct. 1 deadline to start licensing medical dispensaries, dispersing state funds is a power reserved to the Nebraska Legislature. This means the new regulators have no funding set aside for the new commission through the end of this fiscal year, June 30. 
The proposed state budget for the next two years would earmark an additional $30,000 for any Medical Cannabis Commission work taken on by Nebraska Liquor Control Commission employees. When voters approved creating the Medical Cannabis Commission, they assigned those additional duties to the three commissioners on the Liquor Control Commission.
But the state budget creates no new and separate line item for the Medical Cannabis Commission.
LB 677 provides a path to getting the commission more funding, though how much will be difficult in the face of a major projected budget deficit. The bill would also explicitly allow the commissions to share staff and resources.
Nebraska attorney general steps up medical cannabis opposition, regulatory bill awaits debate

Hilgers has argued the Medical Cannabis Commission should be drafting regulations anyway, despite a late March court filing from the commissioners that they have “no ability to carry out any duties” outlined in the new laws without funding, such as creating open meetings notices or paying staff.
As of March, that meant no meetings. No deliberations. No votes. No employees. No regulations.
Some state lawmakers have also questioned an assertion from Hilgers, a former speaker of the Legislature, that the Liquor Control Commission could expend its already appropriated funds to regulate cannabis and then request those funds be reimbursed next year. Some senators question whether doing so would be allowed.
The Legislature might not approve such a reimbursement, and Hilgers’ office has vowed to sue the commissioners if they begin to license medical cannabis dispensaries anyway.
Continued legal challenges
LB 677 continues to face opposition from some state senators who look to Hilgers’ ongoing and pledged legal challenges against the underlying cannabis laws as a reason for hesitancy.
However, passage of LB 677 could weaken and possibly nullify a pending appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court, led by Hilgers and a former state senator who has long opposed marijuana. 
Hilgers speculated last week that if LB 677 passed, “it makes our job a lot more difficult to what we think should be a fair fight” in front of the Nebraska Supreme Court.
His office has alleged widespread fraud in the ballot measure campaign, which organizers have denied and a Lancaster County District Court judge widely rejected in November, after voters had weighed in.
The appeal from Hilgers’ office argues that because the district court judge found at least some signatures from four notaries that should not have been counted — not enough to disqualify the petitions — as grounds for the thousands of signatures collected by those notaries to lose a “presumption of innocence,” and require the campaign to “cure” those signatures.
None of the four targeted notaries have been criminally charged, Hilgers confirmed last week.
‘Take away this pain’: Families speak on proposed Nebraska medical cannabis regulations

Should any medical cannabis dispensaries be licensed, Hilgers’ office has planned to argue that the laws are preempted by the federal government, which continues to classify marijuana as a dangerous drug with no medical value. However, there have been steps under the Biden administration and now the Trump administration to reclassify the drug. Dozens of other states have implemented medical or recreational marijuana programs.
“I think two plus two is four, even if everyone else says two plus two is five,” Hilgers said last week.
LB 677 would also provide immunity to health care practitioners who recommend medical cannabis to patients. Under Current law, Hilgers has said he would consider such recommendations a potential “ethical violation” that could lead his office to investigate whether a recommending medical provider should lose a medical license.
The Nebraska Medical Association, in a written comment letter for LB 677 earlier this year, voiced support for the measure’s additional protections for medical providers.
New restrictions and guardrails
Securing the votes to get LB 677 out of the General Affairs Committee has required adding on a list of qualifying conditions, which excludes post-traumatic stress disorder, and prohibiting smoking as a permissible form of using medical cannabis.
Under the original ballot measure, a patient or their caregiver only needed to get sign-off from a health care provider to use medical cannabis in any form, including smoking.

While some senators and Hilgers argue smoking has never been a form of medicinal use, Nebraskans lined up one week ago to say that when they voted in November, they did so thinking all Nebraskans with a medical need could use cannabis in whatever form best worked for them. Some said they wouldn’t have voted for the ballot measures otherwise.
LB 677 would also amend the 5-ounce limit to state that no more than 2 ounces of that amount can be dried flower or bud, which could be manufactured into edibles, tinctures, ointments or other products. It would also add sales taxes to medical cannabis and direct tax revenue to property tax relief.
Hansen has told supporters that while PTSD, for instance, was left out as a “negotiating factor” to get the bill out of committee, the bill remains a “moving target.”
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, vice chair of the General Affairs Committee, has already filed amendments to add PTSD or to leave all conditions up to a patient and their physician.
“Medical cannabis is legal,” Cavanaugh said. “We need LB 677 to make it accessible and safe.”
Some Nebraskans have voiced concerns that leaving all regulations up to the Medical Cannabis Commission, as current law does, could lead to more restrictions than under LB 677. Part of the reason is that the governor’s two at-large appointments to the commission have opposed legislation concerning medical cannabis. One appointee opposed LB 677 at its March hearing.
Constitutional restraints
Why weren’t all guardrails considered or presented to voters in November? In part, because the Nebraska Constitution’s “single subject” requirement for ballot measures limits what could be presented to voters to begin with.

Ben Hansen of Blair, at right, speaks to attendees of a lawmaker-hosted public forum on medical cannabis at the University of Nebraska at Omaha on May 4, 2025, that he co-hosted with State Sens.

The ballot measures sought and created new state laws, rather than constitutional amendments, giving the Legislature the ability to amend the provisions with at least 33 votes, or a two-thirds majority. It was the third campaign in six years after numerous legislative bills stalled.
Some Nebraskans have also drawn connections between LB 677 and pending legislative efforts to water down voter-approved minimum wage increases and paid sick leave requirements.
Unlike those measures, medical cannabis supporters have partnered with Hansen.
Legislative strategy
However, the trade-off in going through the Legislature is the necessity of garnering at least 33 votes, which on this issue would likely require all 15 Democrats, one progressive nonpartisan and 17 Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.
The result would be stricter than at the ballot box, but supporters say it could be the best path forward for implementing the law.
Hansen and campaign officials have said LB 677 presents an “opportunity” to examine the medical cannabis programs in other states and create the best one for Nebraska.

Hansen, a Republican with a Libertarian bent, has told supporters to share their stories and photos, mostly with his Republican colleagues, to get 33 votes. He said he’s telling his colleagues to pass LB 677 and regulate medical cannabis, or the voters will end up legalizing recreational marijuana.
State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, a lead opponent to Hansen’s LB 677 who already views it as recreational, said he and others will prepare to fight the bill, if it is scheduled, to its max eight hours during first-round debate, which he said will be “very divisive” and “very tumultuous.” 
Lawmakers are running out of time as they are set to adjourn June 9.
At a recent public forum, Hansen said incremental progress is showing “the world hasn’t ended” before lawmakers can return and expand LB 677.
“We’re not going to eat 100% of the apple,” Hansen said. “We get 75%, 80%, make sure the people who need it, you get it.”

Jared Polis spoke alongside legislative leaders at a factory-built apartment complex in Denver on May 8, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature had a smaller emphasis on housing policy this year following the passage of splashy land use laws in 2024, but lawmakers still advanced quite a few bills related to housing, particularly for renters and first-time homebuyers.
Democrats enjoyed wide majorities in both the House of Representatives and Senate, and many of the bills passed this year had Democratic sponsorship and passed along party lines, though a few were bipartisan.
The 2025 regular legislative session ended on May 7, and Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, has until June 6 to take action on bills.

Receivership for shoddy apartments
Senate Bill 25-20 would allow third-party takeover of rundown apartment buildings that violate state laws around maintenance and habitability. The attorney general and municipal governments could petition the district court for a building to be put into receivership — during which a third party would manage and operate the property for a period of time — if the landlord demonstrates a “pattern of neglect,” including if the property lacks working ventilation, heating, lighting, or door locks, or has other health and safety hazards.
The receiver would be in charge of fixing the property’s issues and the landlord could seek to end the receivership after 90 days.
“We know there is a relationship between landlords and tenants. The landlord provides a property and the tenant pays for it,” bill sponsor Rep. Mandy Lindsay, an Aurora Democrat, said on the House floor during debate on the bill. “But in that agreement is that the property needs to be habitable.”
The bill was partially a response to a dilapidated building in Aurora owned by CBZ Management, which had longstanding safety problems and was closed by the city last year. The building also became a flashpoint in the debate over the Trump administration’s effort to conduct mass deportations.
“This bill gives tools to the attorney general and to cities and counties to be able to take care of situations where there is severe neglect,” Lindsay said.
The bill was sent to the governor on May 2.
Crack-down on rent price fixing
House Bill 25-1004 would ban the use, sale and distribution of software that uses an algorithm to set rents. That would include companies like RealPage, which is the subject of a lawsuit from Colorado and other states. Those companies use internal aggregate data from landlords around the area and then suggest rent prices based on the market. A study from the Biden administration last year found that units priced with RealPage software are about $136 more per month.
The bill passed both chambers on party-line votes, and progressive lawmakers and renters’ rights groups are urging Polis to sign it.
Reduced liability for condo construction
Lawmakers finally passed a bill related to construction defect lawsuits after multiple years of failed attempts. House Bill 25-1272 would give construction companies the choice to opt in to a program that would limit construction defect claims, which drive up project insurance costs and are said to be the reason condominium construction has plummeted in the state.
To participate in the program, builders would need to agree to inspections during the building process and provide a defect warranty to owners. The idea is that issues would be identified and addressed during construction and any errors discovered after someone moves in could be fixed quickly.
The bill was heavily amended to assuage some concerns from trial lawyers, home builders and homeowners.
Sponsors hope the bill will encourage builders to construct more condominiums, which are often more affordable options for first-time buyers priced out of the detached single-family home market.
“This is a problem that I believe we have a moral obligation to fix,” bill sponsor Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat, said during the bill’s debate in the House. “When you have the financial security that comes from owning your own home, you’re no longer at the whims of changing lease terms or increasing rents. We need to do better. Our state’s best answer cannot be more taxpayer-subsidized affordable housing. The market needs to work.”
The bill passed both chambers with widespread bipartisan support. It was sent to Polis on May 6 and it is almost certain he will sign it.
Boost for modular housing
The first bill Polis signed after the legislative session was Senate Bill 25-2, which concerns factory built, or modular, housing. Those structures are built in a factory to near completion and then transported to a building site. It is a faster method of construction with lower costs.
The state will set regional building codes for factory-built structures, eliminating some of the stickiest red tape for these types of builds.
“We thought one of the key housing bills that we passed provides streamlining and uniformity to make sure that this kind of housing can be built at lower cost and quicker across the state, so that we don’t have 600 different versions of modular housing. The big benefit is an economy of scale,” Polis said ahead of the bill signing Thursday.
Junk fees ban
Polis has also signed House Bill 25-1090, which requires disclosure of something’s final cost up front. That extends to rent costs, so starting in 2026 it will prohibit a landlord from not communicating to a prospective tenant extra costs on top of base rent for items like trash service, pest control and community amenity fees.
The total price would need to be advertised as one complete, accurate number, so a consumer knows what to expect to pay. Sometimes, those extra fees are revealed after a person pays an application fee or signs a lease.
These so-called “junk fees” will be deemed a deceptive practice and a person could bring legal action against a landlord who violates the law.
Earlier this year, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and federal regulators sued one of the state’s largest landlords, Greystar, over its use of junk fees.
“Hidden ‘junk fees’ often add up to hundreds of dollars in monthly expenses for Coloradans, and this new law cracks down on these surprise costs to save people money,” bill sponsor Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, said in a statement after the bill signing. “Whatever the ‘junk fee’ is disguised as, the goal is to hike up prices and drain money out of the pockets of hardworking Coloradans to increase corporate profits.”
Other housing bills passed this year include policies to allow some multifamily buildings to have just one staircase, ensure the return of security deposits to tenants in more circumstances and require building codes to follow accessibility standards.

Gabby Giffords on March 15, 2023. (Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks is joining the board of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which aims to elect Democrats to state legislatures across the country.
Brinks said in a statement that the DLCC’s work was instrumental to Michigan Democrats winning their first legislative trifecta in 40 years during the 2022 midterms.
“As the first Democrat to serve as majority leader in my chamber since the 1980s, I know firsthand what Democratic majorities can achieve here in Michigan and across the country as we continue to advocate on behalf of working families,” Brinks said.
Democrats lost their trifecta when Republicans took back the majority in the Michigan House last November. Brinks has since been in a legal battle with House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richmond Township), who has refused to pass along nine bills passed during the lame duck session but not transmitted to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for her signature.
Brinks said electing Democrats to state legislatures is important to stand up to the administration of President Donald Trump, vowing to “maintain a blue firewall in the states that will stand against this extremism.”
Brinks is one of seven Democratic state legislators added to the board Monday. Joining her are California Speaker Robert Rivas, Colorado Senate President James Coleman, Illinois Speaker Pro Tempore Kambium Buckner, Oregon Speaker Julie Fahey, Virginia Speaker Don Scott and Wisconsin Minority Leader Greta Neubauer.
DLCC Chair Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the majority leader and president pro tempore of the New York Senate, said in a statement that Brinks “embodies the diverse expertise needed to drive and elevate our strategy to build durable state power through the end of the decade,” calling her “battle-tested.”
“The stakes couldn’t be higher, but we have the team in place to meet this moment,” Stewart-Cousins said.

(Photo: John Partipilo)President Donald Trump’s administration has pulled the plug on roughly $37.7 million in federal funding across 42 grants for the University of Tennessee System.
The majority of the loss — $31.2 million — comes from eight terminated grants at the UT Institute of Agriculture. The institute houses the university’s agriculture research arm as well as its statewide educational organization providing resources to Tennessee farmers and communities in all 95 counties. It also houses the UT College of Veterinary Medicine and the Herbert College of Agriculture.
The UT school system was set to receive more than $59 million across 58 awards from multiple federal departments and agencies, according to records reviewed by Tennessee Lookout. The grant terminations apply to $51.4 million of that total, $37.7 million of which has not yet been spent.
UT’s Knoxville campus saw 25 awards terminated, representing a loss of a combined $2.1 million in funding. Other campuses impacted include:

UT Health Science Center: 4 terminated programs ($2.6 million)
UT Chattanooga: 4 terminated programs ($1.4 million)
UT Institute for Public Service: 1 terminated program ($419,107)

“The most immediate impact has been the need to transition students and staff supported by these affected projects to alternative funding sources,” spokesperson Melissa Tindell wrote in an email to Tennessee Lookout Friday. “Essential work such as reporting, compliance and other research operations continue with adjusted support.”
A total of 23 stop work orders have been rescinded system-wide, Tindell wrote. Nine partial stop work orders are in effect, “meaning that portions of the projects cannot be completed, though the total award amount hasn’t been impacted at this time.”
Ten grants remain active, and six are “pending.” 
Campuses with active grants include:

UT Knoxville: 4 active awards ($1.5 million)
UT Chattanooga: 2 active awards ($237,650)
UT Institute of Agriculture: 4 active awards ($1.5 million)

Awards pending further review include:

UT Knoxville: 3 awards ($1.2 million)
UT Health Science Center: 1 award ($82,000)
UT Martin: 1 award ($62,245)
UT Institute of Agriculture: 1 award (value unknown)

Of the several federal agencies that terminated funding to UT grants, the USDA reclaimed by far the most funds at $26.9 million.
Foreign aid freeze halts University of Tennessee international agriculture program

Federal records show one of the grants affected was a $30 million project funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture aiming to expand markets for climate-smart beef, dairy and small grazing animals across multiple states. The University of Tennessee sub-awarded $10.24 million to other universities for their roles in research meant to “support farmers’ and ranchers’ implementation and monitoring of climate-smart practices,” according to the grant summary on usaspending.gov.
Records maintained by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) indicate $30 million in “savings” from terminating the grant, but other federal records show $2.1 million already outlaid since the project started in September 2023. It’s not clear if the money spent was part of the project’s additional $6.2 million in non-federal funding. The project was supposed to conclude in September 2028.
The university’s Agricultural Leaders of Tomorrow (ALOFT) program, which sent volunteers to Southeast Asia to support agriculture education in developing countries, is another spending cut casualty. 
The program was awarded five years of funding under the U.S. Agency for International Development in 2023, but was put under a stop work order in February. The university’s webpage explaining the program now — now written in the past tense — shows its achievements from 2023 through 2025. University records show one terminated USAID program worth around $4.1 million.

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)This story was published in partnership with the Center for Media and Democracy, 
The more than $100 million spent on this spring’s Supreme Court election in Wisconsin set a new national record for spending on a state judicial race. The figure almost doubles the previous record of $51 million, which donors poured into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race in 2023. 
“The spending in this race is an indication of just how dominant state high courts have become in the biggest political fights playing out today,” Douglas Keith, a senior counsel in the Brennan Center’s Judiciary Program, told the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD). He pointed to the “growing recognition” of the significance of state courts in ruling on both challenges to election laws and abortion rights since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. 
The record spending on the 2025 Wisconsin race, the pathways the money traveled and the outsized influence of a few major donors raise questions about the future and fairness of judicial elections in Wisconsin and beyond. 
Outside spending 
The campaign for liberal candidate Susan Crawford — who ultimately won the election by 10 points — raised more than $28.3 million, while her conservative counterpart Brad Schimel pulled in over $15.1 million in campaign funding, according to a CMD analysis of Wisconsin Ethics Commission filings. 
Special interest and ideological political action committees (PACs) accounted for the majority of the spending, dropping almost $57 million on both the liberal and conservative candidates. Thirteen of those outside groups spent more than $1 million each (and in many cases, well over $1 million) on the race, for a total of $48.8 million — more than the combined total raised by the two campaigns. 

 
“Big money has ruined us,” Janine Geske, a retired Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, told CMD. “It distresses me. It just goes to the heart of the independence of the judiciary.” 
Several of the highest spending groups are linked to just a small number of individuals. Billionaire Charles Koch’s astroturf operation Americans for Prosperity spent more than $3.3 million, while shipping giant Richard Uihlein’s Fair Courts America super PAC spent over $4.4 million. 
Few backers drew more attention than Trump’s top campaign donor Elon Musk, who funneled nearly $18.7 million into the race to boost Schimel through his America PAC and the Building America’s Future PAC, a group he has reportedly funded in part since 2022.
“The Musk involvement helped politicize [and polarize] the race,” Charles Franklin, professor of law and director of the Marquette Law School Poll, told CMD. “That was a brand new element.” 
There was a strong turnout in the April election, with 51% of Wisconsin’s eligible voters casting ballots — remarkably high for an election in which the state Supreme Court was the highest office on the ballot. 
“Voter turnout is up because the race is important, but it’s also up because so much money is being poured into it,” Franklin said, noting a 15-year rise in turnout in the state’s elections for its highest court. 
Political party loophole 
Although Wisconsin Supreme Court elections are officially nonpartisan, the state’s Republican and Democratic parties played major roles. “It’s been so obviously a de facto partisan race for several cycles,” said Franklin, who also highlighted the significance of endorsements from President Trump and former President Obama in the election. 
The maximum amount that can be legally given to the campaign committee of a candidate running for the Wisconsin Supreme Court is $20,000. However, individuals can make unlimited contributions to a political party. Some donors use this as a legal loophole to funnel money to judicial candidates by first giving money to the state party, which then transfers the funds to the candidate’s campaign committee. 
In the most recent election, the Wisconsin Democratic Party gave more than $10.4 million to Crawford while the state GOP contributed over $9.5 million to Schimel, according to a CMD analysis of Wisconsin Ethics Commission filings. The contributions from the state parties accounted for almost two-thirds of Schimel’s overall campaign spending and more than a third of Crawford’s. 
The top donor to one of the two major political parties in Wisconsin is Diane Hendricks, who has given just under $3.6 million so far this year to the state GOP. She is the owner of Hendricks Holdings and a co-founder of ABC Roofing Supplies, the largest roofing supply company in the country. 

 
In addition to the $18.7 million Musk spent through PACs, he also gave $3 million to the Wisconsin GOP this year. Similarly, Richard Uihlein has given nearly $1.7 million to the
Wisconsin GOP in 2025 on top of the $4.4 million his PAC dropped on the race. His wife, Elizabeth Uihlein, gave more than $2.1 million to the state party. The couple each sent the maximum individual contribution of $20,000 to Schimel’s campaign as well. 
Major donations also flowed in on the Democratic side. Billionaire investor George Soros gave $2 million and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker gave $1.5 million to Wisconsin’s Democratic Party. 
Reform prospects 
The Marquette Law School Poll conducted in February found that 61% of respondents believe party contributions reduce the independence of judges. 
“It’s crucial that the public be able to look at courts and think they’re doing something different than raw politics,” Keith said. “This kind of an election makes it really hard for them to think of courts that way if the process for picking judges looks like the process for picking a U.S. senator.” 
Geske, who supports judicial elections in principle, shares that concern. “If there is no faith, we don’t have a system. It doesn’t work.” 
Yet, in that same poll, 90% of respondents said it was better to elect rather than appoint state Supreme Court justices. Wisconsin is one of 14 states that rely on nonpartisan elections to choose their Supreme Court justices, a practice it has followed since becoming a state in 1848. 
While the Marquette Law School Poll suggests there is broad public support for electing judges, record-breaking spending on those races raises concerns about judicial independence. 
The rising tide of outside spending is unlikely to recede, particularly given the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Citizens United v. FEC (2010) allowing unlimited outside spending on elections, including for judicial races. 
“Citizens United really set us back,” Geske said. “It destroyed the ability to have an independent judicial race where people can really look at the quality of the candidate versus the politics of it.” 
In 2017, she was one of 54 judges who petitioned the Wisconsin Supreme Court for stricter ethics rules to prevent judges from hearing cases involving major campaign contributors. But since the petition was ultimately rejected, no state rule currently requires a judge’s recusal or automatic disqualification from hearing such a case. The decision to recuse is left up to each individual justice in each case. 
The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009) held that a judge’s recusal is required when the campaign support received is so significant that it creates a “serious risk of actual bias,” but that standard has rarely been applied since the decision.
Geske had hoped that Wisconsin’s highest court would revisit the possibility of stricter ethics rules in this context but now thinks that is unlikely given the significant financial contributions several justices have received. She believes that stronger guidelines rather than requiring mandatory recusal may be a more viable option. 
Even if recusal guidelines were strengthened, Geske noted there would be practical complications if a Wisconsin Supreme Court justice stepped aside from a case. Unlike some other states, Wisconsin has no system for replacing a recused justice. If one of the seven justices steps aside, the court could be left with risking a deadlocked 3–3 decision. 
Beyond the question of independence, Keith said more could be done to enhance transparency in Wisconsin judicial elections overall, such as requiring more frequent financial disclosures. “While we know a lot about what groups were spending and how much they spent, we know very little about where their money was coming from,” he pointed out. “A lot of it is informed guesswork.” 
“The unprecedented and obscenely high amount of political money being raised and spent in Wisconsin Supreme Court elections is a fairly new and horrific development in our state,” wrote Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin, in 2024. “It wasn’t always this way here and it cannot and should not continue.” 
Heck pointed out that Wisconsin enacted the Impartial Justice Act in 2009, which provided public financing for state Supreme Court campaigns in exchange for a voluntary spending cap and a ban on soliciting private contributions. However, Republican Governor Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled legislature repealed the measure and dramatically weakened Wisconsin’s campaign finance laws. 
“We went from being the progressive good government promised land to the political wasteland of the country,” Heck said. 
Common Cause has called for updating and reinstating the 2009 reforms, along with strengthening recusal rules and prohibiting coordination between campaigns and outside groups. 
A recent poll by the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign found that almost three of four Wisconsin voters want limits on outside PACs, but that reform is not possible until the Citizens United decision is overturned. 
Next year’s Supreme Court election 
Major reforms are unlikely before the next election in April 2026, when conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley will be seeking to retain her seat. Spending will likely be lower than in this year’s race given that the court’s new 4–3 liberal majority will not be in play.
However, the scale and tone of the 2025 race may influence the 2026 election and others in different ways. Geske said she knows judges who would have previously considered running for the state Supreme Court but are no longer interested. 
“When you get into these kinds of numbers and that kind of race, they’re not going to put themselves and their families through it,” she said. “It narrows the number of people who are willing to run for the court.” 
Geske said that if judicial elections had been like this when she ran in 1993, she wouldn’t have run. “When I was running, we really tried to have bipartisan support,” she said. “Now it really is: ‘Whose side are you on?’” 
“I think that will continue and, as a result, I think that big money will continue to follow.”

Tennessee state Sen. Bo Watson wants to eject undocumented children from classrooms. But first, he needs their data.
Under legislation proposed in February, students statewide could be required to submit birth certificates or other sensitive documents to secure their seats — one of several state efforts this year designed to challenge a decades-old Supreme Court precedent enshrining students’ right to a free public education regardless of their immigration status.
Watson, a Republican, argues undocumented students are a financial drain on Tennessee’s public schools even though state officials don’t know how many are enrolled there. He sees a way to find out.
“If someone is not able to produce their documentation then you would make the assumption that they are here illegally and it would allow you to begin to collect some data as to the number of students in a school system that are either undocumented or are here illegally,” Watson said in an interview with The 74. “So that’s sort of a starting point for us, in terms of trying to understand what the financial cost is.”
The controversial legislation, which has drawn protests and could jeopardize more than $1.1 billion in federal money for Tennessee schools, has also sparked alarm among privacy advocates who warn efforts to compile data on students’ immigration status could be used not just to deny them an education — it could also fall into the hands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

As the Trump administration ramps up deportation efforts and tech billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency reportedly works to create a “master database” of government records to zero in on migrants, civil rights advocates warn that education data about immigrant students, such as home addresses, could be weaponized.
“That would be an easy grab for federal officials,” said Cody Venzke, a senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union focused on surveillance, privacy and technology. “Schools are a geographically based governmental service and that makes that data particularly vulnerable.”
Republican lawmakers in Tennessee, Oklahoma and Idaho seek to compel educators to collect records about students’ immigration status that have traditionally been outside their purview. Meanwhile, reams of existing information about immigrant students — including their birth locations and how long they’ve lived in the U.S. — could serve as proxies to help authorities identify and track undocumented students or those with undocumented family members, said Elizabeth Laird, the director of equity in civic technology at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology.

For Laird, a recent executive order signed by President Donald Trump to merge federal and state data, surveillance-driven immigration enforcement efforts and irregular data collection efforts across federal agencies set off alarm bells. Laird recently published a white paper on schools’ legal obligations to keep sensitive student data secure.
“What we’ve seen in the last three months is unprecedented access to and consolidation of data about people across a number of federal agencies, and that means taxpayers, it means student loan borrowers, it means Social Security recipients,” Laird said.
Immigration enforcement officials have already turned to data to deport international college students, unaccompanied minors who came to the U.S. without their parents and immigrant taxpayers whose IRS returns were once considered absolutely confidential. Additional irregular data collection efforts have been carried out across federal agencies in the name of rooting out fraud and waste.
“You don’t have to go very far to see the connection between the data environment that they’ve created in the name of fraud, waste and abuse and how it relates to immigration enforcement,” Laird said. As Republicans argue that immigrants are wrongly accessing benefits and causing financial turmoil in public schools, she said, “Immigration has become a fraud, waste and abuse issue.”
Officials at the White House and Education Department didn’t respond to requests for comment.

 Data collection in the surveillance age

At just over 100 days into Trump’s second term, there is no evidence that K-12 students’ data have become a specific target for immigration enforcement, even after ICE scrapped a longstanding policy this year that restricted agents from carrying out raids at schools, churches and other “sensitive locations.”
Watson told The 74 his legislation is about ejecting undocumented children from public schools and not about removing them from the country altogether. But a recent Center for Democracy and Technology survey suggests that educators even pre-Trump were already sharing student information with immigration enforcement officials. Some 17% of teachers reported that their schools provided student grades, attendance and discipline information to immigration authorities last school year, the survey found, as well as information collected by digital surveillance tools on school-issued laptops.

A recent executive order seeks to make vast data collection a lot easier. With a stated purpose of promoting government efficiency, Trump signed an executive order in March to eliminate “information silos” between federal agencies that have historically existed to prevent the government from abusing its access to Americans’ sensitive personal information, including adoption records, citizenship information, IP addresses and student loan histories.
Under the order, a whistleblower claims the Trump administration is building a database of individual people unlike anything the U.S. government has had before — and one that’s been compared to the tactics of authoritarian regimes.
“Most breathtaking,” Venzke said, is the Trump administration’s efforts to gain unfettered access to information held at state agencies. Experts said the broadly defined order could apply to schools, state education agencies and third-party contractors.
The U.S. Department of Education generally doesn’t maintain large datasets of student data beyond financial aid records — which include students’ and family members’ Social Security Numbers and Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers. Tax ID numbers are used by taxpayers without Social Security numbers to pay taxes regardless of their immigration status but could be leveraged as an indicator that someone is undocumented.
Will Filling Out Student Aid Form Target Undocumented Parents for Trump’s Mass Deportations?

The real student data trove, however, resides at the state level. In fact, states have maintained data about foreign-born students for years and the threat of immigration enforcement is “not limited to undocumented students,” according to the CDT white paper. More than 1,400 international college students in the U.S. lost their visas in the first months of the Trump administration, although it recently reversed those revocations in the face of court challenges.
State education data is used to populate the U.S. Department of Education’s EdFacts initiative, which centralizes state-by-state information to guide policy development and includes information about students who were born outside the U.S. and have been enrolled in U.S. schools for less than three years. Though the data states provide to the federal government is aggregated, Laird warned that local education agencies could be compelled to share the underlying records that identify specific students.
Schools also identify immigrant children and English learners in order to receive federal grants that support their learning. Additionally, under the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, which requires students nationwide to take standardized tests, immigrant students who have lived in the U.S. for less than a year can opt out of the English assessments — waivers the CDT noted “can only be provided if schools know who these students are.”

 Students cautioned against speaking out

Despite the recent executive order’s stated goal of preventing fraud, Laird said the mandate mirrors a 2019 executive order, issued during Trump’s first term, which sought to consolidate data for the explicit purpose of streamlining immigration enforcement. At least four states — South Dakota, South Carolina, Iowa and Nebraska — agreed to share driver’s license data with the Trump administration as it sought to pinpoint the citizenship statuses of every adult residing in the U.S.
Julie Sugarman, associate director for K-12 education research at the nonprofit Migration Policy Institute said educators nationwide have taken steps to ensure students’ records aren’t used beyond their intended purposes, including for immigration enforcement. But the Trump administration’s vast data collection efforts present an unprecedented situation.
“States generally would have a full spreadsheet that includes identifying information, so yeah, if the government was to go to states and ask for that, that would set off huge alarm bells,” Sugarman said.
“We’re in a time when the government is asking for things that they’ve never asked for before,” she continued. “So I’m really not sure what might happen if the government went to a state and said, ‘Give us your entire database with every piece of information about every student in public schools.’ “
Digital surveillance tools being used by federal immigration officials to track down deportation targets — including social media monitoring software — have become widespread in K-12 schools. Digital surveillance tools, which track students’ online communications and web searches, could offer valuable data to immigration officials, Laird said. In some instances, students’ digital communications are automatically shared with local law enforcement officers who, in communities nationwide, have been increasingly deputized to help enforce federal immigration laws.
Immigration Agents Inside Schools? Why Some Activists Are Warning Undocumented Students About Trump’s Policy Shifts

Social media surveillance tools used by K-12 schools and university educators have previously been leveraged to surveil student protests.
In the last few months, some K-12 students have already been warned to be careful about what they post on the internet as the government moved to revoked the visas of foreign-born college students for their participation in protests, social media posts and writing for college newspapers.
Martin Milne, president of the Connecticut-based Assist Scholars, said his organization has told international K-12 students that their ability to learn in the U.S. is conditional — and can be eliminated at a moment’s notice. The nonprofit scholarship organization currently helps nearly 200 international students enroll in U.S. private secondary schools.
“We’ve sent a really general reminder to students applying for visas to be particularly mindful that obtaining a student visa is really a privilege and it’s not a right and it comes with important responsibilities,” Milne said, echoing language recently used by the Trump administration. “And that if they abide by the responsibilities that come with being a visa holder, they’re not going to draw attention to themselves.”

 Tennessee wants Trump’s permission

Back in Tennessee, a Republican-led effort to collect data about undocumented students and bar their access to public schools has stalled. Despite claims that immigrant students are a drain on school resources, a state audit warned the move could cost Tennessee as much as $1.1 billion in federal education money if officials fail to comply with federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on race or national origin.
Still, the climate caused by the legislative effort and Trump’s deportation efforts has students on edge, Kyle Carrasco, a high school government and economics teacher in Chattanooga, told The 74. Although his school doesn’t ask students about their immigration status, Carrasco said he suspects at least some are undocumented and several have already had family members taken into ICE custody.

“At the end of the day, immigrants regardless of documentation status are paying taxes, they’re paying into the system that they — if these bills become law — will be withheld from,” Carrasco said. “So I don’t necessarily understand the reasoning and the logistics beyond why we need to be identifying and tracking these students.”
Watson, the state senator, hasn’t given up, telling The 74 he hopes his bill will resurface after local officials receive assurance they won’t be penalized by the federal government. In an April 21 letter to the U.S. Department of Education, state Fiscal Review Executive Director Bojan Savic asked if Tennessee risked losing federal money for its failure to comply with civil rights laws.
With Trump in charge, Watson said he didn’t think the letter was necessary.
“This bill, were it to be enacted into law, would align with the strategies that the current administration is exercising,” Watson said, “and it would not put our federal dollars in jeopardy.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-08-at-12.02.29 PM-1024x977.png,,,2025-05-12 06:05:11.979023

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)New York Magazine’s article airing concerns about Sen. John Fetterman’s alleged health struggles was the kind of story that shifted a news cycle — a rare feat in 2025, considering it had little or nothing to do with President Donald Trump.
The reporting, relying largely on ex-Fetterman staffers including his former chief of staff Adam Jentleson, painted a troubling picture. Since taking office, it alleged, Fetterman has displayed signs of paranoia, delusional thinking and erratic behavior, sometimes seeming unaware of his surroundings altogether. Jentleson said staff were concerned that he stopped following his doctors’ treatment plans following a stroke near the end of his 2022 Senate campaign and a subsequent hospitalization for clinical depression.
Fetterman strongly repudiated the article’s claims.
“New York Magazine decided to platform a grudge fashioned by best friends and disgruntled staffers unwilling to put their names on it,” Fetterman told the Capital-Star in an email. “If there were genuine concerns, they’d pick up the phone and call me, not the press. My actual doctors and my family affirmed that I’m in good health.”
A spokesperson for Fetterman added that the Pennsylvania Democrat has “always been fully transparent about the health issues that impacted his ability to work, and he will continue to be open should his circumstances ever change … He, his family, and his doctors have affirmed that he is in good health. Any anonymously sourced claims suggesting otherwise are untrue and to smear.” 
Since the article’s publication, other reports have emerged on Fetterman’s behavior. The Associated Press reported on a recent outburst at a meeting with union officials, and anonymous former staffers told the Inquirer that Fetterman has been “disengaged” from his duties as senator.
Fetterman has missed 18.9% of floor votes since taking office. That includes a number of votes during his six-week hospitalization for depression in 2023. According to the nonpartisan vote-tracker GovTrack, the median senator misses 2.7% of votes while in office.
“I’ve made roughly 90% of the votes since January,” Fetterman said in a statement sent to the Capital-Star. “The missed votes were overwhelmingly procedural, my vote was never determinative and limited to travel days.” 
The allegations about Fetterman surfaced as Democrats broadly have faced criticism for sweeping concerns about members’ fitness for office under the rug. Most prominently, the party was roiled after President Joe Biden’s disastrous 2024 debate performance appeared to confirm fears in the electorate that he was cognitively incapable of serving a second term. Biden ultimately stepped aside in the presidential race, though Fetterman remained one of his strongest defenders. 
That followed the 2023 death of then-Sen. Dianne Feinstein, at 90-years-old, who had been the subject of reports of diminishing cognitive capacity. More recently, House Democrats backed 75-year-old Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) over Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to serve as the top party member on the House Oversight Committee, despite concerns about his age and health. Connolly gave up the seat on the committee and said last month that he won’t seek reelection, citing a return of his esophageal cancer. The phenomenon hasn’t been limited to the Democratic side of the aisle. Republican congresswoman Kay Granger of Texas missed more than five months of votes last year while living in a memory care and assisted living facility.
‘Disgraceful smears’
Some prominent political figures have rushed to Fetterman’s defense, including Pennsylvania’s junior senator, Republican Dave McCormick. 
“It’s time to put politics aside and stop these vicious, personal attacks against Senator Fetterman, his wife, and his health,” McCormick wrote on social media Friday morning. “While we have many differences, we are both committed to working together to achieve results for the people of Pennsylvania and make their lives better. He is authentic, decent, principled, and a fighter. These disgraceful smears against him are not the John that I know and respect.”
A few elected officials from outside of the Keystone State from different sides of the aisle have also spoken out in support of Fetterman
“The only reason for the coordinated campaign against Senator John Fetterman is his unapologetic pro-Israel politics. Let’s call it what it is,” U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) wrote on social media Friday. “As someone who has struggled with depression my whole adult life, I can tell you that if you truly care about someone’s mental health, leaking hit pieces against them is a strange way of showing it.”
U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) also chimed in go to bat for Fetterman. 
“John Fetterman and I have our differences, but he’s a decent and genuine guy,” Cotton wrote. “The radical left is smearing him with dishonest, vicious attacks because he’s pro-Israel and they only want reliable anti-Israel politicians. Disgraceful.”
T.J. Rooney, a Democratic consultant and former chairman of the Pennsylvania state party, has spoken approvingly of Fetterman’s honesty about his health problems and iconoclastic political views.
“One of the ways he’s unique is he made all of his successes himself. Politics bent to him. John didn’t bend to the politics,” Rooney told the Capital-Star.
But he rejected the assertion by Fetterman and others that the reporting is part of an orchestrated attack. 
“I think people are reading a whole lot more into this than it’s deserving of,” Rooney said. “It’s just so f—–g sad. There are times in life when people find themselves in positions in life that they are not well suited to.”
For Fetterman’s first two years in the U.S. Senate, he served alongside Bob Casey. During Casey’s farewell address in December, Fetterman lauded Casey, who was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006, as a mentor and said that he was by his side when Fetterman had a stroke: “He lent me his voice when I was learning how to speak again. I never forgot that.”
When Fetterman was facing criticism from fellow Democrats earlier in Trump’s term for backing some of his cabinet selections, Casey defended him and called him a “very good senator” and said that he thinks he’d “do the right thing when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable and protecting the middle class.”

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that a memo from Jentleson noted that Fetterman’s relationships with colleagues began to suffer, including his “notable friendship” that “deteriorated” with Casey.
Casey told the Capital-Star Friday that “John and I have always had different styles and approaches to the job, but we had a strong relationship while I was in the Senate,” when asked about Fetterman’s fitness and current job performance. 
But some political insiders have called for his resignation, including Jonathan Last, the editor of the Bulwark who once saw Fetterman as a model for the future of the Democratic Party. Cumberland County Democratic Party chair Matt Roan also called for Fetterman’s resignation in an op-ed in March, before the New York Magazine report. The day that article was published, he reposted his own editorial and wrote, “I’ve been here for a month.”
Gov. Josh Shapiro has taken a more measured approach. 
“I think the best judge of Sen. Fetterman’s health is Sen. Fetterman and his family, and I’ll leave it to them to discuss that,” Shapiro said to reporters during a press conference in Philadelphia Thursday. 
When asked what he thought about Fetterman’s job performance, Shapiro said “again, I think it’s a question for Sen Fetterman and his family and the people of Pennsylvania to weigh in on.”
Gov. Tom Wolf and state Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia), who is chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, declined to comment.
Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) did not respond to questions sent to his press team by the Capital-Star.
‘A lot of noise’ 
Since taking office in 2023, Fetterman’s standing among Democrats in his own state has been rocky. 
Recent polling shows Fetterman still has support in the commonwealth, even improving marginally since he took office with around 50% approving of him compared to 35% disapproving in March. But a recent poll conducted before the New York Magazine story suggests that’s despite his support sinking among Democrats.
Though he ran as a progressive, Fetterman has since drawn ire from the left wing of his own party. Early opposition was over his staunch defense of Israel’s actions in Gaza. He was also the only Democrat to vote to confirm Attorney General Pam Bondi, who sidestepped questions about whether Trump lost the 2020 election during her confirmation hearings, and he criticized members of his party who wanted to force a government shutdown in March over opposition to federal cuts.
In February, just weeks into the Trump administration, he was denounced along with Trump and Elon Musk, leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, by speakers at a Pittsburgh protest organized by progressive activists. While protesters decried what they saw as executive overreach, and Fetterman’s failure to oppose it, the senator saw it differently.
“There isn’t a constitutional crisis, and all of these things ― it’s just a lot of noise,” Fetterman told HuffPost in February. “That’s why I’m only gonna swing on the strikes.”
Fetterman’s term in the Senate doesn’t end until 2029, and in politics nothing is certain. But questions about his fitness to serve could impact what will likely be an important race for both parties. Pennsylvania is one of only two states, along with Michigan, to have a Republican and Democratic senator, though a third, Maine, has a Republican and independent who caucuses with Democrats.

Roan told the Capital-Star he’s concerned Fetterman’s job performance will further dragging down voters’ confidence after what Roan called “feckless” opposition by congressional Democrats to Trump’s lawlessness.
“A lot of the public isn’t so hot on Democrats right now, so we need people in those slots who can mount a more effective response to Trump’s abuses,” Roan said. 
Having led the local effort to turn out voters for Fetterman in 2022, Roan said Fetterman’s term so far has been a disappointment that he fears could erode support for Democrats in down-ballot races.
“Every time our elected officials let us down it negatively affects our donors and their support,” Roan said.
Since the start of his Senate campaign, Fetterman has been a fundraising juggernaut. However, in the first three months of 2025, his campaign raised just over $395,000, which was the lowest amount in a full quarter since he declared for the seat in February 2021.
While a sitting senator in the middle of his term isn’t a priority for donors, Roan said, it could signal doubt about Fetterman’s viability as a candidate going forward.
Rooney, the Democratic consultant, wouldn’t weigh in on calls for Fetterman’s resignation, but said his next campaign should be secondary to his wellbeing.
“Does he have a future in elected office? I don’t know, but that’s not what’s important right now,” he said. “We just want the guy to get some help. He’s got a great family, a wife who obviously cares a lot about him, kids who adore him.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2200949176-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 06:05:11.979023

Guthrie, R-Bowling Green, is chairman of a House committee that on Tuesday is set to start proposing $880 billion in federal budget savings over the next 10 years. Guthrie’s assignment will be impossible, experts say, without cutting the federal-state program that pays for almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care.
“Medicaid has become important to local economies throughout the state and a key pathway to health care for many Kentuckians,” says the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce in a statement last week that also mentions the Chamber’s “long voiced concerns about the impact of rising Medicaid costs on Kentucky’s finances.” 
“Efforts to control Medicaid spending will be necessary,” says the pro-business group whose top recent priority has been continuing to lower Kentucky’s income tax. “Policymakers, however, will need to take a balanced approach with input from key stakeholders.”
Guthrie, a West Point graduate and former state legislator, is not publicly discussing specifics ahead of the markup, a spokesperson for the committee said Friday. 
“Chairman Guthrie and Energy and Commerce Republicans are ready to strengthen, secure, and sustain Medicaid for generations to come and for the Americans the program was intended to serve,” said Matt VanHyfte, the director of communications for the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
Sounding a common GOP theme, he said Medicaid was intended “to assist the ‘traditional population’ which are expectant mothers, children, low-income seniors, and people with disabilities.”

Medicaid was expanded beyond that traditional role in 2010 when Congress — with no Republican votes — enacted the Affordable Care Act, a law that became known as Obamacare.
By then the number of uninsured had topped 46 million, nearing 1 in 5 Americans; medical bills were increasingly pushing sick people into bankruptcy as hospitals shifted costs onto the dwindling share of insured patients.

Under the Medicaid expansion, the federal government offered to pay 100% of the costs for state Medicaid programs to begin covering low-income, able-bodied adults who can’t afford or who lack access to private health insurance. 
‘Salvation for small rural hospitals’
Kentucky, a poor state with lots of sick people, has aggressively embraced the new option, and that has “changed the dynamics considerably,” says Mark Birdwhistell, an expert on Medicaid and the University of Kentucky’s senior vice president for health and public policy. 
The Medicaid expansion has been “a great benefit to the health care delivery system at the University of Kentucky and all over Kentucky, particularly Southeastern Kentucky,” Birdwhistell told the Lantern. “It’s been a salvation for small rural hospitals in Eastern Kentucky and good for health outcomes as well,” Birdwhistell said.
The rate of uninsured Kentuckians fell from 14.4% in 2013 to 6.1%  in 2015, the year after the Medicaid expansion took effect. In 2023, 5.6% of Kentuckians’ were uninsured compared to 8% of the U.S. population.
Birdwhistell has been spending a lot of time in Washington sharing his knowledge with Kentucky’s congressional delegation and with staff of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which oversees Medicaid, Medicare and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

In an interview with the Lantern, Birdwhistell discussed some of the Medicaid proposals the Republicans who control Congress are considering as they look for savings to pay for continuing tax cuts enacted in 2017 during President Donald Trump’s first term. 
Lowering federal share would be $1.4 billion hit to Kentucky
The proposal that would be the “most problematic” for Kentucky, Birdwhistell said, is one to lower the matching funds the federal government pays for the Medicaid expansion. After paying 100% of the expansion for a few years, the federal match was lowered to 90%, leaving states to pick up 10% of the expansion cost.
By contrast, the federal government picks up 71% of the cost of insuring Kentucky’s traditional Medicaid population. (Kentucky receives a higher federal match than most states because it’s based on a state’s per capita income and Kentucky’s is comparatively low.)  Of Kentucky’s $19 billion Medicaid budget, almost $15 billion comes from the federal government and about $4 billion from state sources.
If Congress decides to lower the expansion match to the lower share for the rest of the program, Kentucky would have to provide an additional $1.4 billion to continue covering the almost 500,000 people in the expansion, according to an estimate by the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services. “It would be difficult for the General Assembly to come up with that amount of money,” said Birdwhistell.
Birdwhistell said he understands why some members of Congress question the more generous federal match for the Medicaid expansion, but said, “In Kentucky, in my opinion, the benefits outweigh the downside.”
Block granting Medicaid would threaten traditional population
Another option being floated would impose per capita caps on federal funding for Medicaid, in essence a block grant based on the size of the covered population, which Birdwhistell said would likely cause negative impacts for the traditional Medicaid population especially the disabled and frail elderly, new mothers and babies who need neonatal intensive care.
Under a cap, some patients could be denied care if their costs exceeded a designated amount, he said, making it difficult to administer and producing “negative policy outcomes.”
If a per capita cap is the Republicans’ chosen alternative, Birdwhistell said it would be better to apply it to the expansion population who are healthier, younger and cheaper to insure.
Among the almost 1 million Kentuckians covered by traditional Medicaid is Caden Plemons, 19, of Bowling Green. He has Down Syndrome and autism and is “primarily nonverbal,” says his mother Rheanna Plemons who worries lawmakers will subject Medicaid to “broad, sweeping cuts, without doing any research to ensure that it’s not decreasing the standard of care for individuals with intellectual disabilities.”

Caden also receives services through Kentucky Medicaid’s Michell P. waiver, which helps people who have intellectual disabilities live more independently. Caden’s community living supports include  staff to help him with daily tasks like dressing and going to appointments and getting out to enjoy go carts and other activities. 
“He’s thriving in the community because of the services that we have received over the last 19 years,” Plemons said. 
Caden’s waiver also covers respite care so Plemons and her husband can “take a break every now and then.” 
“Sometimes people don’t realize: if you have a child who has a severe disability, such as my child, that’s 24 hours a day care, seven days a week,” Plemons said. “I work. My husband works full time. So if we want to take a break, even to go out to have dinner with just the two of us, then somebody’s got to be there with Caden, even though he’s 19 years old.” 
Work requirement expands bureaucracy
Another option under consideration for trimming Medicaid costs is a work requirement. Birdwhistell estimates that more than half of able-bodied Kentuckians covered by Medicaid — the working poor — already hold low-wage jobs. The income limit for most working-age adults to qualify for Medicaid is 138% of the federal poverty level. That works out to $44,367 a year for a family of four which “in some areas of the state is quite a few people,” said Birdwhistell.
Enforcing a Medicaid work requirement would require funding an expanded bureaucracy to keep up with new reporting demands and insure compliance, Birdwhistell said. 
The Republican-dominated Kentucky legislature this year enacted a Medicaid work requirement that will be up to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration to bring online.

Critics view work requirements as a smokescreen for using red tape to push people off the Medicaid rolls. 
Megan Rorex, a licensed clinical social worker and therapist in Bowling Green, predicts new reporting demands would snag her Medicaid-covered clients. Many of them work multiple part-time jobs, often in the restaurant industry, and would lack the time or bandwidth to keep up with an additional layer of paperwork in a program that she considers already overcomplicated. “Any bureaucratic policy that’s unnecessary is a problem to navigate if you’re already working multiple jobs. It adds another layer of stigma and stress,” she said.
Provider taxes and state directed payments
Some Republicans, including Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget and an author of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 agenda for the second Trump administration, want to limit states’ use of levies on health care providers — called provider taxes —  to leverage higher Medicaid funding from the federal government. 
Kentucky levies a number of provider taxes that bring additional federal Medicaid funds into the state and pay for state directed payments that increase hospitals’ Medicaid compensation to levels that on average are what private insurers would pay for the same services. Directed payments bring $5.5 billion a year to Kentuck providers, most of it from the federal government.
So far, congressional discussion has focused on capping provider taxes at 5% of hospital patient revenue which would not affect Kentucky because provider tax rates here are below 5%, Birdwhistell said.
Kentucky is using these payments to incentivize quality improvements, such as more frequent well-child visits and screenings for disease. Hospitals must meet the quality objectives to qualify for the extra funding, which Birdwhistell says has been “extremely successful” in transforming UK Healthcare into a “value-based organization.” He said he’s advising federal officials that Kentucky’s use of provider taxes to improve quality are models worth replicating in other states.
Slow return on investment
A complaint voiced by some Republican state lawmakers during this year’s session in Frankfort is that Medicaid spending increases each year —  almost $2.6 billion budgeted from Kentucky’s General Fund in fiscal year 2024 — without producing improvements in health outcomes
Birdwhistell said it takes a long time to realize the return on investment in health care. “These are generational issues. It takes a person’s lifetime before you can say what the savings were.”
And Kentuckians are inching out of the nation’s basement on some health indicators.
In 2024, Kentucky advanced to 41st among the 50 states — up from 45th in 2016-2021 — in America’s Health Rankings, an annual study by the United Healthcare Foundation based on a variety of health, behavioral and socioeconomic metrics. 
On the upside, 

The rate of colorectal screenings in Kentucky rose from 20th nationally in 2022 to 10th in 2024.
Kentucky’s obesity rank improved from 48th in 2022 to 40th in 2023. 
And Kentucky’s drug-related deaths declined from 47th highest among the states in 2022 to 45th in 2024.  

Kentucky ranked 16th nationally in availability of primary care providers last year, down from 11th in 2023.
The study also identifies plenty of room for improvement. Kentucky ranked 49th for adults with multiple chronic conditions in 2023 and 45th for percentage of households experiencing food insecurity in 2024.
The politics 
While Guthrie’s role in potential Medicaid cuts is not expected to hurt his chances next year for reelection to a 10th term, Republicans representing swing districts in Congress could face a voter backlash, and some are refusing to vote for Medicaid rollbacks pushed by more conservative colleagues. Republicans’ narrow margin in the House means even a few defectors could doom budget provisions, while a few midterm defeats next year could give Democrats control of the chamber.
Candidate Trump promised to protect Medicaid, and the White House reiterated that promise in March, but  Trump also is urging Congress to enact the House budget blueprint that he  calls the  “big beautiful bill” — goals that appear to be in conflict.
Guthrie will be a “key player,” says Birdwhistell, as his committee works this week to move the House budget proposal closer to a vote by the full House. 
  Tres Watson
Tres Watson, a former spokesperson for the Republican Party of Kentucky, echoed the talking point  that Guthrie and many Republicans  are working to return Medicaid to its original, pre-Affordable Care Act, “reining in what many Republicans view as out of control entitlement spending, getting away from what was originally intended to be … a trampoline, not a mattress,” Watson said. 
Kentucky’s top Democrat, Gov. Andy Beshear, has joined Democratic governors in calling on Congress to protect Medicaid funding. In a Democratic Governors Association press call last week, Beshear, the group’s vice chair, told reporters that “gutting Medicaid would impact families in a substantial way.” He said half of Kentucky children and 70% of long-term care costs in Kentucky are covered by Medicaid. 
“Massive cuts to Medicaid is an attack on rural America, and if they do it, these Republican representatives and senators are saying they don’t believe that the people of rural America deserve the same access to health care as those in urban America,” Beshear said. “Certainly it would devastate my state, but it would devastate so many of our communities in every single state across the United States.”
‘The only system in the world like it’
  Ben Chandler (Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky photo)
The fate of rural hospitals is bound to weigh on Republicans who were sent to Washington from red states. Even if hospitals are not forced to close, Medicaid cuts could force hospitals to lose services, says Ben Chandler, who retired last year as president and CEO of the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky. Before that he was Kentucky attorney general and auditor and represented the state’s 6th Congressional District from 2004 to 2013.
For Chandler the debate highlights the need for broad reform that would move the U.S. away from relying on employers to provide health coverage through a for-profit insurance industry that wields enormous influence on Capitol Hill.
“It’s ridiculous we don’t have Medicare for all or whatever you want to call it,” said Chandler who voted against the Affordable Care Act in 2010 because a proposal for a government-run “public option” health insurance plan was removed from the bill as a concession to the insurance industry and its supporters.
Chandler called the U.S. system “accidental,” born of World War II wage caps that inspired employers to compete for workers by offering a hospitalization benefit.
The U.S. spends twice as much on health care per capita as other large, wealthy nations while U.S. health outcomes are far worse than those in other nations. 
Says Chandler, “It’s the only system in the world like it.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The indefinite suspension of 20 degree programs and concentrations at Rhode Island College (RIC) — including Portuguese, art history, and Latin American studies — surprised some people on campus. 
But the low enrollment in those programs was obvious, according to an April 16 email to the campus community by RIC President Jack Warner.
“I understand that change of this kind is often a source of trepidation,” Warner wrote. “I can’t emphasize enough that this work should be a regular part of our housekeeping processes; it only seems new and novel because it has not been done for so long.”
Warner’s email linked to a 32-page report conducted by the RIC Provost’s Productivity and Efficiency team to comply with statewide policy for academic program review. The Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner (OPC) oversees public higher ed in Rhode Island and mandates that schools review their offerings “no less frequently than every six years.” 
But such an exhaustive program review is “something we have not done in many years,” Warner wrote.
Students in affected programs can complete their studies, and courses and minors in the affected topics will still be offered, Warner said. But when the new academic year starts in the fall, no new students can enroll as majors in these programs — a process known as “teach-out.” The majority of the affected RIC programs have awarded fewer than five degrees in each year since 2021. Neither Francophone studies or respiratory therapy, for instance, have awarded a baccalaureate degree since 2021.    
Under statewide policy, programs that haven’t awarded at least 11 associate or bachelor’s degrees, six master’s, or four doctorates over a three-year period are subject to elimination, merging with other programs, or continued review. The RIC report recommended consolidating 15 programs and shuttering the 20 others.
Warner said the curricular spring cleaning is not expected to impact faculty positions, and that the move “was not an immediate cost-cutting measure.”
Students hold protests
Postsecondary Education Commissioner Shannon Gilkey said in an emailed statement that the program review process is “consistent with practices among colleges and universities across the U.S.”
Best practice or not, the maneuver left some RIC faculty and students flabbergasted with some claiming the process was performed less transparently than Warner suggested. Dozens of students held a “Save Our Majors” protest at the Rhode Island State House on April 24.
“Why can’t we have a say about what majors get shut down?” Hak Kay, a gender studies and film major said at the protest as quoted in RIC’s student newspaper, The Anchor.
Rhode Island College students protested at the State House on April 24 — the same day that had been slated for a celebration of RIC Day at the State House, until the event was canceled out of respect for the death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio on April 21.
Still, the Rhode Island Senate praised RIC in a resolution passed May 6, one led by its freshly elected President Valarie Lawson, also a RIC alum. The resolution stated RIC was “on the cutting edge of programs in cybersecurity, biotechnology, data science and artificial intelligence.”

Vincent Bohlinger, a RIC film studies professor, said in an interview the process was inconsistent with the college’s internal policies. Bohlinger’s program survived the efficiency study for now, as did 21 other underenrolled programs included in the provost’s report but spared from discontinuation or consolidation. 
All programs of study included in the report began filling out reviews in January after being identified as underenrolled, according to RIC’s website. Faculty members who needed to fill out information for their programs’ reviews had some troubles with the process, Bohlinger claimed.
“It was really like building a plane while it’s on the runway,” Bohlinger said. “The templates were changed, data was updated, they changed the deadlines, they moved them back, and then they moved it up for some people. It was really chaotic. …When the end game is actually suspending programs and reducing the options that students have for academic study and for career paths, it seems like process becomes more crucial than ever.” 
Bohlinger objected to the timing of the report’s release in spring, when students are deciding which colleges to attend.
“RIC is cutting 20 programs. That’s the headline,” he said.  
Dante DiGregorio, a junior majoring in political science, thought the school should redo the evaluations of low-enrolled classes and, like Bohlinger, claimed RIC did not follow either internal rules or the specifics of the OPC review policy. 
“I think they should either suspend it or redo it, because they want to do this every year, and if this is how they did the first time, how will they do it the next time?” DiGregorio said. “Procedurally, it was just awful.”
DiGregorio’s comments came after an April 29 State House press conference hosted by Rep. Karen Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat and member of the Rhode Island Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian-American and Pacific Islander (RIBLIA) Caucus. 
Alzate, a 2013 RIC graduate, took to Room 135 of the State House to decry the cuts and noted that RIC is the first federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution in Rhode Island. Evaporating programs like foreign languages doesn’t make sense, she said, especially in the current political climate.
“How are we making ourselves competitive when we’re getting rid of something that is so important right now because of what’s happening with the federal administration?” Alzate said after the presser.
Alzate couldn’t argue against the low enrollment, but she questioned if any outreach efforts were initiated to connect with potential students. “What were you doing in order to get students to come to RIC who will major in these things?” she said.
Were low enrollment programs ignored while cybersecurity promoted?
Alzate had several allies in the audience, including Rep. June Speakman, a Warren Democrat. In a phone interview, Speakman said her solidarity with Alzate derived partially from her own experiences as a political science professor at Roger Williams University in Bristol, where the school conducted a similar program review in 2023 that identified underenrollment in programs flagged for potential phaseout. (Full disclosure: This reporter previously worked at the same university during the time of the program review.)
Smaller, private colleges like Roger Williams University are more likely to lack the resources to sustain less popular offerings in the humanities or liberal arts, especially in recent years. The post-COVID era saw enrollment patterns slide downward by 10% from 2012 to 2022 — a reduction of about two million students nationwide.

Humanities often bear the brunt of the cuts at state-funded colleges and universities too. 2023 data from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences showed that humanities graduates make up a small chunk of the nationwide workforce, ranging from 1.9% in Mississippi to 8.3% in Vermont. Rhode Island had 5.8% of full-time workers holding humanities degrees.
The interaction of economic constraints and student demand were not lost on Speakman, who sits on the New England Board of Higher Education. She understands how intense fiscal pressure can influence administrative decisions to cut courses. A hypothetical philosophy classroom with only three students in it, Speakman said, doesn’t satisfy the idea of healthy enrollment. 
Speakman said the challenges facing the arts and humanities at the college level echo what’s happening in elementary and secondary schools.
“Those programs have been under assault in schools for years…I don’t want to sound overly mushy about it, but these disciplines — art, music, philosophy, literature — they make us fully human.”
Speakman said the General Assembly mostly gets involved in public funding to K-12 schools, but she acknowledged one area of higher ed where the state has invested significantly: cybersecurity, with RIC at its epicenter via a $73 million share of a $160.5 million bond voters approved last November. 
“My concern is that these are going to become the province of the wealthy again, as they were in the middle ages, where you had wealthy people being able to study literature and art…and the rest of us…we were apprentices at the blacksmith,” Speakman said. “That’s kind of a ridiculous example, but…all of us, no matter what our paying job is, should have access to those areas of study.”
Brighter enrollment outlook for some, but not all, programs
RIC has started to reverse its enrollment decline, Warner shared in his recap of the college’s past year at a March 25 hearing before the Senate Committee on Finance. New, high-demand programs introduced since 2023, like cybersecurity, sports management and biotechnology, are seeing healthy demand, the president said.
Warner foreshadowed the forthcoming announcement of cuts after a long process in which “it was an important priority for us for any program affected to be heard.”
Higher education, Warner said, is “a mature industry, not just growing and growing and growing. So if you’re going to put new programs into place, you have to make room for those by constantly evaluating the programs that might no longer be serving in ways that they were originally intended.”
The Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI), had slightly different results when it reviewed its programs. Between 2020 and 2023, it removed from its catalog 18 mostly technology-related offerings, many of them certificate programs, in which enrollment declined or the curriculum no longer aligned with today’s job market. 
But CCRI also replaced the defunct programs with new offerings, like certificates for cyber defense and graphic design, or an associate’s degree in cloud computing.
“Each change is the result of thorough academic and industry review and reflects our continuous efforts to offer programs that lead to meaningful careers for our students,” Amy Kempe, chief of staff at CCRI, said in an email. “And, we actually came out a net positive one program!”



What programs were recommended for suspension at RIC?
The following 20 programs, some of which are concentrations offered under the umbrella of other degree programs, were marked for suspension in the Productivity and Efficiency report. Numbers from RIC show the number of people who obtained a degree from the program in 2024. In fall 2024, RIC had a total full-time enrollment of 5,420 students, both graduate and undergraduate.

(Getty Images)With the goal of supporting working families, state lawmakers this session passed a new tax credit that subsidizes child care for North Dakota businesses.
Senate Bill 2282 applies specifically to child care stipends. The tax credit allows employers that offer this benefit to write off 50% of their child care contributions off their income taxes. Businesses can claim up to $1,000 in child care subsidies per employee toward this total.
Andrea Pfennig, vice president of government affairs for the Greater North Dakota Chamber, called the tax credit a “step in the right direction.”
In written testimony submitted in favor of the bill, Pfennig said in a 2024 survey of chamber members nearly 70% of respondents saw child care as an issue.
Some feel the tax credit doesn’t do enough. North Dakota Human Rights Coalition Executive Director Dalton Erickson said it will leave out many North Dakota families.
“A modest tax credit was passed, but it only applies to businesses that offer child care stipends, a luxury workplace benefit that the majority of workers don’t receive,” Erickson said at a Thursday morning event outside the Capitol.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong signed the bill into law May 1. Businesses can start using the credit for their 2025 taxes.
Pfennig called the new tax credit an improvement over a previous child care program passed by the Legislature in 2023.
Under that program, businesses can apply for a state match for either $300 a month or $150 a month for child care subsidies.
Some businesses found the matching program bureaucratically complex as well as limited in scope, Pfennig said. It is also only available for kids ages 5 and under, and has income limits, according to the program’s website.
Pfennig said she’s glad that both programs are still an option for businesses so that they can choose what’s best for them.
The Legislature this session also passed House Bill 1119, which directs the Department of Health and Human Services to form a child care services advisory committee to study child care licensing.
The bill also invites Legislative Council to conduct a program evaluation of the Department of the Health and Human Services’ child care services.

Republican leaders in the House have scheduled committee hearings for this week, with floor debate on the chamber’s budget tentatively set for next week.
Despite the upper chamber’s bill awaiting action, the House GOP leaders will almost certainly begin their own plan from scratch. The two chambers have only agreed to the top-line spending amount — everything else is negotiable. And before a final version heads to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk, budget writers from both chambers will meet to iron out a compromise.
“(The budget chairs) have been working on it, and it’s gone smoothly so far, at least in talks with the Senate,” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) told reporters last week. “Of course, we’ve only talked about the high level things.”
Lawmakers are expected to deliver a budget to Stein’s desk by June 30, the end of the fiscal year. But they have frequently gone beyond that date due to extended negotiations.
Senate Republicans’ budget lays out $36.2 billion in spending for the next year. It cuts hundreds of vacant state government positions, and some filled ones. It keeps in place a series of gradual GOP-led income tax cuts. And it includes modest raises for public sector workers, including teachers, law enforcement and state government employees.



Publicly available details of what the House plan will include are scant. But Hall has been clear that he expects the chamber’s budget to include larger pay raises than both the Senate’s bill and the Democratic governor’s request.
“I think you’ll see raises that are more than Stein proposed,” he said.
Under the Senate proposal, educators will receive an average 3.3% raise over the next two years. State employees would get a 1.25% raise and a $3,000 bonus. Law enforcement raises would be more substantial, such as a 5.25% raise for correctional officers and the State Bureau of Investigation.
The State Employees’ Association of North Carolina has expressed displeasure with both Stein’s and the Senate’s proposals, calling for better raises and decrying the Senate’s cuts to the state workforce.
House Republicans could also diverge from the Senate’s doubling down on income tax cuts. Hall has left the door open for adjusting the existing rates, or “dialing the knobs.” But he’s ruled out any tax increases.
The Republican Senate leader, President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), has been steadfast in his support for the cuts.
Democrats, meanwhile, have urged the GOP to hit pause on the cuts — pointing to state economists’ projection that a budget shortfall could be on the horizon.
Leaders of the minority party have expressed broader frustration with the budget process, saying they’ve been granted almost no input. And they remain dubious about Republicans’ confidence to finish negotiations by the end of June.
“I think it is very ambitious, and I think frankly hilarious, that they will get a budget by June 28,” Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) told reporters last week.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9532-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 06:05:11.979023

(Photo by Evan Visconti for the Virginia Mercury)Virginia fishery managers and others from Maine to North Carolina, as well as members of the public, convened on Tuesday to decide the next steps to protect the future of Atlantic striped bass, a valued and remarkable animal facing consecutive years of low spawning success and an overfished stock. 
Atlantic striped bass have been referred to as “everyman’s fish” because they are caught by such a wide population of anglers up and down the coast, said Alex McCrickard, the aquatic education coordinator for the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources. 
Their native range in Virginia spans from the freshwater spawning grounds of inland, tidal rivers like the Rappahannock, York and James to the salty, ocean waters off the Eastern seaboard. 
Regulations for Virginia’s coastal, migratory striped bass stock are managed by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission in conjunction with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC), who manages interstate fishery regulations for the stock between Maine and North Carolina. 
Anglers can utilize a wide range of gear types and techniques to catch striped bass. Some target the fish for the excitement of catch and release, while others seek them out to harvest as a culinary staple. 
As a resource, striped bass make up one of the “most valuable recreational fisheries on the Atlantic Coast,” said Emilie Franke, a fishery management plan coordinator for ASMFC. “I think one of the really unique things about it is that the fisheries really vary from state to state.”
“The Chesapeake Bay is as important to the striped bass and its successful life history” as the fish are to the coastal communities and economies of the region, said Allison Colden, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s executive director for Maryland. 
Striped bass rely on the tributaries and tidal estuaries of the Chesapeake Bay as a “foundational nursery ground” for the first few years of their lives, said Tom Dunlap, the riverkeeper for the James River Association. “As a top predator in the Bay ecosystem, (striped bass) are important for their relationships with all of our other species as well.”
An estimated 70% to 90% of all of the striped bass that make it into that coastal migratory stock start their lives in the Chesapeake Bay and its estuaries.
 An unpredictable future

Climate change is a major factor contributing to the decline of striped bass, and it is one that is much harder to control than the overfishing that was uncovered by researchers in 2019. 
Striped bass prefer cool, wet winters and springs, and as those conditions become less common as a result of climate change, “the probability that we are going to hit the lotto with the right combination of environmental conditions is becoming lower and more rare,” said Colden.
Wet springs produce high discharge volumes throughout the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay, which expands the habitat available for striped bass to spawn in, said Martin Gary, director of the Division of Marine Resources at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. 
At the same time, those rains flush nutrients into the rivers that are necessary for zooplankton to successfully bloom, a critical food source for striped bass after hatching, Gary said.
If zooplankton are not successful, or if the timing is off between their bloom and the striped bass spawning runs, fewer fish will survive to bolster the future spawning population. 
The concern today, Gary said, is that if we continue seeing consecutive, poor young-of-year classes, what will the stock biomass look like over the next decade? 
“We’ve got a double edged sword where we’re not getting very good recruitment because of environmental factors, and the spawning stock biomass is low too,” said Pat Geer, chief of fisheries management for the Virginia Marine Resources Commission.
Virginia has seen two consecutive years of historically low numbers of juvenile striped bass surveys, while Maryland has witnessed six consecutive years of low numbers. The data is compiled in a yearly stock assessment to give managers a sense of the reproductive success and early survival rate of the fish.

Below average juvenile stocks mean that “once the adults that are currently in the population start to either be harvested or die out, there are very few young fish growing up to replace them,” said Colden. 
“It’s going to take a long time to rebuild a population like striped bass that doesn’t mature until five to seven years of age,” said Geer. But building up the spawning stock biomass is “something we can control overtime.”
Gary said in the past, striped bass proved to be resilient, fortuitously, and bounced back after a moratorium was placed on the fishery in the 1980s due to fears of losing the species to extinction. Within ten years after the moratorium was put in place, striped bass were declared recovered up and down the coast.
Although Gary said the adult striped bass stocks are in much better shape today now than they were in the 1980s, managers cannot depend on the recovery witnessed in the early 1990s now that a new set of challenges exists, “especially in the face of climate change and the impacts of rapidly warming waters and changing marine and estuarine ecosystems.”
 Changes to fishery regulations 

New regulations were put in place last year by the Atlantic Striped Bass Management Board, which oversees interstate striped bass management for ASMFC, to establish a consistent size and bag limit throughout the Chesapeake Bay portion of the fishery.
Fishing seasons, on the other hand, are not consistent throughout the Bay, with management divided between multiple jurisdictions including Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission. 
Outside of shortening the fishing seasons, managers are “really running out of options,” said Geer. Virginia already has a “pretty conservative” recreational harvest season of only about 100 days, one of the shortest on the East coast, he said. 
  Considered “everyman’s fish,” striped bass are available to a wide range of anglers, from surf casters on secluded beaches to shoreline anglers and charter boat captains operating out of urban cities like Richmond. (Photo by Evan Visconti for the Virginia Mercury)
Currently, “no-target” closures for striped bass don’t exist in Virginia, meaning it is legal all year for recreational anglers to target the fish for catch and release. Virginia fishery managers are not proposing to add any additional regulations outside of what could be agreed upon this year by ASMFC, said Geer. 
Maryland Department of Natural Resources, meanwhile, proposed a new layout for its 2026 fishing seasons to the board on Tuesday that includes a no-target closure for striped bass fishing during the entire month of August, to limit the recreational fishery’s impact while water temperatures are high. 
However, they also proposed eliminating the no-target closure that is currently in place in Maryland waters during part of the spring spawning period, thus opening the entire spring season to catch and release fishing. 
Maryland fishery managers stated in their presentation to the board that “the proposal is an effort to refocus our conservation effort on the protection of the resident population in the Chesapeake Bay and realign with our neighboring jurisdictions.”
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has “for a long time” advocated for seasonal, summer closures as a way to protect striped bass during the time of year when they are most vulnerable to catch and release mortality.
“There are other fish species in the Bay at that time that are available to fish on, and we know that striped bass are typically pretty stressed during that time of year,” said Colden. 
Studies have shown that when water temperatures exceed 70 degrees in freshwater spawning grounds, the catch and release mortality for striped bass increases significantly, above the usual average of 9%, said McCrickard. 
The board’s technical committee will begin reviewing Maryland’s proposal before meeting again in August to consider what regulatory options for 2026, if any, it wants to approve for public comment.
Members of the board and the public raised concerns at the meeting over the possible negative impacts that could result from lifting no-target protections currently in place in Maryland during the spring spawning period. 
Public comments on the board’s options, which last year exceeded 4,000 submissions but ultimately didn’t spur any additional protections to the 2025 season, would take place between late August through September, according to Franke, before the board makes its final decision on the 2026 regulations in October.
 The eyes and ears on the water

Fishery managers are hesitant to continue piling on regulations to a fishing community that they say as a whole provides many inherent benefits to striped bass recovery efforts. 
Anglers are the eyes and ears on the water, monitoring the species on a regular basis, explained Gary. The information they provide is vitally important to fishery managers.
“When people are fishing, they care about the resource, and they’re going to be the best ones to spread the word to make sure people understand why we need good regulations that secure a promising future for the species,” Gary said. 
Striped bass as a species are currently declared overfished, however there is no active overfishing occurring anymore, as a result of numerous regulatory actions taken by fishery managers after 2019.

Outside of regulating the fishery, angler education is another key to recovering striped bass stocks since usually about 90% of striped bass removals come from the recreational fishery.
McCrickard works to teach anglers about the best catch and release practices to give striped bass the best chance of survival after being released back into the waterway. 
Anglers should always wet their hands before handling striped bass to protect the fish’s protective slime coating, said McCrickard. 
Removing the fish from the water for an extended period is known to have negative impacts, so ideally a soft rubber net can be used to keep the fish in the water when preparing to remove the hook or take a photo, McCrickard said. 
When releasing the fish, McCrickard advises facing them upright against the current and allowing them to swim out of your hands freely when they are ready. 
“Lactic acid builds up in the muscles during the fight, and it’s essential for anglers to let the fish recover on their own terms when they are ready,” he said. 
 Swimming upstream 

There are currently moratoriums effective in Virginia banning the catch and possession of river herring, American shad and Atlantic sturgeon, which are threatened, anadromous species similar to striped bass in that they spend their adult lives in saltwater but migrate to freshwater rivers and streams to spawn. 
“The common theme here is that our native migratory fishes are all struggling; they’re all suffering; they’re all frankly imperilled,” Dunlap said.
Unfortunately there is not a single smoking gun that experts can blame for the declines. If there were, “we’d stand a lot better chance of having greater success for now by bolstering these species,” said Dunlap. “They’re definitely suffering a death by a thousand cuts here.”

Outside of climate change and overfishing, striped bass and migratory fishes in general are known to face losses as a result of unprotected water withdrawals.
“These industrial uses of the river could have the unfortunate capacity to suck in a tremendous amount of larval fish and fish eggs, removing them from that year class,” said Dunlap. “That can unfortunately be just a wrong place, right time issue on the river system.”
There is also increased sediment flowing into the Chesapeake Bay tributaries as a result of more violent and frequent precipitation events and an increase in impermeable land surfaces throughout the watershed.
“The sediment itself will have knock-on effects for the environment,”  Dunlap explained, by burying aquatic vegetation, reducing the sunlight available for photosynthesis and changing the habitat for species that depend on it. 
There are also habitat access issues as a result of the construction of dams and road culverts that block fish passage, as well as the understudied threat of a large invasive blue catfish population that feeds on and competes with native fish.

(Courtesy of Chesterfield County Public Schools)In a rare moment of bipartisan agreement on education policy, Virginia leaders have enacted sweeping changes to the state’s K-12 testing system, aiming to raise student performance and make the Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments more meaningful.
Despite ongoing political clashes over broader education policy, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and state lawmakers united earlier this month behind a plan they hope will strengthen student outcomes.
One of the ways the legislation aims to improve outcomes is by making the Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments count as 10% of the student’s final grade — a shift from current policy. The legislation will also require the release of more past exams to improve preparation.
“This is a gigantic step forward for Virginia students,” Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, who believes the changes will offer a clearer and fairer way of evaluating students while creating opportunities to make assessments more rigorous.
“So it’s kind of a win all the way around and will hopefully put us on a better path for better student outcomes across all the different classes,” he said.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson said in a statement that the bill is a “forward-thinking step in modernizing” the commonwealth’s approach to student assessment and achievement. She also said the bill codifies several reform measures adopted by the House Bill 585 Work Group and supported by the governor to make recommendations for the state assessments.
VanValkenburg successfully introduced the bill creating the work group in 2022.
“By introducing greater flexibility in how schools evaluate student learning, this legislation reinforces Virginia’s commitment to educational innovation,” Gullickson said.
The proposal, carried by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, and VanValkenburg, seeks to improve how the SOLs — statewide standardized tests — are administered and used to evaluate what students should know at the end of each grade or course. 
Assessment results help determine student performance in core subjects such as mathematics, reading, history and social science.
Last August, data released by the Department of Education showed modest gains in reading and math pass rates for the 2023-24 school year after a period of targeted recovery efforts. But performance in other subjects remained below levels seen during the 2022-23 school year.
The governor’s administration and Democrats have traded blame over the mixed results. Youngkin’s team has faulted decisions made by the previous Boards of Education, while Democrats and former board members have defended such decisions, which included changing accreditation standards and adjusting the threshold for what’s considered proficiency.
VanValkenburg’s original version of the bill failed to pass in the Senate in February. However, Helmer’s version passed with technical changes before securing approval from the General Assembly.
“I think this makes Virginia a leader in delivering a world-class education for families across the commonwealth,” Helmer told The Mercury.
The lawmakers said the legislation will help ensure that the state’s next testing contract improves the quality of the tests and makes them more transparent — including the release of more exams afterwards.
VanValkenburg said having the vendor release additional tests will allow teachers and parents to use them as practice tools. An earlier version of the bill called for all tests to be released, but that proposal fell through during negotiations.
“Our tests have for the last 20 years been very low quality, and the reason they’ve been low quality is because we haven’t wanted to spend money on them, and the quality of the tests clearly need to improve,” VanValkenburg said.
Under the legislation, tests will be administered during the final two weeks of the school year — a change from the current practice of five to six weeks earlier — to allow time for retakes. Because of early test administration, students who pass often miss class time, as teachers focus on helping students who need to retake the tests.
As a result of the change, VanValkenburg said it will eliminate about a month of lost instructional time each school year. 
“After the exam, there are high levels of absenteeism as teachers concentrate on test-retake prep for the few kids who failed,” the two lawmakers wrote in The Virginian-Pilot in January. “During that wasted month, little other learning takes place. In effect, students lose a month of education — a year of lost instructional time over a career.”
The legislation also aims to improve transparency by giving parents a better sense of how well their students performed on assessments, shifting the grading scale from 600 points to 100 points.
VanValkenburg said, for example, that parents are far more likely to understand a score of 87 on a biology test than a score of 487.
“Pretty instantaneously, you’ll be able to see what you did well on, and what you did poorly on, and teachers will be able to see that too,” VanValkenburg said. “So as a teacher, you’re going to have more time to teach, your kids are going to have more incentive to do well, and you’re going to get more feedback quicker about what went right and what went wrong on those tests.”
The legislation is set to take effect at the start of the 2026-27 school year.

(Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)Alex Titcomb, campaign manager for the ballot question committee “Voter ID for ME,” described the initiative as a means to increase election security and transparency during a recent legislative public hearing. 
“On the note of transparency,” Veteran’s and Legal Affairs Committee co-chair Sen. Craig Hickman asked during the May 2 meeting, “do you think that it was transparent of your ballot question committee to include provisions in this law that have nothing to do with voter ID?”
When The Dinner Table PAC — founded by Titcomb and Republican Rep. Laurel Libby of Auburn with a mission to create a conservative majority in the Maine House of Representatives — launched the campaign in April 2024, it was branded as an effort to require voters to show photo identification at the polls. However, the official five-page petition submitted to the state in January seeks to change additional aspects of Maine election law, such as absentee voting.
“We weren’t hiding it,” Titcomb responded to Hickman. “It’s a publicly available document.” 
Though, Titcomb noted, most people who sign citizen petitions don’t take the time to read them in full. Maine’s citizen initiative process requires a certain number of voter signatures to get a question on the ballot and “Voter ID for ME” gathered well above that threshold.
As stipulated by the state constitution, the initiative first had to go to the Maine Legislature for consideration, and lawmakers could either enact the bill as written or send it to a statewide vote in November 2025. 
The Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee voted unanimously against the legislation last week, with one member absent, which essentially sets it on the latter path to the ballot. The committee also rejected a few other bills with similar aims that could have set up competing ballot measures. 
The Department of the Secretary of State announced the final wording of the referendum question on May 5, which will capture the other aspects of the initiative in addition to the voter identification requirement following requests from the public during a comment period.
“The proposed measure has 28 sections, and Maine law requires that the question be presented in a clear, concise, and direct manner,” Bellows said in a statement to Maine Morning Star on Friday. “318 Mainers spoke up to share their thoughts and suggestions on the initial draft of the phrasing of the question. Given that feedback, the final question describes six changes to the voting process proposed by the underlying legislation.”
Conservative group behind voter ID effort submits 170k signatures to get on November ballot

It will read: “Do you want to change Maine election laws to eliminate two days of absentee voting, prohibit requests for absentee ballots by phone or family members, end ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, ban prepaid postage on absentee ballot return envelopes, limit the number of drop boxes, require voters to show certain photo ID before voting, and make other changes to our elections?”
Under law, voters have the right to appeal the final decision on the wording within ten days, but the department hadn’t received any requests as of Friday.  
Since Bellows called the petition “a wolf in sheep’s clothing” when the petition was first submitted to the state, 24 nonpartisan groups across Maine have since organized their own campaign against the measure, which they characterize as a voter suppression referendum.
The “Save Maine Absentee Voting” coalition kicked off its campaign on Saturday with a rally in Augusta, which featured speakers from Democracy Maine, Maine Women’s Lobby, American Postal Workers Union, the Wabanaki Alliance and disability rights advocates. 
Maine requires identification and proof of residency in order to register to vote but is among 15 states that do not require voters to present identification while at the polls.
The voter ID effort in Maine follows a national trend from Republicans pushing for such requirements, amid conflicting research on their impact.
Supporters of voter ID laws argue they’ll decrease the risk of fraud and increase confidence in election results. Meanwhile, opponents argue voter ID requirements block legitimate voters from casting ballots, create anti-immigrant sentiment and feed an unfounded fear of widespread voter fraud. 
In addition to requiring voter ID at the polls, the referendum in Maine also seeks to roll back ongoing absentee voting, which allows voters to have absentee ballots mailed to them automatically for each election cycle, and repeal the provision allowing immediate family members to drop off ballots for each other.
It would also remove the option for municipalities to get approval for multiple ballot drop boxes and change who can collect their contents. Currently, non-partisan municipal clerks are responsible for collection but the referendum would make it a “bipartisan team of election officials,” though it doesn’t specify how those teams would be decided. 
The petition also seeks to change the process for challenging someone’s right to vote. Under current law, it’s up to a challenger to prove that someone doesn’t have the right to vote in a certain election. The petition wants to shift the burden of proof onto the person being challenged. 
The one portion of the referendum that its organizers and voting rights groups agree is beneficial is that it would create an option for Mainers to get free nondriver identification cards.
Related measures also rejected by the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee last week included LD 38 sponsored by Sen. Jeff Timberlake (R-Androscoggin) — which the committee rejected 7-5, with one member absent — and LD 397 sponsored by Rep. Reagan Paul from (R-Winterport) — which was rejected unanimously, with one member absent. 
These bills will still head to the chambers for floor votes, however the committee’s recommendations set them up to be killed. 
The committee did not hold a hearing on LD 1880, sponsored by Libby, because it was nearly identical to referendum legislation. Instead, the committee voted it out as “leave to withdraw,” which essentially means the bill is dead, though it technically can be recalled with the support of a two-thirds vote of both chambers.

(Getty photo)Across Rhode Island, children enter foster care every week because their homes are no longer safe — due to a range of complex factors, including family instability, abuse, unmet needs, or other family challenges. When that happens, we don’t just need shelter. We need people. We need families who can meet children where they are, offer compassion and consistency, and help them begin to heal.
The problem is, those families are getting harder to find.
According to the most recent data, approximately 1,272 children under the age of 21 are in the care of Rhode Island’s Department of Children Youth and Families (DCYF) and living in out-of-home placements. But the number of licensed foster homes is shrinking. Too often, children wait in hospitals, residential treatment facilities, or bounce between short-term placements simply because there’s nowhere else for them to go. In some cases, siblings are separated — not because it’s in their best interest, but because no one can take them together.
Foster parents have always been asked to do a lot. But today, they are doing more than ever: caring for children who have experienced complex trauma, navigating behavioral and medical challenges, and coordinating services across multiple systems — all while parenting.
And they are doing it with less. Fewer fellow foster parents to lean on. Less access to respite care. Fewer placements to share the load. Less certainty about the resources that will be there for them tomorrow.
Despite these challenges, foster parenting remains one of the most impactful roles a Rhode Islander can play. I’ve seen it firsthand. I’ve seen teens placed in homes where they were listened to — maybe for the first time — and start to believe they matter. I’ve seen toddlers learn to sleep through the night again, and siblings reunited in a living room that’s suddenly filled with laughter.
What foster parents provide isn’t just shelter. It’s safety, consistency, and the hope of a brighter future.
And yet, we rarely talk about what these families need. We thank them in May, but gratitude isn’t enough. They need respite, mental health resources, community, and predictable support from the systems around them. They need to be treated not as temporary caregivers, but as essential partners in a child’s recovery and growth.










I’ve seen teens placed in homes where they were listened to — maybe for the first time — and start to believe they matter. I’ve seen toddlers learn to sleep through the night again, and siblings reunited in a living room that’s suddenly filled with laughter.


Policy conversations around foster care often center on recruitment — but recruitment is only part of the equation. Retention — ensuring that families stay engaged and supported over time — requires meaningful, sustained investment. That means adequate reimbursement rates, and timely, barrier-free access to the services they need, without having to navigate a maze of referrals or red tape. We need a “no wrong door” approach and a system of care that’s easy to understand and navigate.
It also means investing in a stable workforce — one where families aren’t met with long waitlists, and where workers have manageable caseloads and the capacity to provide consistent, compassionate support. And it means ensuring foster parents themselves have access to emotional support, ongoing training, and responsive systems of care.
What’s at stake isn’t just program success — it’s the well-being of children who’ve already lost too much.
If we want foster families to keep showing up, we must meet them there — with better support, stronger networks, and policies that reflect the gravity of what we ask them to do. Because every child who needs a foster home deserves one. And every person willing to open their home deserves our full support.
This Foster Care Awareness Month, let’s not only thank foster families. Let’s stand behind them — and ensure they’re not standing alone.

Fears about the trouble that lies ahead for North Carolina now that judges have okayed the scheme to give auditor Dave Boliek control over the state Board of Elections, were confirmed last week by the cruel and classless behavior of Boliek’s new right-wing appointees.
After firing longtime elections board executive director Karen Brinson Bell – a rigorously nonpartisan professional who worked miracles on a shoestring budget and won national acclaim for her work to help western North Carolinians vote after Hurricane Helene – the new board members wouldn’t even allow her to say farewell.
When she asked to say a few words at her final board meeting, Boliek’s new appointees adjourned before she could say a word and walked out of the room.
Unbowed by the shabby treatment, Brinson Bell stayed behind to deliver a powerful message to the news media and other witnesses.
The bottom line: For nearly six years, Karen Brinson Bell dedicated her career to strengthening our democracy and exemplifying public service at its finest – two concepts about which the men who fired her haven’t a clue.

U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
The most likely Medicaid cuts would hit rural areas the hardest

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”










As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.

But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

(Screenshot | New Hampshire General Court)The New Hampshire Senate Finance Committee moved Friday to restore three health care programs that had been cut from the state budget by the House Finance Committee — a bipartisan move meant to address heavy pushback. 
In a series of votes at their meeting Friday, the committee voted to reverse the House’s 3% rate cut for the state’s Medicaid providers, and to restore funding to address the developmental disabilities waitlist and for community mental health support. 
The votes come after a nine-hour public hearing on the budget Tuesday in which the health care cuts dominated attendees’ concerns. Hospital representatives, disability rights advocates, and care recipients themselves appealed to the committee to restore the funding. 
“We want to get the message out to the people that we have listened to them and we are taking action on their requests,” said Sen. James Gray, a Rochester Republican and the Senate Finance chairman, just after the amendments passed. 
Gov. Kelly Ayotte has criticized the House’s cuts since the chamber passed its budget April 10, taking particular issue with the Medicaid provider cuts. 
The votes came at the beginning of the Senate Finance Committee’s four-week push to finalize a recommended budget. Two Democrats and six Republicans — who include Senate President Sharon Carson — must grapple with the $643 million of cuts the House made to Ayotte’s February proposed budget. 
The health care cuts represented a large portion of those cuts, but not all of them. Among the decisions left for the Senate are whether to restore the House’s $50 million cut to the university system, its elimination of 190 Department of Corrections positions, and its move to end the Office of the Child Advocate, a watchdog over the Division for Children, Youth and Families; the Housing Appeals Board; the State Council on the Arts; and the Office of the Right to Know Ombudsman.

In a statement Friday, Ayotte thanked the committee for the amendments, but said she would continue to be involved in the budget. She has recently raised concerns about the cuts to the Department of Corrections and the university system. 
“I’m pleased that the Senate Finance Committee reversed cuts to Medicaid provider rates and restored funding for mental health services and care for those with disabilities,” Ayotte said. “We need a responsible budget that serves our most vulnerable citizens, and I will remain involved in this process to ensure we deliver this for all of New Hampshire.”
Republicans control the governor’s office, House, and Senate, but the party is split over how much the state will raise in taxes and how much the Legislature should spend. 
The House’s budget took a conservative approach, passing a budget that assumed that revenues would be much lower than Ayotte’s February projections. On Wednesday, the Senate Ways and Means Committee struck a middle ground between Ayotte and the House, passing revenue projections that landed about in the middle between the other two. 
Those projections will affect how the Senate Finance Committee approaches its budgeting over the next month, and will likely allow some — but not all — of the cuts to be restored. On Friday, Gray and others said the decision to move so quickly to restore the three health care cuts represented the Senate’s priorities. 
“We will be taking many, many, many votes as we move things in and out of both House Bill 1 and House Bill 2,” Gray said. “It is a statement of our intent that these be the first three votes that we take.”
Senators on both sides of the aisle took moments to highlight the importance of the funding restoration.
The House’s proposed across-the-board 3% funding cut to all Medicaid providers amounted to a $52 million reduction in state funding, and would also cause the state to lose an equivalent amount of matching federal funding. Opponents had testified Tuesday that the cut would make it even harder to find caregivers for home health services, and providers said it would force cutbacks in services.
Sen. David Watters, a Dover Democrat, recalled one person at the hearing calling Medicaid a “lifeline.” “And I think we’re restoring that lifeline,” he said Friday.
And senators praised the amendment to restore developmental disability funding. The House had cut $31.4 million from that program, a move that also threatened federal match funding. The state has a waitlist of people who are eligible for services for those disabilities, such as those to help with transportation, housing, and employment. 
“I was in the House when we ended the (developmental disability) waitlist in 2007 and what a joyous, important moment that was,” said Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, a Nashua Democrat. “That was a long time coming.”
Carson, a Londonderry Republican, agreed. “We’ve taken individuals that were quite frankly marginalized for very long, and they’ve become active, contributing members of our society, and that’s what we want,” she said. “… As a parent of a disabled adult, I know how difficult it can be for disabled individuals to navigate our world, and this helps them.”
Sen. Regina Birdsell, a Hampstead Republican, applauded the return of the funding for community mental health. The House had cut Ayotte’s proposed funding by $37.8 million, or 37.5%. 
“We need to continue putting the funding forward for our mental health programs that we have worked so hard to put into place,” Birdsell said. 
The Senate Finance Committee is working to finalize recommendations for the state’s two budget bills, House Bill 1 and 2, by June 3. The full Senate will then vote on the bills on June 5, and if they pass, they will likely head to a committee of conference with the House, where House and Senate leaders will negotiate to end with a bill both chambers can agree on.

In a court filing, they said the move would destabilize the economy and “brush aside a century of precedent.” 
The Federal Trade Commission is one of two federal agencies tasked with enforcing antitrust law. In the past several years it has sued huge health care conglomerates, as well as big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta. 
It also blocked the merger of grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons. So the FTC might not be terribly popular in some corporate boardrooms these days. Anticompetitive practices by giant players are thought to have resulted in lower wages and higher prices for consumers.

The other federal antitrust watchdog, the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, has roots going back to 1903. But that department is overseen by the Attorney General, a presidential appointee. 
In 1914, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act creating an antitrust watchdog that is more insulated from politics. It provided for a minimum number of appointees from each party, provided them with seven-year terms and allowed reappointment. Crucially, presidents can only remove them for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”
Despite that, news broke in March that Trump was trying to fire commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter, both Democratic appointees. Trump was doing so without alleging any of the deficiencies required by the law to allow for their dismissal. 
In a social media post, Bedoya said Trump was trying to do a favor for his ultra-rich supporters.
“Now, the president wants the FTC to be a lapdog for his golfing buddies,” Bedoya wrote.
Trump has also tried to remove commissioners from independent agencies such as the Federal Election Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protections Board and the National Transportation Safety Board. Critics, including Slaughter and Bedoya, said that undermining such independent agencies would undermine faith in and the stability of the national economy.
In a court brief justifying the FTC firings, Trump’s lawyers wrote that following the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act would improperly limit the president’s authority.
“An order requiring the president to reinstate officials he has chosen to remove from office would be an extraordinary intrusion on the president’s exclusive authority to exercise control over the executive branch,” the filing said, according to Newsweek.
Lawyers for the Democratic FTC commissioners said that’s a gross misreading of the law and history.
Trump is asking the court “to brush aside a century of precedent in favor of an untenable reading of (the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Seila Law v Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) that ignores broad swaths of that opinion, misconstrues the FTC’s authority, side-steps much of U.S. history, and would overturn several Supreme Court decisions and invalidate two-dozen statutes adopted and adhered to by nearly every President and Congress over the last 150 years,” Bedoya and Slaughter’s lawyers said in a court filing. 
Late last month, a Trump ally, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, made another move that critics said was intended to protect the president’s wealthy supporters — particularly Elon Musk, the world’s richest man — from antitrust enforcement. From his perch as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jordan tried to insert in a spending bill a measure that would move the FTC’s personnel and funding to the Justice Department. 
However, it wouldn’t have moved the FTC’s unique enforcement powers along with them. Jordan later withdrew the measure.
The Democratic FTC commissioners are fighting in court to stop Trump’s attempt to fire them, calling it “blatantly illegal.” They and lawyers for the president are asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to decide the case on an expedited basis.
In a written statement, a lawyer for a firm representing the Democratic commissioners, Clarick, Gueron, Reisbaum, said Trump is ignoring past decisions of the judiciary.
“… it’s undisputed that his attempted firings violate the plain language of the FTC Act, and the President’s claim to inherent executive authority to fire FTC Commissioners defies 90 years of Supreme Court precedent,” the lawyer, Aaron Crowell, said.
A lawyer for another group representing Slaughter and Bedoya, Protect Democracy, said Trump is trying to ignore not only the courts, but Congress as well. And in so doing, the president threatens to destabilize the U.S. economy, said the lawyer, Amit Agarwal.
“Congress had good reasons for protecting regulators from at-will removal, not the least of which is that agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Reserve need to have the ability to make critical decisions with integrity and to apply the law without fear or favor,”Agarwal said.  “When the Supreme Court settled this dispute nine decades ago, it decided in favor of Congress’s right to protect the public interest. We hope the courts do so again.”

Republican state Reps. Angie King, R-Celina, and Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., recently introduced House Bill 249, also known as the Enact the Indecent Exposure Modernization Act.

The bill would prohibit an adult cabaret performance from taking place outside an adult cabaret. It also broadens the definition of adult cabaret performances to include “performers or entertainers who exhibit a gender identity that is different from the performer’s or entertainer’s gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, prosthetic or imitation genitals or breasts, or other physical markers.”
The bill includes drag performers, topless dancers, go-go dancers, strippers and exotic dancers.
“I am deeply committed to protecting our children,” King said in a statement. “As a mother and as a legislator, I believe Ohio families should feel safe taking their children to a city park without the risk of coming across an event or person performing in a way that incorporates themes, imagery, and acts intended for mature audiences.”
Williams said they are seeing a trend of “indecent exposure and over-sexualized performances taking place in public in the presence of children.”
“This legislation is simply updating already existing law to the times that we are living in,” he said in a statement. “So, we want to update the obscenity law so we can ensure families and children are protected from these acts.”
H.B. 249 comes with penalties ranging from a first degree misdemeanor if a performance happens in front of a juvenile, a fifth degree felony if the performance is obscene and a fourth degree felony if the performance is obscene and happened in front of someone 12 years old and younger. 
This is not the first time this bill has been introduced. King and Williams introduced a nearly identical bill during the last General Assembly, but it only had two committee hearings. The bill received lots of opposition from Ohio’s LGBTQ community.

The Ohio House has made no secret about its frustration with the Ohio Elections Commission. In a contentious hearing, lawmakers on the House Finance committee grilled the agency’s executive director Phil Richter over perceived shortcomings. They argued cases drag on too long and the process is too tedious.
In a Senate committee hearing last week, lawmakers were receptive to Richter’s warnings that handing oversight to county boards of elections and a hearing officer in the Secretary of State’s office would lead to a “patchwork” of decisions.
But they had critiques for Richter, too. The chairman, Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster, didn’t seem all that concerned about devolving campaign finance cases. “What’s the problem with that model?” he asked. Meanwhile, Sen. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, argued the commission needs to move more quickly and use “more teeth.”
Ohio Elections Commission urges state senators to restore funding in budget

The Secretary’s letter
In his letter to McColley, LaRose argued the commission “has become an increasingly toothless and inconsistent shell of what it was intended to be.” In particular he highlighted nearly $100 million in fines that have gone uncollected. In addition to “sending a terrible message that you can break the law and get away with it,” LaRose argued, that money could be put to good use.
“The General Assembly could fund schools, repair aging infrastructure, upgrade election equipment, or even reduce taxes with that uncollected revenue,” LaRose wrote. “Wrongdoing might actually be deterred if fines were treated as more than a suggestion.”
But the secretary insisted it’s a bad idea to decentralize campaign finance oversight — making the same argument about potentially scores of different enforcement decisions.
“These board members, hard-working as they are, often serve as local political party chairs,” LaRose added. “They should not be placed in the awkward, unsolicited position of policing their own candidates, nor are they staffed, equipped, or trained to manage these complex cases.”
LaRose noted his office has been talking with lawmakers about potential changes since at least last year. In those talks, the secretary proposed expanding the commission’s purview to conservative fixations like ballot harvesting and noncitizen voting. His office also urged the commission to move cases more quickly and require members have relevant legal experience.
The secretary warned if his office has to take over administration of OEC duties it would cost at least $800,000. The governor’s initial proposal budgeted $812,600 and $885,100 for the agency in the next two years.
And perhaps most important, LaRose argued the House plan to abolish the commission by July is too hasty.
“We likely need more time to facilitate that transition,” LaRose wrote. “On this point, I can again find common ground with Mr. Richter in saying that any reform of the OEC should be done through a transition over the remainder of the current calendar year.”
Asked about the Secretary’s letter after the Senate session Wednesday, McColley said he’d yet to read it. On the topic of abolishing the Ohio Elections Commission more generally, he kept his powder dry.
“Obviously, we’ll look at what the House sent over, and we’ll talk with some of our members as to what they’re ideas are,” McColley said. He put special emphasis on members like Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, who have worked on several pieces of elections-related legislation in recent years, but held off on taking any firm position until his caucus weighs in.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Ohio Republican Party has endorsed businessman Vivek Ramaswamy for governor.
Ohio’s gubernatorial election is still a year away, but the race to replace Gov. Mike DeWine is heating up with endorsements, commercials and media attention.
In a meeting in Columbus on Friday afternoon, the Ohio GOP State Central Committee voted in favor of the Cincinnati entrepreneur.
Ramaswamy secured the nomination over Attorney General Dave Yost, with 60 votes to 3.
“Ohio’s best days are gonna be ahead of us,” Ramaswamy told reporters after his endorsement acceptance speech.
President Donald Trump’s ally is running on a platform of revitalizing the state.
“We’re going to have rollouts of major policies addressing what I see as some of the most pressing issues that Ohio is gonna have to confront in the next decade… Issues like population decline, issues like a looming energy and potential electricity shortage in our state, issues like the educational achievement deficiency,” he continued.
Ramaswamy made his splash into politics in 2023. He ran to become the Republican nominee for president before dropping out to endorse and support Trump for the remainder of the campaign. He went to Harvard and Yale Law, where he worked in investments and started a firm. He was appointed to the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency before he was ousted by tech-mogul Elon Musk, according to reporting from POLITICO.
He announced his bid for Ohio governor back in February.



But not everyone wanted Ramaswamy. State Auditor Keith Faber explained that he would have rather waited until it was closer to the election to choose.
“I respect Dave, I respect Vivek and I respect Lt. Gov. Tressel,” Faber told me. “So, I just didn’t think it was time for me to jump in and endorse personally at this point.”
As Faber mentioned, Ramaswamy beat out Yost.
Yost for Governor Campaign Manager Emily Hottinger issued the following statement:
“We congratulate Mr. Ramaswamy. The Attorney General is going to take a few days to consult with key supporters about the path forward — but the people of Ohio deserve a choice, not a premature coronation of an untested candidate.”


Although some strategists have been pushing Lt. Gov. and former OSU football coach Jim Tressel to run, he hasn’t officially announced. But he is considering a run, according to a statement sent to News 5, which was first reported by NBC News.
Tressell said in the statement: “What has been a surprise, and it has been humbling, is how many people are encouraging me to run for Governor. I have not decided yet, but when I became Lieutenant Governor in February, Ellen told me that it seemed like God had more work for me to do, and she was right. While I have not ruled out a run for Governor – and there will be a time in the future for those conversations — for now, I will remain focused on helping Ohioans get off the sidelines and into our workforce so they can reach their full potential.”
“They all have great strengths,” Faber said. “Let them communicate that themselves to the voters of Ohio.”
So what’s next for Ramaswamy?
“What kind of qualities are you looking for in a lieutenant governor?” WEWS asked Ramaswamy.
“Look, I want a governing partner… The way I hope to lead Ohio is not just to take the existing (organizational) chart as given and fill them in like spots on a place mat, but instead to ask: ‘Who’s gonna lead in the areas where we actually want to make a change and drive a difference to the state?'” he said.
So now, the race is heating up for his second in command, with strategists telling us to keep our eyes on Sec. of State Frank LaRose and State Treasurer Robert Sprague. LaRose is running for auditor, and Sprague is running for secretary of state.
“I look forward to helping Vivek succeed as a candidate and as our next governor. I’m focused right now on doing the job I was elected to do and talking with Ohioans about the future of our state and what I believe I can offer as our next auditor,” LaRose said when asked if he was interested in being LG.
WEWS asked the same to Sprague at the event.
“I’m happy to serve the Vivek’s administration, however he sees fit… I very much want to serve as Secretary of State,” the treasurer said. “To me, it’s all about serving the people of the state of Ohio. We need great leaders at every different level and whatever opportunity that I’m given, I’m gonna perform to the best of my ability.”
But the name coming up the most from strategists is term-limited Senate President Rob McColley. Although he didn’t respond to questions about interest in being LG, he did speak earlier in the day about his support of Ramaswamy.
“We need leadership that’s going to lead boldly, leadership that’s going to lead unapologetically in many ways, to make a lot of very tough decisions, to get us to that next level,” McColley said. “I believe Vivek Ramaswamy represents our best opportunity to do that.”
Still, the primary is a year away — so a lot can change in that time.
On the Democratic side, the only declared candidate is former Ohio Dept. of Health Director Amy Acton.

Renee Erickson chats on the Senate floor during the April 10, 2025, veto session. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Republicans who want to strip public schools of funding, impoverish teachers and stunt learning opportunities for the littlest Kansans have accused educators of “fearmongering.”
Unfortunately, the fearmongers have a point.
Legislators in Topeka underfunded schools for years. The state Supreme Court not only ordered them to change course but kept jurisdiction over the case for five years to ensure compliance. That binding ruling came down in 2019, only to be interrupted by a global pandemic. Now our Legislature plans to rewrite the school funding formula, this time without court oversight. Given lawmakers’ past actions and current rhetoric, educators’ concerns sound well founded.
This session alone, lawmakers reneged on a pledge to significantly boost special education funding. They had made the pledge just last year, but budget-busting tax cuts proved too alluring.
They advocated a mammoth school voucher bill, one that would funnel state money to wealthy families (the proposal didn’t make it through this year).
And just coincidentally, they sent a constitutional amendment to voters that would change the process for selecting state Supreme Court judges — possibly leading to an anti-education high court.
These legislative actions, taken as a whole, suggest that lawmakers want nothing more than to spend less on public schools, shift resources to private religious institutions and face the absolute minimum of scrutiny while doing so. Of course no one will admit to this, but one only has to watch what’s happening and connect the dots.
That’s all before we come to formula rewrites.
While the words sound wonky, the outcome couldn’t be more important. Officials are deciding how to fund the state’s schools for years to come. If they don’t get this right, or if they seek to pull back from prior commitments, a whole generation of Kansas kids could suffer.
A task force held hearings on the subject May 6 and May 7, and Kansas Reflector senior reporter Tim Carpenter covered day one and day two.
Just listen to the voices of those who will be deciding the future of public education.
The task force chairwoman, Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican: “There has been a poisoning of the well against this process already, and superintendents are worried. It doesn’t benefit anyone to poison the well and already start gearing up for an expensive lawsuit without having anything to sue over yet. That mentality is not helpful to anyone in this process.”
Rep. Scott Hill, an Abilene Republican: “I find it bordering on immoral that people would understand, which we all do, that we’ve been teaching kids wrong for a long time. And, to not change that teaching direction on their own without supplemental money is abhorrent.”
Erickson again: “By no means am I going to allow the Legislature to be the convenient villain in this reading scenario. It just defies logic.”
Erickson once more: “We overpay our ineffective teachers way too much. The longer they’re embedded in the system, the harder it is to get rid of the teachers who are not doing right by our kiddos. The sad truth of the matter is those are the teachers that are the highest paid because they’ve been there the longest.”
This should put anyone who cares about public education on high alert, if they aren’t already.
The grandstanding about reading scores, which came on the first day, shows lawmakers shifting the blame as quickly and forcefully as they can. They allocate the money. They pay the teachers. If they don’t like the scores, they can try following the law for a time and see what happens. They could even support the Blueprint for Literacy plan they created just last year. Instead, members and point fingers and accuse others of overreacting.
As for ineffective teachers, that quote came from a discussion about setting a floor on teacher salaries. To her credit, task force vice chairwoman and Rep. Susan Estes, R-Wichita, tried to have a civil discussion on the matter. That appears to have quickly gone south.
Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta, promptly suggested that teachers could get second jobs. Erickson then backed up the idea that quality teaching somehow has nothing to do with seniority or pay.
Finally, task force members sounded bearish about paying for pre-K programs targeting at-risk children.
For Williams, the problem appeared to be that a state program competed with parochial ones: “We have put out of business many Christian schools, preschools and other types of classical education because they can’t compete with a free education.”
And I’m sure that at-risk 3- and 4-year-olds all come from families that can pour money into such programs.
Look, we don’t know what the task force will end up proposing. Perhaps the concerns of superintendents and others with eyes and ears will lead members to take a more constructive path. A clear-eyed view of the situation, however, suggests that those raising alarms have reason to do so. Why would the state underfund special ed, try to increase voucher programs and pass that constitutional amendment? Why would task force members attack schools and experienced educators?
An answer comes to mind, and it sure doesn’t involve spending more money. Kansas lawmakers appear prepared to kick the state’s students and teachers off a ledge while loudly proclaiming their innocence.

As the Trump administration continues to make significant cuts to NIH budgets and personnel and to freeze billions of dollars of funding to major research universities – citing ideological concerns – there’s more being threatened than just progress in science and medicine. Something valuable but often overlooked is also being hit hard: preventing research abuse.
The National Institutes of Health has been the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research. Its support helps translate basic science into biomedical therapies and technologies, providing funding for nearly all treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration from 2010 to 2019. This enables the U.S. to lead global research while maintaining transparency and preventing research misconduct.
While the legality of directives to shrink the NIH is unclear, the Trump administration’s actions have already led to suspended clinical trials, institutional hiring freezes and layoffs, rescinded graduate student admissions, and canceled federal grant review meetings. Researchers at affected universities say that funding will delay or possibly eliminate ongoing studies on critical conditions like cancer and Alzheimer’s.
 


It is clear to us, as legal and bioethics scholars whose research often focuses on the ethical, legal and social implications of emerging biotechnologies, that these directives will have profoundly negative consequences for medical research and human health, with ripple effects that will last decades. Our scholarship demonstrates that in order to contribute to knowledge and, ultimately, to biomedical treatments, medical research at every stage depends on significant infrastructure support and ethical oversight.
Our recent focus on brain organoid research – 3D lab models grown from human stem cells that simulate brain structure and function – shows how federal support for research is key to not only promote innovation, but to protect participants and future patients.
 History of NIH and research ethics

The National Institutes of Health began as a one-room laboratory within the Marine Hospital Service in 1887. After World War I, chemists involved in the war effort sought to apply their knowledge to medicine. They partnered with Louisiana Sen. Joseph E. Ransdell who, motivated by the devastation of malaria, yellow fever and the 1928 influenza pandemic, introduced federal legislation to support basic research and fund fellowships focusing on solving medical problems.
By World War II, biomedical advances like surgical techniques and antibiotics had proved vital on the battlefield. Survival rates increased from 4% during World War I to 50% in World War II. Congress passed the 1944 Public Health Services Act to expand NIH’s authority to fund biomedical research at public and private institutions. President Franklin D. Roosevelt called it “as sound an investment as any Government can make; the dividends are payable in human life and health.”
As science advanced, so did the need for guardrails. After World War II, among the top Nazi leaders prosecuted for war crimes were physicians who conducted experiments on people without consent, such as exposure to hypothermia and infectious disease. The verdicts of these Doctors’ Trials included 10 points about ethical human research that became the Nuremberg Code, emphasizing voluntary consent to participation, societal benefit as the goal of human research, and significant limitations on permissible risks of harm. The World Medical Association established complementary international guidelines for physician-researchers in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.
In the 1970s, information about the Tuskegee study – a deceptive and unethical 40-year study of untreated syphilis in Black men – came to light. The researchers told study participants they would be given treatment but did not give them medication. They also prevented participants from accessing a cure when it became available in order to study the disease as it progressed. The men enrolled in the study experienced significant health problems, including blindness, mental impairment and death.
The public outrage that followed starkly demonstrated that the U.S. couldn’t simply rely on international guidelines but needed federal standards on research ethics. As a result, the National Research Act of 1974 led to the Belmont Report, which identified ethical principles essential to human research: respect for persons, beneficence and justice.
Federal regulations reinforced these principles by requiring all federally funded research to comply with rigorous ethical standards for human research. By prohibiting financial conflicts of interest and by implementing an independent ethics review process, new policies helped ensure that federally supported research has scientific and social value, is scientifically valid, fairly selects and adequately protects participants.
These standards and recommendations guide both federally and nonfederally funded research today. The breadth of NIH’s mandate and budget has provided not only the essential structure for research oversight, but also key resources for ethics consultation and advice.
 Brain organoids and the need for ethical inquiry

Biomedical research on cell and animal models requires extensive ethics oversight systems that complement those for human research. Our research on the ethical and policy issues of human brain organoid research provides a good example of the complexities of biomedical research and the infrastructure and oversight mechanisms necessary to support it.
Organoid research is increasing in importance, as the FDA wants to expand its use as an alternative to using animals to test new drugs before administering them to humans. Because these models can simulate brain structure and function, brain organoid research is integral to developing and testing potential treatments for brain diseases and conditions like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and cancer. Brain organoids are also useful for personalized and regenerative medicine, artificial intelligence, brain-computer interfaces and other biotechnologies.
Brain organoids are built on knowledge about the fundamentals of biology that was developed primarily in universities receiving federal funding. Organoid technology began in 1907 with research on sponge cells, and continued in the 1980s with advances in stem cell research. Since researchers generated the first human organoid in 2009, the field has rapidly expanded.
These advances were only possible through federally supported research infrastructure, which helps ensure the quality of all biomedical research. Indirect costs cover operational expenses necessary to maintain research safety and ethics, including utilities, administrative support, biohazard handling and regulatory compliance. In these ways, federally supported research infrastructure protects and promotes the scientific and ethical value of biotechnologies like brain organoids.
Brain organoid research requires significant scientific and ethical inquiry to safely reach its future potential. It raises potential moral and legal questions about donor consent, the extent to which organoids should be grown and how they should be disposed, and consciousness and personhood. As science progresses, infrastructure for oversight can help ensure these ethical and societal issues are addressed.
 New frontiers in scientific research

Since World War II, there has been bipartisan support for scientific innovation, in part because it is an economic and national security imperative. As Harvard University President Alan Garber recently wrote, “[n]ew frontiers beckon us with the prospect of life-changing advances. … For the government to retreat from these partnerships now risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation.”
Cuts to research overhead may seem like easy savings, but it fails to account for the infrastructure that provides essential support for scientific innovation. The investment the NIH has put into academic research is significantly paid forward, adding nearly US$95 billion to local economies in fiscal year 2024, or $2.46 for every $1 of grant funding. NIH funding had also supported over 407,700 jobs that year.
President Donald Trump pledged to “unleash the power of American innovation” to battle brain-based diseases when he accepted his second Republican nomination for president. Around 6.7 million Americans live with Alzheimer’s, and over a million more suffer from Parkinson’s. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are diagnosed with aggressive brain cancers each year, and 20% of the population experiences varying forms of mental illness at any one time. These numbers are expected to grow considerably, possibly doubling by 2050.
Organoid research is just one of the essential components in the process of learning about the brain and using that knowledge to find better treatment for diseases affecting the brain.
Science benefits society only if it is rigorous, ethically conducted and fairly funded. Current NIH policy directives and steep cuts to the agency’s size and budget, along with attacks on universities, undermine globally shared goals of increasing understanding and improving human health.
The federal system of overseeing and funding biomedical science may need a scalpel, but to defund efforts based on “efficiency” is to wield a chainsaw.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Oh, those pesky social studies standards.
Nebraska’s once vaunted but now diminished rivalry with Oklahoma has come to a shuddering halt. What was born on the gridiron years ago has now expired, as those charged with educating children in the Sooner State have proposed an educational standard with no pedagogical foundation nor semblance of the truth.
If adopted, the state’s high school students, in their study of the presidential election results from 2020, would be required to “identify discrepancies” in the process. Except there weren’t any. 
Sure, some insisted the integrity of the election of Joe Biden was tainted. But no tangible, verifiable evidence was found nor exists today to prove that the election had “discrepancies.” Nor does wishing, hoping, believing or offering debunked conjecture to the contrary make it so. Or worse, make it part of the public school curriculum.
Nebraska wins
If the standard is accepted, Oklahoma students will be learning a lie. Game over. Huskers win.
That’s because to my knowledge, Nebraska’s social study standards entertain no such nonsense. Nevertheless, as we’ve seen before on other fronts, culture war creep is a thing, a reality that can show up anywhere, including Nebraska’s classrooms. See book banning for details.
The standard’s news was among a spate of happenings from the silly to the serious during the last week connected to social studies, history, economics, whatever social science is to your liking. Oklahoma’s potential capitulation, which raises conspiracy theories to the level of actual American history, was only part of the story.
A bill introduced in Congress would codify President Trump’s notion that the Gulf of Mexico hitherto be known as the Gulf of America. His executive order did as much early in his second term, but EOs do not carry the weight or the permanence of an actual law. As you know, laws are what Congress passes, although you’d be hard pressed to find an example of that with the current confab now meeting in the Capitol.
‘Gulf of America’
Enter H.R. 276, which would change the name of the Gulf of Mexico permanently and compel all federal agencies to update their maps and documents to reflect such an alteration. I imagine that would also require a rewrite of state social studies or geography standards. The bill’s sponsor is U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.
Oy, vey! Where to begin? Let’s start (and stop) with this: Why? Yeah, I can’t think of anything either. 
Nebraska U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., thought the entire episode was rather childish: “It just seems juvenile. We’re the United States of America. We’re not Kaiser Wilhelm’s Germany or Napoleon’s France. … We’re better than this. It just sounds like a sophomore thing to do.” Bacon’s nay in the name-change vote was a welcome development despite the measure passing the House. Perhaps Republican U.S. Reps. Mike Flood and Adrian Smith have an answer to why.
A better idea would have been to let the silliness languish, never to be heard from again. The House — and the rest of us — face more pressing matters, not the least of which is the looming crisis over whether or not we are a democratic republic that honors the principle of due process. Enshrined in two Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, due process is the bedrock on which a nation of laws is built.
Due process
Here’s a quick review of those details, all of which should be the social studies standard for anyone who calls America home: The Fifth Amendment says no one shall be “deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.” The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, uses the same eleven words, called the Due Process Clause, to describe a legal obligation of the states. Due process gives us legal procedures (processes), so the government cannot infringe on our individual rights.
More to the point in the current discussion is this: Due process applies to anyone — citizen or not — being adjudicated in the U.S., too, its language using “person” rather than citizen. 
Nevertheless, both the president and his Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, sidestepped the due process question recently. That is, do they believe in it? Trump told NBC’s Kristin Welker he “didn’t know” because he isn’t an attorney. Noem simply would not answer the question during a congressional hearing. 
The nation’s history, like high school social studies, is replete with stories that essentially reveal who we are as a country, what we value — principles such as due process. They are the nation’s standards.
But when they get their corners knocked off, when we fail to live up to them, we no longer resemble ourselves. That’s a standard too far.

John McCosh/Georgia Recorder (file)A federal appellate court is set to hear a case Tuesday centered on a five-year debate over whether the national right-leaning group True the Vote used mass voter challenges to intimidate minority voters.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit will hear arguments in a case in which plaintiffs, including a voting rights group founded by Stacey Abrams, contend that the case has national implications. Attorneys from both sides will have 15 minutes to present their cases during Tuesday’s hearing.
Mass voter challenges have been a mainstay in Georgia since the 2020 presidential election, when Democrat Joe Biden narrowly defeated Republican Donald Trump by about 12,000 votes in the state.
According to the Abrams-founded Fair Fight Action and others who filed suit, True the Vote’s actions likely violated the Voting Rights Act by using inaccurate voter registration information and voter intimidation tactics such as posting citizen watchdogs to monitor people casting ballots.
This case stems from True the Vote’s efforts to challenge the voter eligibility of about 385,000 Georgia voters prior to the January 5, 2021 runoff election, when Democrats would take control of the U.S. Senate following historic wins by Georgia Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.
In January 2024, Gainesville U.S. District Court Judge Steve C. Jones concluded last year that Fair Fight did not prove True the Vote’s actions constituted voter intimidation prior to the dual Senate runoffs.
However, Jones criticized the conservative group’s “reckless” methods in compiling a list of voters.
Opponents of mass challenges claim that groups targeting Democratic-leaning counties are misusing the election law to challenge large numbers of voters as ineligible.

Many conservatives have argued that voter registration lists need to be purged of ineligible voters, while Democrats and progressive activists have alleged that mass voter challenges aim to intimidate and remove voters who should remain eligible.
Fair Fight alleges that True the Vote’s list in the 2021 runoff included a disproportionate number of Black, brown, and first-time voters who helped secure the 2020 presidential race for Biden. 
“The 385,000 mass challenge in the lead up to the January 5, 2021 runoff was the largest mass challenge ever filed in this way in the country,” Fair Fight CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo said. 
There’s been a debate over whether some new voting rules would improve voter confidence or if they are just attempts to appease Trump supporters who say he lost because of unfounded claims of widespread election fraud.
Georgia was at the center of the push to overturn the election results after Trump lost to Biden, becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to lose in Georgia in three decades. Trump’s narrow loss was reaffirmed through three counts, including one recount that was done by hand. Multiple recounts and audits after the 2020 election confirmed it was not tainted by widespread fraud.

According to state law, county election boards must find sufficient probable cause to move forward with an investigation when a voter does not appear to reside at their registered address, lists a non-residential address on their registration, or has other reasons that could disqualify them.
True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht said her group will argue that their tactics promote fair elections when they return to Georgia court Tuesday.
“This isn’t just about one hearing — it’s about holding the line for election integrity and defending the voice of we the people,” she said in a statement. “Our legal team is locked in, sharpening every detail of our strategy. Our fight is to expose truth, uphold principle, and bring transparency to a process.”
Marc Elias, an attorney with Elias Law Firm and founder of left-leaning Democracy Docket, argues that the mass voter challenges in the True the Vote case are an egregious violation of Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which guarantees that voters will not face intimidation during the voting process.
“Now, courts have been chipping away against lots of the federal voting rights protections. I’m not going to sugarcoat that,” Elias said. “That has been true at the U.S. Supreme Court. It’s been true at the lower levels. But the fact is attempts to intimidate voters is still illegal, and 11 B is still goo valid law throughout the country.”

John Kennedy, who chaired the Senate Redistricting Committee, argued during a 2021 special session that the GOP-drawn maps are fair to all Georgians. In 2023, state lawmakers were directed by a federal judge to draw new maps. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWe’ve passed the halfway point between the 2020 U.S. Census and the 2030 U.S. Census, but the battle over redistricting maps based on the last national headcount is still underway in Georgia. On Thursday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments about whether or not to enact new maps. The dispute stems from a claim that the state Legislature drew up maps that violate the Voting Rights Act and dilute the votes of Black Georgians.
In late 2023, the district court struck down those Congressional and legislative maps, and lawmakers returned to the Capitol for another stab at them.
Marina Jenkins, executive director of the National Redistricting Foundation and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said Georgia’s population growth in the 2020 Census came from minority populations, especially Black Georgians, but she said the General Assembly’s maps didn’t reflect that and that lawmakers engaged in dirty tricks by eliminating majority-minority districts to draw new ones.
“The state of Georgia robbed Peter in order to pay Paul by enacting these maps,” she said. “These maps eliminated existing opportunity districts in order to draw so-called new opportunity districts, zeroing out black opportunity statewide. Black Georgia voters who were previously denied their right to equal representation continue to be denied that right, and others had that right revoked altogether on these new maps.”
Much of the debate over the maps came down to the state’s 7th Congressional District, previously represented by Democratic Congresswoman Lucy McBath, which was redrawn to favor a Republican. Republican Rich McCormick now represents the 7th District, while McBath was elected to the 6th District after defeating fellow incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn Bourdeaux.
The old 7th’s population was not majority Black – the plurality of the population was white, but a combination of minority groups made up the majority. Of the district’s voting age population 27% were Black, 21% Hispanic, 15% Asian and about 33% white.
In a court document filed last year, attorneys for Georgia argued that the state was obligated to protect majority Black districts, not districts where a coalition of minorities make up the majority, and that efforts to overturn the maps are political sour grapes.
“Their argument proves only one thing: Plaintiffs are upset that the General Assembly eliminated a safe congressional district for Democrats when it created the required new majority-Black district. But the Voting Rights Act ‘is a balm for racial minorities, not political ones.’ It cannot be hijacked to settle partisan disputes that are fairly decided at the polls,” the state’s attorneys wrote.

Google the word “CT biotech” and the number of recent news articles about successful Connecticut startups, biotechs and biopharmaceutical companies is astounding. Just recently, Merck announced it would acquire Stamford-based SpringWorks Therapeutics for $3.9 billion.
The success of the CT bioscience industry has benefited patients with lifesaving treatments and cures, but it has also bolstered Connecticut’s fiscal outlook immensely.   Connecticut biotech has contributed to property tax rolls, created thousands of high paying jobs for Connecticut residents and has drawn talent from across the world to our state.
Gov. Ned Lamont recognized the value bioscience companies bring to the state earlier this legislative session by proposing an increase to the Research and Development tax credit in his budget. Since R&D so defines the biopharma industry —it takes $2.7 billion of R&D to bring a new medicine to pharmacy shelves— enhancing this tax credit makes great economic development sense.
Unfortunately, the governor has also introduced HB 6870, An Act Addressing Patients’ Prescription Drug Costs which, amongst other things, would implement price controls in the form of tying medicine prices to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
It’s important to underscore that the essential goal of HB 6870 -–to lower patients’ healthcare costs— is laudable and something the Bioscience Growth Council and its members share.
In order to achieve that goal, however, we must recognize that drugs represent only a small part of the healthcare cost equation. Medicines account for only about 15% of what we in the U.S. spend on healthcare. That share of the healthcare dollar has been remarkably stable for 75 years.
To bring meaningful change and cost savings to healthcare it is critical to examine the other 85% of the equation —surgeries and hospital stays, MRIs and CT-scans, doctor’s visits, home healthcare assistance, insurance plan design, to name only a few.
It is also worth noting that this legislation is not occurring in a vacuum. The ongoing threat of tariffs at the federal level has already contributed to significant instability and concern for the bioscience industry (and many others).
The governor’s healthcare bill would limit price increases drug manufacturers can charge for generic and off-patent drugs to the CPI.
Nominally keeping generic and off-patent drug price increases in line with inflation as measured by the CPI may seem reasonable, but it ignores the fact that the CPI is an average of a broad spectrum of products. The CPI does not reflect the rate of inflation for any one specific product category. The overall January CPI, for example, was three percent, but for eggs it was 15.2%.
The components of the drug supply chain, including the supply chain for generic and off-patent drugs, are many and variable.  They are sourced from around the world. This is especially the case for the complex manufacturing applicable to injectable and infused biologics.
The price increases suppliers in the generic and off-patent drug supply chain charge for ingredients can often exceed the CPI.  Since many parts of and ingredients used in drug manufacturing are sourced from overseas, currency fluctuations can have a dramatic effect on prices significantly in excess of the CPI. At a time when actions in Washington have already significantly affected the supply chain, it is critical that Connecticut leaders take a pause before further upending the supply chain for Connecticut companies. Not only is this a financially smart decision it also helps to reduce the risk that Connecticut (and all) patients will no longer be able to access their medications should further supply disruptions occur.
It’s also important to recognize that tethering medicine prices to a rigid formula like the CPI is a form of price control and price controls never work. No matter the product—flour, machinery, medicines— price controls cause shortages, delay the introduction of new products and manufacturing capacity, give rise to black markets and incentivize high introduction prices.
A rigorous study —academic or otherwise— demonstrating the effectiveness of price controls does not exist.
Price controls didn’t work when Richard Nixon tried them, didn’t work in Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, and aren’t working in Venezuela or Zimbabwe.
When tried, all price controls have done is ratchet up the misery of empty store shelves and metastasizing inflation.  Applied to medicines, they would translate into shortages and slow, or non-existent, introduction of new, cutting-edge cures and therapies.
If the cost of ingredients for a medicine spike beyond the CPI and manufacturers can’t cover their costs, we certainly would not want government policy to be the cause of manufacturers leaving the market and consumers facing empty pharmacy shelves.

Others were advocating for those whose voices are often silenced, pushing back against an administration determined to strip us of our own. Some were even pushing individuals in wheeled chariots, those unable to run the race themselves, so they, too, could cross the finish line.

As I watched, I began to cry. It started with a single tear escaping down my cheek, and before I knew it, I was sobbing. That’s when I realized – I was starved for kindness; for compassion; for the simple, profound reminder that humanity is still capable of showing up for one another.
Lately, it feels like I lose a little more faith each day in the values we were taught as children. The headlines are relentless: thousands losing their jobs overnight; mothers praised only if they bear six children, a cruel hallmark of this new “baby-booming” administration; a father torn from his family and deported to El Salvador, despite having every legal right to remain.
My parents raised me to believe in sharing, caring, loving, forgiveness, and respecting others. I still try to live by those principles. But more and more, I find myself asking, where has the compassion gone?
As a graduate student at Yale, I’m part of a group that puts these principles into action, our “Compassionate Dialogue Group.” It’s a space shared by students and faculty who come together, not to debate or to solve, but simply to be present. We gather to listen, deeply and respectfully. We talk about our worries, our joys, our lives. There’s no agenda. Just the quiet, powerful understanding that whatever is shared will be met with kindness. That here in this group, we are safe. Here, we are seen. Here, we are nourished by compassion and respect.
It sounds simple. But lately, practicing compassionate dialogue outside of that space has become harder than ever. People don’t want to listen, especially if your perspective challenges theirs. Sometimes they don’t want to listen at all. And yet, over the past year, I’ve found deep relief in the silence of our sessions, sitting quietly, listening to the stories of those around me, and being reminded that the values I was raised with still live in others. That they’re not just relics from childhood, but guiding truths that can still shape the world around us.
So, the question becomes: how do we spread this? How do we rebuild a culture of compassion, respect, and real listening, in our relationships, in our communities, in ourselves?
While I don’t have all the answers, I do have a few challenges for you.
I challenge you to talk to a stranger, not a deep conversation, just a compliment, a kind word. You never know how much it might mean. I challenge you to sit back during your next conversation and truly listen. Don’t speak unless your words add something meaningful. Silence holds incredible power. And finally, I challenge you to end each day reflecting on where you encountered compassion, whether it was something you received or something you gave.
Growing up, my dad and I would recite a list of words each morning before school. Those words still hang on a sign in my family’s living room:
Sharing. Caring. Loving.
Focus. Concentrate. Participate.
Give compliments. Leadership. Forgiveness. Respect.
These were more than just words, they were a blueprint for how to live and how to treat others. And I believe that if we truly practiced them, if we made space for each other with compassion and courage, so much of what feels broken could begin to heal.

(Photo by Yehyun Kim/ctmirror.org)The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed to push a May 19 strike deadline at 51 Connecticut nursing homes back until May 27, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday.
A spokesman for SEIU 1199NE confirmed the delay, which the Lamont administration sought.
“Earlier this week, I met with union leadership representing Connecticut’s nursing home and group home workers and expressed to them that I agree that their current wages do not match the value of the service they provide and that I join them in their effort to seek an increase in their compensation,” Lamont said. “Additionally, I informed them that I believe there is a consensus among legislative leaders who also feel the same and that we are working to negotiate a state budget that includes support for this workforce.”
The governor added that “Connecticut’s nursing home and group home workers do strenuous work on behalf of our most vulnerable residents, and my administration is committed to reaching a positive resolution on their behalf as soon as possible.”
Union president Rob Baril said Friday that “we had a couple of conversations with the governor’s office, and we were extremely clear” about wage and benefit concerns.
The union wants to boost starting pay for caregivers to $25 per hour and, over several years, elevate most employees to about $30 per hour. Most nursing home workers in the state currently earn between $18 and $22 per hour, a wage that leaves many members in poverty.
Though wage and benefit negotiations technically are between private sector nursing homes and their staff, the state often plays a role in resolving labor-management disputes in this industry.
That’s because, on average, more than 80% of nursing home revenue involves patients whose care is covered by federal and state Medicaid dollars.
Baril added the Lamont administration indicated it’s working hard to identify the resources necessary to bolster wages and benefits. “We are going to take them at their word,” Baril said.
Providing the type of raises the union seeks would require a major new public investment in nursing homes.
SEIU 1199NE estimates it would require an extra $550 million in Medicaid payments over the next two fiscal years combined, an annual average of $275 million, to fund the improved wages and benefits workers are seeking.
About 50% of Connecticut’s Medicaid expenses in most program areas are covered through federal reimbursement, which would make the effective annual cost to the state about $137.5 million.
Meanwhile, Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority are already struggling to develop a new state budget that complies with the constitutional cap that keeps most spending growth in line with household income and inflation. They hope to adopt a new two-year state budget before the regular 2025 session ends on June 4.
Earlier this month, the union set a May 19 strike deadline. The potential work stoppage would affect roughly 5,700 nursing home workers.
But this year’s state budget negotiations are far most complex than usual, given the uncertain future of Medicaid, a federal health care entitlement program run in cooperation with states.
Congress set a goal of achieving cuts to Medicaid and other programs worth $880 billion over the next decade. Lamont’s administration has modeled potential cuts, based on various proposals on Capitol Hill that could cost Connecticut anywhere from $186 million to $880 million per year.
Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, the state’s largest nursing home coalition, thanked state and union officials for their continuing efforts to avoid a strike.
“Separating nursing home residents from their caregivers causes real harm and trauma,” Barrett said. “Workforce development, including wage and benefit enhancements as an employee retention and recruitment policy for both union and non-union employees, is essential to addressing the care needs of Connecticut’s dramatically aging population.”
