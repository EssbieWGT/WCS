(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)A bill to create an exemption for cigar rooms from the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act is headed to the House floor — and legislation to strengthen the Act by including e-cigarettes and vape pens in the definition of smoking is headed to the governor’s desk.
Senate Bill 150, sponsored by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, is an attempt to help the hospitality and tourism industry in the state by allowing places where cigar aficionados can legally smoke indoors.
Galt said cigar bars are legal in many states, and a supporter representing the hospitality industry said the lack of an exemption here means Montana is at a competitive disadvantage.
In a statement Friday, Galt said he’s pleased with the progress the bill has made.
“Adults over 21 years of age would have the option to enjoy a cigar in a contained location that meets proper ventilation requirements separate from an established bar or restaurant,” Galt said.
Opponents of the bill argue it undercuts an agreement made decades earlier among legislators, some health advocates and the Montana Tavern Association to put the Clean Indoor Air Act in place in 2005 but allow four years for bars to comply.
The Department of Public Health and Human Services describes it as “one of the most important public health policies in state history.”
Montana Tavern Association spokesperson John Iverson could not be reached for comment Friday.
However, at a hearing in March, Iverson told the House Committee on Business and Labor that his board had a robust debate about the bill and didn’t support it because it undercuts the Clean Indoor Air Act.
“It does that by exposing employees to smoke in their workplace,” Iverson said. “For a long time now, our employees have not been exposed to smoke in their workplace.”
But Iverson said the organization would support the bill if it was amended to prohibit employees from entering the room where patrons are smoking and the room had separate ventilation.
This week, the committee voted on an amendment that changed the venue from “cigar bar” to “cigar room” and said employees can’t enter the room while smoking is taking place unless there’s an emergency.
As currently drafted, the bill would allow smoking of premium cigars in “cigar rooms,” separate enclosed spaces on premises that have a license to serve alcohol.
Patrons wouldn’t be able to smoke anything but premium cigars in those rooms, as the bill is written. So no marijuana or cigarettes.
The bill requires a cigar room to be enclosed and have “a solid door” and a ventilation system that doesn’t send exhausted air to nonsmoking areas.
Thursday, the committee approved the bill on a 12-8 party line vote.
In a phone call Friday, CB Pearson, a public health advocate, said the legislation is worse than originally drafted for the health of workers.
“It is the biggest intrusion into the Clean Indoor Air act and the biggest threat that we have faced over the last 20 years,” Pearson said.
Pearson said one reason he believes the current draft is worse is the original bill required a cigar bar to be a separate, standalone structure, and the amended version allows for a separate room in a building.
But he said rooms leak toxic particulates, such as when someone opens a door.
The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers’ position is that even when “all practical means of separation and isolation of smoking areas are employed, adverse health effects from exposure in non-smoking spaces in the same building cannot be eliminated.”
It also means an employee who enters the room after hours to clean is exposed to particulates because they fall on the floor and stick to the walls, Pearson said.
“There is no way to have a facility that can protect workers if they have to go in and clean up or attend to a site,” Pearson said.
Before it was amended, Galt told the House committee he had been running a version of the cigar bar bill since he first started in the legislature in the House.
“We have continued working on it, trying to tweak it where we can,” Galt said.
Friday, Galt said the idea the bill is worse for public health than when it started is incorrect because it bans employees from entering those rooms.
“During the legislative process, the bill was amended to be contained to a single room in which employees aren’t permitted to enter,” Galt said. “While this wasn’t my original language, it is the result of the legislative process, and I am glad to see it one step closer to becoming law.”
The bill will head to the House floor as amended.
Another bill that affects the Clean Indoor Air Act is Senate Bill 390, sponsored by Sen. Willis Curdy, D-Missoula. It regulates vapes and e-cigarettes.
It passed out of the Senate on Tuesday on a bipartisan 34-16 vote after being amended in the House.
Rep. George Nikolakakos, R-Great Falls, carried the bill in the House, and he said he’s generally a fan of vices.
However, he said he believes there’s a social contract that needs to be honored when it comes to freedom and vices, and the deal includes regulation.
He said Montanans support the Clean Indoor Air Act — a poll said as much as 89% — and Montana has the second highest rate in the nation of vape use, and four times the rate of smoking among adolescents.
“E-cigarettes came into the market just after we passed the Clean Indoor Air Act, so honestly, they probably would have been included had this been on the market at the time,” Nikolakakos said.
The Governor’s Office did not respond to a question Friday about whether Gov. Greg Gianforte would sign SB 390, which is headed to his desk, or if he would have any concerns about an exemption to the Clean Indoor Air Act in SB 150.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos01-scaled-e1731707160413-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

(Photo via Google Earth)  Catholic Health Initiatives-Iowa has dropped its argument in a medical malpractice case that the loss of an unborn child does not equate to the death of a “person” for the purpose of calculating damage awards.
The nonprofit, tax-exempt entity is one of several defendants in a Polk County malpractice case involving the death of an unborn child.
Last month, attorneys for CHI and MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center argued an unborn child should not be considered a “patient” for purposes of calculating damages in the case. They also argued that “finding an unborn child to be a ‘person’ would lead to serious implications in other areas of the law.”
That position appeared to clash with CHI’s mission statement and ethics guidelines, both of which are based on the concept that human life begins at the moment of conception.
In Iowa, court-ordered awards for noneconomic losses stemming from medical malpractice are capped at $250,000, except in cases that entail the “loss or impairment of mind or body.” Initially, CHI and MercyOne argued the cap on damages applied in cases where the “loss” was that of a fetus or an unborn child.
However, during a court hearing on Friday, an attorney for CHI and MercyOne, Christine Conover, informed the court it was withdrawing from the motion to cap damages in the case on that basis.
“We are a Catholic hospital and obviously the Catholic faith believes that life begins at conception,” Conover told Polk County District Judge Scott J. Beattie.
“To be honest, I had wondered about that stance,” Beattie told Conover, referring to the hospital’s previously filed motion seeking to cap damages. “It seemed like kind of an odd stance,” he added, noting that it seemed to contradict the position that CHI had taken in other legal matters.
In a written statement issued Friday, Bob Ritz, president and CEO of MercyOne, stated “we are heartbroken that our belief that human personhood begins at conception would ever be called into question. As a Catholic health system, the sanctity of life is not just a belief we hold; it is the foundation of every action we take.
“While the motion (to limit damages) was accurate from a purely legal standpoint, it has caused confusion and concern. That is why we have asked our counsel to withdraw the motion with respect to MercyOne. No courtroom argument should ever cast doubt on the deeply held Catholic values that guide MercyOne.
“At MercyOne, our Catholic identity is not something we set aside. It is central to who we are. It shapes how we serve and care for people in their most sacred and vulnerable moments. We are more than a health system. We are a health ministry. Our commitment to respect the dignity of every human life, from the very beginning, is unwavering. And it will continue to guide us in everything we do.”
The question of whether the cap on damages would apply in the case is still an issue for other defendants in the case, including Pella Regional Health Center.

Lawsuit stems from 2021 incident
The lawsuit involves the treatment provided to Miranda Anderson of Poweshiek County. Anderson was 34 weeks pregnant when, on April 13, 2021, she arrived at Pella Regional Health Center for evaluation due to elevated blood pressure, headaches and edema.
Citing concerns that she was experiencing preeclampsia — a condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby and may require early delivery — Anderson was transferred to MercyOne’s Obstetrics Emergency Unit via ambulance.
According to the lawsuit later filed by Anderson and her husband, Landen, Miranda Anderson was discharged after two days of monitoring and testing. After further evaluations over the course of the next several days, she was again discharged to her home — until, during an April 21 evaluation, her doctor was unable to detect any fetal heartbeat. The next day, she underwent a cesarean delivery of a nonviable baby girl, Eloise.
The Andersons’ lawsuit seeks damages for negligence, alleging CHI, MercyOne and its physicians failed to recommend early delivery of the baby while it was still viable and Anderson showed evidence of preeclampsia. The defendants have denied any wrongdoing.
Citing the state’s $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages in malpractice cases — a cap that was approved by state legislators in 2017 — the defendants have argued that while the cap on damages includes an exemption for cases that entail the “loss or impairment of mind or body,” that exemption should not apply to a case where a fetus or unborn child is lost.
They argue the Iowa Legislature did not intend for the loss of a baby prior to delivery to be included within the exemption. As evidence of this, they cite the fact that in 2023 — two years after the Anderson pregnancy — state lawmakers explicitly added “loss of pregnancy” to the exemption on the cap for damages.
Attorneys for Anderson argue the 2023 change was enacted merely to clarify the scope of the 2017 statute, not to expand the exemption on the caps for damages.
The case is scheduled for trial on May 12, 2025.
At Friday’s hearing, Beattie indicated he will rule on the question of damages, as well as other unresolved pretrial disputes, as quickly as possible.

“My good colleague from the 51st district parked in two spots, including mine, to make sure no one hit his fancy car. I Saran wrapped it to give it an extra layer of protection,” Brixie said in a statement to media outlets.
Maddock had been given two parking spots in the garage as he normally drives a large truck, Gideon D’Assandro, spokesman for Republican House Speaker Matt Hall said in a statement. However on Thursday, Maddock drove a different car and parked it between one of his spots and Brixie’s.

Michigan Information & Research Service posted photos early in the day of Maddock’s plastic-wrapped car, featuring his MMADD vanity plate.
Maddock reacted to the incident on the social media platform X throughout the day saying security footage would be released to the police this week, adding Brixie “keeps trying to get my attention and I keep telling her im married.”
Maddock’s wife, former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Meshawn Maddock, chided Brixie on X for saying that the car her husband had taken to work, which was her car, had the engine running and hood open, when in reality she had tampered with it.
“Rep Brixie makes a false statement otherwise known as a LIE in the presence of the entire Michigan House, after wrapping my car in plastic wrap like a 13 year old girl. Democrats arent just soft on crime, like Brixie, they are crime,” Meshawn Maddock wrote.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-18 20:56:39+00:00,CT Mirror,"For $2.4 billion, this bill aims to lower CT electric bills. Why are both parties split?",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/18/ct-electric-rates-2025-bill/,"The bill, raised by Sen. John Fonfara, would have CT borrow $2.4B over the next three years to pay off a chunk of residents’ electric bills.","Following months of public angst over Connecticut’s high energy prices, both Republicans and Democrats this week rallied behind what many saw as an audacious proposal: Have the state borrow $2.4 billion over the next three years to pay off a chunk of its residents’ electric bills.
The proposal, Senate Bill 1560, is the work of state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, a veteran lawmaker who serves as co-chair of the legislature’s Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
During a press conference Wednesday, where he was flanked by leaders from both parties, Fonfara said his bill would immediately cut electric costs up to 20% by removing the controversial public benefits charge from customers’ bills and paying for it through state-issued bonds. The public benefits charge covers the cost of state-mandated energy-efficiency programs, clean energy investments and support for low-income ratepayers.
Additional provisions of the bill would save ratepayers even more in the long run, Fonfara said. Those include revamping the process through which the utilities purchase power for their customers, mandating variable time-of-use electric rates, eliminating certain solar credits and the sales tax on electricity bought by commercial and industrial users, along with other changes. The combined savings could be as much as 40% of customers’ current bills, the senator said.
“There are certain fundamental truths that we must acknowledge and act on if we want to reverse the path we are on,” Fonfara said. “If we choose to do nothing, electricity costs will continue to increase.”
Almost immediately, however, members of both parties began to question Fonfara’s promises of savings and the wisdom of borrowing what would amount to nearly one-third of the state’s annual bond cap — which is currently $2.5 billion — exclusively for this purpose.
Others pointed out that Fonfara is at the center of controversy surrounding a deal with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office to place him on a vacant seat at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, which is in charge of approving electric rates. After that deal was announced last month, press reports revealed that Fonfara owned a company which racked up more than $1 million in fines and late fees from PURA.
In a statement released Tuesday, a spokesman for Lamont said the governor was open to considering some aspects of the bill such as improving the energy procurement process and addressing variable demand for electricity at different times of day.
But the spokesman, Rob Blanchard, made it clear that the governor does not view the creation of a new government entity or more borrowing as viable solutions to the state’s energy affordability issues.
“Rather than putting annual expenses on our ‘credit card’ or crowding out bonding for municipal parks, roads, and school construction with items in the public benefits charge, as proposed, the Governor would prefer we explore ways to reduce [public benefits] charges that may be outdated or unnecessary,” Blanchard said in his statement.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, was similarly skeptical of the amount of new debt proposed in the bill and whether it would be paid back with taxpayer funds or revenues drawn from utility bills.
“If there’s state general fund contributions, we can’t afford it,” Ritter said. “If it’s something about the ratepayers paying it back over 30 years as opposed to three, I mean, I’d look at that.” 
Despite those concerns, the bill gained traction this week with the backing of a bipartisan slate of key lawmakers including Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, and House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford.
Candelora said that his caucus had been discussing the bill with Fonfara over the last six or eight weeks. In March, Republicans were angered when Democrats on the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee opted not to go forward with any of the Republicans’ proposals to reduce residents’ electricity bills.
“This piece of legislation does that, and we look forward to that bipartisan conversation that is so needed to try to address the concerns of our business community and our residents and the impacts that high electric costs have had on the state of Connecticut,” Candelora said.
Fonfara has until April 24 to schedule a vote to advance his bill out of the committee he chairs. 
Utilities weigh in
In his comments to the press Wednesday, Fonfara outlined two key pillars of his legislation that he said would work to reduce electricity costs.
First, it would remove portions of public benefits charge from customers’ bills and shift those costs onto the state through new bonds issued over the next three years. Those bonds would be capped at $800 million a year, for a total of $2.4 billion.
Secondly, the legislation would create a new quasi-public agency known as the Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority that would be work with electric utilities, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and local electric cooperatives to create a new method of purchasing electric power supply at lower rates for customers. 
The switch, Fonfara said, would in essence take the utilities’ job of buying power and turn it over to public officials who could work year-round to find the best deals on wholesale electric market, rather than than the competitive auctions the utilities currently participate in twice a year.
“The utilities are being taken out of the procurement business,” Fonfara said. “They’re going to say ‘thank you,’ because it’s a thankless job for them. They make no money on it. They get criticized when rates go up and they don’t get any recognition when rates go down. I’m no apologist for them, but that’s the reality.”

Under Connecticut’s deregulated energy system, customers’ bills are split into four parts: the cost to procure power supply, the transmission and distribution of that power and a public benefits charge.
The utilities must pass on their supply and public benefit program costs to their customers without any markup. The companies earn profits only on the transmission and distribution of the that electricity.
During a public hearing on the bill Wednesday, representatives from United Illuminating and Eversource did, in fact, praise Fonfara’s legislation, which they said offered solutions to reduce customers’ bills while focusing on those areas where they don’t earn a profit. 
“We are hopeful that the concepts in this bill would turn into a reality where we would end up seeing some significant reductions in perhaps the supply charges and other areas that are meant for grid modernization,” said Christie Prescott, the director of wholesale power contracts at United Illuminating. 
Both of the utilities also supported another provision in the bill that would limit the amount of credits that customers with solar panels could earn on their bill by sending excess power back into the grid.
As more customers install solar panels and purchase less electricity from the grid, utility officials said the cost to maintain transmission wires, utility poles and other infrastructure has shifted onto customers without solar panels. The amount of electricity Eversource sold to its customers last year — about 20,000 gigawatt hours — was roughly the same as in 1993, according to data presented to lawmakers from the utility. 
“We have this predicament and it’s not specific to Eversource,” said Doug Horton, the utility’s vice president for distribution rates & regulatory requirements. “The fact of the matter is that we have a declining sales base and a need to continue to invest in the system.”  
That same proposal, however, drew a sharp response from environmental advocates and the solar industry. Both groups said it would dismantle solar incentives while placing further strain onto the grid.
“Energy efficiency and solar have been essential for keeping costs down for customers, because you have to think about the investments in distribution and transmission systems that otherwise would of had to be made over the those 20 years,” said Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney for Save the Sound, a local environmental group. 
Other critics raised concerns that the cap of $800 million a year on the bonds would not be enough to cover the full cost of public benefit programs — which is currently more than $1 billion a year — leaving the future of those programs in doubt.
Claire Coleman, the head of the Office of Consumer Counsel that advocates on behalf of ratepayers, submitted written testimony to Fonfara’s committee stating that those costs can also shift largely from year to year, making it difficult for officials to know how much money they would have to borrow ahead of time to pay for the programs.  
“Even if it were permissible and the proposed bill was amended to increase the bonding limits to reflect the necessary expenditures, it is not clear that state bond process is best suited to fund the programs indicated in the proposed bill,” Coleman said.
Fonfara said the intent of the bill was to give ratepayers a three-year window of relief. Meanwhile, lawmakers, in conjunction with the new Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority, would determine whether the programs under the public benefits charge are necessary and whether the costs to run those programs should be borne by the state or by ratepayers through their electric bills. If they’re determined not to be necessary, he said lawmakers could opt to discontinue them.
“That’s for the legislature to decide,” he said. “But it will be a prudent decision, with a lot more information.”
Party infighting
The top two Democrats in the Senate, Looney and Duff, had previously pledged their support for another bill addressing electric prices — Senate Bill 4 — that is still being drafted by members of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. When asked during Wednesday’s press conference whether the Fonfara legislation had supplanted that effort, Looney said there was no competition between the two bills.
“Eventually, they will all go into the hopper and provide something that I think the people of Connecticut will recognize as a legitimate response to the crisis that we face,” Looney said.
Within a matter of hours, however, tensions between the two committees and their leaders flared into the open.
About midway through Wednesday’s hearing, Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, the leader of the Energy and Technology Committee, began questioning Horton, the Eversource executive, about a section of the bill dealing with the securitization of storm costs that he said closely resembled a proposal pitched by the utility following Tropical Storm Isaias in 2020. “I just want to be clear where a lot of this comes from,” Needleman asked, when Fonfara interjected.
“Senator, where it comes from is this person right here, it’s my bill,” Fonfara said. 
After more back-and-forth with Horton, Fonfara eventually cut off Needleman’s line of questioning saying that he had surpassed the committee’s five-minute time limit.
“I hope this bill comes to our committee where it belongs and we have a robust conversation about this,” Needleman responded. “This is not the way to solve these problems.”
When asked later about the spat, Looney issued a statement through a spokesman saying that such disagreements are part of the normal legislative process. 
“Forging consensus is a difficult process, but one that is necessary for any bill to become law,” Looney said. “Sometimes we do not know how issues will be framed and resolved until late in the session, whether they are merged into one bill, run separately, or have elements combined into a different vehicle altogether. Unlike the Republicans, we are not free to merely complain and offer unworkable pie-in-the-sky proposals.”

Candelora, the House Republican leader, blamed Needleman’s committee for blocking a number of proposals put forward by Republicans, including a plan that would have made the public benefits charge an annual expense, paid for out of the state’s budget. 
Speaking to a reporter later, Candelora clarified his support of Fonfara’s bill as “a work in progress,” and said he believes some public benefits programs, such as funding for electric vehicle charging stations, are appropriate bonding expenses while others should be budgeted for.
“What has been frustrating about this entire process is that you have a completely dysfunctional energy committee that has made all of these issues highly partisan and highly toxic,” Candelora said.
No Senate Republicans were present at Wednesday’s press conference with Fonfara. The day before, members of that caucus publicly accused Fonfara, their fellow senator, of being complicit in a scheme to provide political support for Lamont’s reappointment of PURA Chair Marissa Gillett in exchange for a job as one of five commissioners at the authority.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, told reporters he believed that deal likely violated the state’s bribery statutes. But in the same press conference, Harding did not discount the idea of working with Fonfara on energy policy.
“We will do anything possible to reduce people’s electric bills in the state of Connecticut,” Harding said. “We don’t care who we have to work with.”
Later in the week, Harding and a top Republican on the Energy and Technology Committee, Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, said there are “several concerning aspects” of S.B. 1560 and that they would not support the bill in its current form. 
Specifically, Fazio said that Fonfara’s proposed Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority would have overlapping duties with existing state agencies. He also said a proposed fund administered by that authority to adopt smart metering technology and other infrastructure upgrades would result in the creation of what he called a “mini public benefits charge” that would still appear on electric bills.
Still, Harding and Fazio said they welcomed Fonfara’s efforts to address the issue.
Harding said he, too, was concerned with the creation of the new quasi-public authority, which he said he sees as a potential landing ground for Fonfara amid the scrutiny into the senator’s bid to obtain a seat on PURA. “It is quite suspect,” he said.
Tom Swan, the executive director of Connecticut Citizen Action Group, called Fonfara’s promises to save residents money “horribly dishonest,” and he said he thinks the legislation raises several “ethical red flags,” given the senator’s business ventures in the energy industry.
“There is absolutely no trust for Sen. Fonfara to be playing a role in this,” Swan said.
Fonfara told reporters on Wednesday that he has no interest in serving on the new authority. He did not respond to additional requests for comment about the legislation this week. 
A third bill addressing electric prices, drafted by members of the Government Administration and Elections Committee last month, would have prohibited Eversource and United Illuminating from owning both electric and gas utilities, and it imposed new qualification requirements for members of PURA’s board. Ritter, the House speaker, said this week he does not expect that legislation to move forward.
“That was not rightfully raised, and it will crumble,” Ritter said. 
But with respect to the other two bills, Ritter said both have the potential to produce worthwhile ideas. “I think you have two major pieces of energy legislation: S.B. 4 and Sen. Fonfara’s bill,” he said. “My thing would be, let’s put them all together and get a great bill.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4441-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

The Utah Lt. Governor’s Office earned the commission’s 2024 Clearinghouse Award for distinguished voter education initiatives and the Salt Lake County Clerk Election Division won for best practices for improving accessibility for voters with disabilities. 
Salt Lake County’s “Try Before You Vote: Accessible Vote Outreach” program earned it a spot on the list. With the initiative, the county’s election division offered live demonstrations of voting equipment and other resources at events for individuals with disabilities, allowing them to test out the tools, ask questions and register to vote.

“This outreach was all about meeting voters where they are,” Salt Lake County Clerk Lannie Chapman said in a news release. “We know that confidence and familiarity are key to participation, especially for voters with disabilities. Our team is proud to be recognized for helping make the voting process more accessible, approachable, and inclusive for everyone in our community.”
The election division wrote in its award entry that the program substantially increased confidence and participation in the election process. It also had benefits for election officials by “reducing the need for last-minute accommodations and increasing overall efficiency.”  
The lieutenant governor’s office earned its award for its “12 Days of Election Improvements,” or “Votemas,” a social media campaign nodding to “12 Days of Christmas” traditions, highlighting new voting technologies, procedures and laws in Utah elections. 
“While election-related posts tend to flood social media in the weeks leading up to Election Day, after the dust settles, it’s easy for people to forget that election work continues year-round.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Christina Gill says life continues after losing someone to gun violence, but the pain remains and her experience of joy is different.
Gill lost her 39-year-old son Joseph Aieloo on Oct. 4, 2021, after Jay Wagers, 29, shot him in the Santa Fe neighborhood where Aieloo grew up.
Gill, a member of Moms Demand Action, said she still lives in that same neighborhood, because her son was such a dynamic person “there’s no place I can go in Santa Fe that I’m not reminded of his presence.”
Gill spoke on Wednesday morning at an event organized by New Mexico Democrat U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich’s office outside of Robert F. Kennedy Charter School’s middle school campus just outside the Albuquerque city limits, near the South Valley. They were joined by students from the middle school, from the advocacy organization Students Demand Action, and from ACE Leadership High School.
A week earlier, Heinrich re-introduced two pieces of legislation in Congress intended to address gun violence: the GOSAFE Act, which would regulate the sale, transfer and manufacture of gas-operated semi-automatic firearms; and the BUMP Act, which would ban the sale of “bump stocks” and other devices or modifications that convert semi-automatic firearms into fully automatic ones.
“It is not only our right but our duty to advocate for gun safety laws,” Gill said. “I ask you to stand with me today in urging our legislators to pass GOSAFE, to protect our communities and children from the tragedy of gun violence, to protect not just the rights of those who champion the Second Amendment, but to acknowledge their duty as elected officials to pass legislation that protects the equal rights of all of their constituents, especially children, to feel safe in our communities.”
Heinrich said Wednesday that the previous assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, prohibited things that were “purely cosmetic,” while the true deadliness of some firearms comes from the mechanisms they use to quickly load a new round after firing the first one.
“It won’t change things overnight but it would move us on a trajectory where there would be far fewer of these weapons of war on the streets over time,” he said.
Gill said Heinrich’s legislation targets particular and especially lethal gas-operated semi-automatic firearms, leaving numerous options for people to buy other kinds of guns to hunt, compete or protect their families
The legislation would require that if a firearm is gas-operated — meaning it uses the gas expended by the first fired round to quickly cycle the firing mechanism and load the next one — it must have a magazine that is not detachable and only holds 10 rounds, Heinrich said.
“We know time and time again that the moment that these mass shootings actually come to an end is when the shooter has to stop, take stock and get reloaded without being able to just slide another high-capacity magazine in,” Heinrich said.
Ken Jones, a hunter and firearm owner, said large magazines are not needed for target practice or self-defense.
“To solve the gun crisis in our country today, in my opinion …we need to have better access to mental health care, we need strong red flag laws and yes, we need to keep the most violent criminals off our streets and out of our communities,” Jones said.
Monicia Henley, senior vice president of corporate affairs with Everytown for Gun Safety, said Heinrich’s bill will prevent more mass shootings, and she called on his colleagues in Congress along with New Mexico state lawmakers to join him.
“This isn’t about taking away our rights, it’s about saving lives,” Henley said. “We need to make a special session happen in Santa Fe, and focus on preventative measures that will save lives.”
Miranda Viscoli, co-president of New Mexicans to Prevent Gun Violence, said Heinrich’s legislation represents “the first critical steps to remove weapons of war from our civilian population, weapons that never should have been available to any of us in the first place.”

‘My life would be different’
Gill on Wednesday talked about the other people who were hurt in the shooting that killed her son, and the people left to live with his absence.
She said he volunteered for tenant advocacy group Chainbreaker Collective, she said.
“He helped people get off the street,” she said. “He really cared about people who are marginalized. So I am much more empathetic and compassionate as a result of this loss in understanding why he cared so much for people who struggled.”
Gill said Wagers “went on a rampage,” shooting another random victim through the eye who survived with permanent brain damage, injuring another with shattered glass and traumatizing two more people by barely missing them with bullets.
Wagers ultimately pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Aieloo’s shooting death, and also pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder; two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; and shooting from a vehicle in the same incident. A state district court judge sentenced him to 30 years in prison.
Gill read from 15-year-old Landon Garcia’s victim impact statement in the case.
“Joey was, and still is, a very important person in my life,” Garcia wrote. “The night I found out he died, I bawled my eyes out. I cried and cried. He was one of my role models and my friend. If this man would not have murdered him, my life would be different.”
Gill told reporters that it’s her duty to do anything that might prevent a similar tragedy from affecting anyone else.
“I stand here for my son, all the Landons and community members, families and friends whose lives would be different if not for the devastation of gun violence,” Gill said. “We’re always going to have conflict, but it doesn’t mean we have to have violence.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250418_141509-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

It has been edited for length and clarity.
You can also listen to a version of this interview on our new podcast The Light Switch.
Piper Hutchinson: What do you think is coming for higher education this session? 
Rick Gallot: I think certainly starting with a standstill budget is always better than starting with a proposed cut. So, you know, we’re certainly very grateful for that. I think there’s a lot of uncertainty, coming out of Washington and with the constitutional amendments that did not pass, obviously that has created some angst in terms of what do we do now, right? And so I think there is, again, just an overall level of uncertainty that we’ll see it … kind of play out over time. 
I think if you look at the increased revenue from the sales, sales taxes and other things, we’re certainly not in a real bad spot right now as a state in terms of our finances. So I’m still optimistic that we will work through the challenges in the session, and we will come out good on the other side. 
Hutchinson: Looking at the bills that we have so far, what do you think is going to be the most impactful for higher education?
Gallot: It’s hard to say, and when you look at what’s filed versus what ultimately makes it through the process; all bills filed on the front end don’t always make it. Rep. (Emily) Chenevert has come back with another diversity, equity and inclusion bill. We will certainly have to see how that plays out. The bill she had last year started one way and ended up another. … Certainly with all other higher ed leaders, she was very receptive to meeting with us and working through some of those challenges last year. At the end of the day, I think the budget is always going to be the main focus that could impact the trajectory going forward.
Hutchinson: There’s one bill that’s going to have a big impact for your system, talking about transferring UNO back to the LSU System. What should we expect on that front? 
Gallot: For me personally, it’s a full-circle moment. I was in the house when UNO was transferred from LSU to the University of Louisiana System. You know, I just want what’s best for the students, for the campus community at the University of New Orleans. It is a legislative prerogative. They have the authority to transfer universities from one system to the other. So if this legislation is successful, we will certainly do our part to ensure that it is a seamless transition. We will work with LSU, with Board of Regents and with the legislature to ensure that the transition is as smooth as it could possibly be. 
Hutchinson: What’s that like for you [as a former legislator] during the legislative session, being kind of outside the rails?
Gallot: Well, I certainly have a lot of respect for our legislators and the sacrifices they all make in serving. I’m a huge fan of Stephen Covey’s “Seven Habits,” and one of those is: “Seek, first to understand then to be understood.” And so I think that’s helpful to understand the pressures that our legislators are under, knowing that there’s a lot that they have to balance. I think it’s helpful, quite frankly. And I don’t think I burned any bridges while here. 
I mean, I did oversee redistricting, so maybe I did [burn] one or two. But for the most part, I still have good relationships with many of my former colleagues … who are still there. I’m grateful to have the opportunity to be a part of the process but from this side. 
Hutchinson: There has been a little bit of controversy in the LSU System lately, that’s reignited these conversations about curbing tenure. What are you hearing on that front, and what would that mean for higher education as a whole if they did take an axe to tenure? 
Gallot: Going back to COVID, and you think about faculty members, who go through the process of, not only a bachelor’s and a master’s and a terminal degree. You know, they get hired, they’re on a tenure track, they’re researching, they’re writing, they’re building their portfolio, and at the appropriate time they apply for tenure. I think we have to respect that process. 
I think it is one that is deeply rooted in higher education, and so I think we certainly have to respect faculty and that they have earned this. 
Now, having said that, it’s always one or two bad apples that will spoil the barrel, as they say. I don’t know that simply doing away with tenure is the answer. 
If the legislature passes something, then we, as a state system, will certainly abide by whatever changes may be made. I think we want accountability at all levels, that we want our students to be in the best position to learn. We want our faculty to be in the best position to teach, and that our students would graduate and go out and make a difference in society. So we’ll certainly be watching it closely, and hopefully we will see thoughtful debate throughout the process. And again, with whatever the ultimate result is, we will work with it.
Hutchinson: I can’t not talk about what’s going on at the federal level. We’re talking about cutting research funding. There are concerns about immigration and graduate students, and certainly tariffs could increase expenses for higher education. How is the UL System adapting to all of this? 
Gallot: Right now there’s so much uncertainty just across the board. Whether it’s the potential loss of research funding and indirect cost, for instance, universities build their budgets based upon what they believe the revenue stream will be from these research grants. I’m hopeful that we will sort of get through this period of uncertainty, and we will see things sort of settle down to be a little more predictable. But you know, at the same time, we will have to adjust if the rules are changed. If the funding formulas are changed, we will just have to adapt. We always have and we always will.

(Courtesy NPS)More than 85,000 out-of-state hunters descend on the Treasure State each year for the chance to take a shot at a Montana elk, antelope, bear or bird.
To pay for that opportunity, they fork over $15 as a base license fee, in addition to buying a tag — ranging from $5.50 for a college student migratory bird license to $1,250 for a moose or bighorn sheep. 
But the Montana Legislature has approved a bill that will increase the base license fee for nonresidents to $100 — a 566% increase. 
The change is expected to bring in an additional $7.2 million in revenue according to the bill’s fiscal note, of which $6.8 million will be allocated to the state’s block management program. 
“The idea of identifying these dollars to go to block management is a concerted effort to try to open up more lands for the public in Montana,” sponsor and Rep. Gary Parry, R-Colstrip, told the House Fish Wildlife and Parks Committee earlier this session. 
The state’s block management program was developed 40 years ago as a way to increase access to private land and isolated parcels of public land through voluntary contracts with private landowners. It provides financial incentives for landowners to allow hunters on their property. 
Between 2001 and 2011, land owners enrolled more than 8 million acres in the program, earning up to $12,000 from enrollment fees and compensation based on hunter-day counts. Since 2011, the number of acres enrolled has steadily declined, despite efforts by the state to bolster the program by increasing the compensation cap for landowners to $25,000 in 2021 and $50,000 in 2023. 
In 2024, 1,314 landowners enrolled fewer than 7 million acres costing Montana FWP more than $12 million. 
Boosting payments could be a way for the department to offer more incentives for landowners to participate in the program, according to Quentin Kujala, FWP chief of conservation policy. 
Kujala told lawmakers at a House committee hearing that the staff who work on block management say the biggest reason for loss of access in the program is land sales, and while there are many motivations for selling land, money is certainly a factor. 
Opposition to Parry’s bill came from the Montana Outfitters and Guides Association, where one lobbyist, Scott Boulanger, said the increase was “drastic.” Representatives of the outfitters association told lawmakers that they would support a more modest increase to $50.
But Frank Szollosi, with the Montana Wildlife Federation, told Senate lawmakers that surrounding states already charge much higher rates for nonresident hunters.
In Idaho, nonresident hunting licenses cost $185; in Utah they cost $144, and in Oregon, $160. 
“We’ve got better hunting than they do,” Szollosi said. 
Wyoming is similar to Montana, charging nonresident hunters a base application fee of $15, and a bill introduced to the legislature earlier this year seeking to increase that to $75 did not advance. 
Parry said that $100 fee is “lint in the pocket” for many out-of-state hunters, who come specifically for the state’s big game and often are hiring outfitters and guides, as well as spending money on their travels to the state to begin with. 
“These folks do come here to hunt in our places. If it’s too much, they can stay in their own states. We need to look out for the people of Montana, and this bill pushes that forward.”
The bill is headed to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/51326841831_adf49d4ff0_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

The news was first reported by The Providence Journal, and confirmed to Rhode Island Current Friday afternoon by Greg Paré, a spokesperson for Ruggerio.
Paré was unable to confirm what date Ruggerio was readmitted to Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, but said it was due to a reaction to a treatment he was undergoing for his cancer diagnosis.
“They’re working to help him regain his health,” Paré said.
Senate President Ruggerio takes more time off to focus on ‘rebuilding his strength’

The news comes five weeks after Ruggerio, 76, was last released from the same hospital’s rehabilitation center after a bout with pneumonia. The North Providence Democrat has been absent for a majority of the 2025 sessions, attending just four of the 17 regularly scheduled Senate gatherings since January. He last presided over the chamber’s regular session on March 25. Ruggerio declined recent interview requests about his health, though Pare said he was doing better, with plans to focus on “rebuilding his strength” ahead of the final stretch of the session.
An email sent from Ruggerio’s Senate email address to lawmakers at 1:39 p.m. Friday, and obtained by Rhode Island Current, stressed the need for the chamber to address the primary care doctor shortage, noting recent actions by insurance companies and Gov. Dan McKee. The email is signed “Donny, Val and David,” referring to Ruggerio, Sen. Majority Leader Val Lawson and Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian. 
Less than 90 minutes later, Paré sent another email to senators letting them know Ruggerio was back in the hospital ahead of the news being publicly reported.
Ruggerio originally planned to return to the chamber following its April recess this week. Paré was unsure when asked Friday whether that was still the plan, given his hospitalization. 
Additional information regarding his condition from Fatima hospital was not immediately available.

(Photo by Ruth Conniff/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction rejected the Trump administration’s request to certify compliance with a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion in K-12 public schools. 
State Superintendent Jill Underly said in a statement that Wisconsin schools are following the law. 
“We’ve put that into writing to the USDE,” Underly said. “We believe in local control in Wisconsin and trusting our local leaders – superintendents, principals, educators – who work together with parents and families every day to support students. They know their communities best. Washington, D.C. should not dictate how schools educate their kids.” 
The U.S. Department of Education sent a letter earlier this month to state agencies across the country requesting that agencies check with local school districts to ensure they don’t have diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. 
The federal administration is trying to apply the U.S. Supreme Court’s Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard decision, which said race-based programs in higher education violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, to K-12 education. The administration said state agencies needed to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Supreme Court decision. 
Wisconsin is one of several states, mostly led by Democrats, that have pushed back on the request. The Trump administration, which has been targeting diversity efforts in K-12 schools as well as in higher education and other sectors, has threatened that it could pull funding from states that don’t comply with the request.
Wisconsin schools receive $841.9 million from the federal government, making up about 8% of the total funding for schools across the state. Funding from the Department of Education makes up $568.2 million of that, and according to DPI, this is equivalent to 6,106 educator jobs. 
According to the letter, DPI provided the Department of Education with copies of previous certifications of compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
The agency said that its repeated requests for additional information about the new certification request went unanswered. In an April 9 letter, DPI asked for clarification on why the federal government was requesting another certification and asked the Department of Education to answer questions including whether the requested certification seeks to enforce any requirement beyond what is required by federal law and regulation and what legal authority the Education Department is using to make the request a condition of federal aid. 
“If the certified assurances are insufficient to meet the conditions of federal funding imposed by USDE, please articulate the basis in law for imposing these conditions, as well as an explanation as to why these assurances do not fulfill those requirements,” DPI General Counsel Benjamin Jones wrote to the Department of Education.
Underly said the new certification is a way for the federal government to “directly control the decisions in our schools by conditioning federal dollars. This is a serious concern – not just for the DPI, but for anyone who believes in lawful, transparent government.”

Goodwine reflected on her life of overcoming obstacles when speaking Friday, and promised to carry “the importance of faith and education and perseverance” with her in the future. 
Trailblazer: A conversation with Kentucky Supreme Court Justice-elect Pamela Goodwine

“I always say I don’t give up on my dreams when life gets hard, I simply work harder to make my dreams come true,” she said. “If there is one philosophy and action I would like to be known for and for you all to recognize and live by as well, that is it. No matter what life brings your way, keep dreaming, keep working for your goals.” 
Goodwine spent time in foster care as an infant and was later adopted by her foster parents, the Lantern previously reported. The Youngstown, Ohio, native and high school valedictorian gave up a college scholarship to support her adoptive father who was dying of lung cancer. About six months after her father was diagnosed, he died. After his death, his brother killed her mother. 
At 24, she was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, an incurable bowel inflammation condition that can be painful and disruptive to life. After that diagnosis, she spent two  months hospitalized and had to re-learn how to eat and walk. 
She began working in the courts  as a legal secretary and court stenographer. She earned undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Kentucky and in 1994 entered private practice with the firm Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs until her appointment to the district court bench in 1999. Goodwine won her circuit judge seat in 2003. She became the first Black woman to serve on the Kentucky Court of Appeals after being elected in 2018.
“I have often been called a trailblazer,” Goodwine said. “More important than achieving any individual accomplishment, I have always believed that it is each of our responsibility to live and serve in ways that make the world a better place for generations that follow us.”

Praise for Goodwine 
During her investiture, Goodwine’s fellow justices praised her for her tenacious character and long career of firsts. They also applauded her for making history yet again in officially donning her Supreme Court robes and inspiring broader trust in the court
Justice Angela McCormick Bisig said race and gender aren’t usually part of the discussions justices have about cases on their docket. 
Reflecting on her mountain roots, Debra Lambert takes public oath as Kentucky’s chief justice

But, she said, “for this court to do that very important work, it is best to have all lived experiences and points of view at the table, because we can all strive to be compassionate and understanding, but we really can’t know what it’s like to be someone else.” 
Gov. Andy Beshear said Goodwine’s win is a “cause for celebration” but “it’s also a reminder of our reality, that nearly 250 years into the history of this great country, we are still recognizing firsts.” 
“Because of Justice Goodwine’s tenacity, pushing through personal tragedy, struggle and, yes, discrimination that still exists in our world, we are closer to the promise of our country that every child no matter their circumstances can dream of being a Kentucky Supreme Court justice,” Beshear said. “I’d like to thank her for making us a little bit better here in the commonwealth today.” 
Chief Justice Debra Lambert called Goodwine’s presence a “gift to our court” and “a reminder that the court should be principled and deliberate and deeply human.” 
While judicial races are nonpartisan, both Goodwine and her opponent received partisan support. Democrat Beshear’s political committees contributed $510,000 to help Goodwine win. Her donors also included former Democratic Govs. Steve Beshear and Paul Patton, as well as some Democrats in the legislature.
Goodwine won her race for the 5th District seat in November, becoming the first woman and fifth person in history to serve at every level of the judiciary. The Kentucky Supreme Court also has a majority of women now, for the first time ever. Goodwine’s investiture was originally scheduled for January but was delayed because of weather. 
During the ceremony, Fayette County District Judge Melissa Moore Murphy led the crowd in singing “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Black National Anthem.

She loved being a paraprofessional in the Montrose School District in southeastern South Dakota, but after nine years assisting teachers and students, she wanted to make a bigger impact.
“I felt limited,” Bartmann said. “A family trusts you with their child — whether you’re a paraprofessional or a teacher. But as a ‘para,’ you only assist them. I couldn’t make suggestions or make changes I thought would help them.”
A day after she made up her mind, but before she submitted her resignation, her district emailed her with an opportunity: the South Dakota Teacher Apprenticeship Pathway.
The 3-year-old state program allows full-time paraprofessionals to pursue a teaching degree online through Dakota State University in elementary or special education, or through Northern State University in secondary education at a steep discount while retaining their position.
The program’s mission is filling teaching vacancies in school districts across the state, which have worsened in recent years. More than 350 positions were unfilled in July 2024, weeks before the school year started, according to the Associated School Boards of South Dakota. There were 256 the same time in 2023, 225 in 2022 and 174 in 2021.










The solution was to identify a group of people who otherwise wouldn’t get into the profession who belong in it.


– South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joe Graves


South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joe Graves is optimistic that the apprenticeship program will help.
“I’m hoping this year, because we’ve already graduated seven out of the program and believe we might be able to see another 56 to 60 graduate this spring, that would take a large whack out of the shortage,” Graves said.
All seven graduates, including Bartmann, are working in classrooms as teachers or have contracts to begin teaching in a South Dakota school district in the fall.
The program does not contractually require graduates to stay in the teaching profession or in South Dakota. The assumption is that paraprofessionals who’ve worked in the profession for years care about the children in their school, and have built their lives in the community where they work. 
“The solution was to identify a group of people who otherwise wouldn’t get into the profession who belong in it,” Graves said.

The state Department of Education accepted Bartmann in its first cohort of 90 participants in 2023. Another 70 enrolled in the 2024 cohort. Up to 50 more will enroll in the next cohort this year.
Bartmann moved from the Montrose School District to the nearby Canistota School District in the fall to teach special education for fifth through seventh graders. She taught her students under an advanced teaching certificate before earning her degree in December.
Now she teaches 18 children. She works with two other special education teachers at the elementary and high school levels, and nine paraprofessionals.
Her background is a strength, since “paras are the heart” of special education. She knows the challenges paras face, and listens to them because she understands they see a different side of a student.
“I’m passionate about making sure that I’m fully taking care of a student emotionally and socially, while making sure I see them academically,” Bartmann said.
Graves, with the state Education Department, said the future of the program is uncertain. It was originally intended as a one-time effort, using $815,000 in federal funds and about $446,000 in state funds. 
The program launched its second cohort under the state Department of Labor and Regulation in 2024 due to demand after the Legislature appropriated $800,000 of state funds for the program. The second cohort cost another $410,000 in funding from the department and $9,000 from the federal government.

A spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor and Regulation said the third cohort will be funded with a combination of federal and state grants, though she said the exact amounts will be determined after the apprentices start their coursework. The federal funding will come from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Apprenticeship Building America grant. School districts pay $1,000 a year per employed apprentice.
If federal funding is cut, Graves said, the program would end or universities might take it over. The department lost $58,178 in funds last month intended for the program, after the federal Department of Education dissolved approved extensions of COVID relief funding. South Dakota lost more than $5 million intended for several education programs.
Graves questions whether the program should continue indefinitely, saying it could be abused to avoid a traditional, more expensive college education.
State cancels teacher trainings for new social studies standards due to federal funding cuts

Students are responsible for up to $1,000 a year in tuition, books and state assessments. Bartmann completed 81 credits of classes within 15 months, costing her a total of $1,500. Sometimes she took more than a full course load in a semester while working full time and raising one of her four children who’s still at home.
“I’d go to school, come home, stay up until 2 a.m. studying and doing homework, sleep until 6 a.m. and then go back to work,” Bartmann said. “Weekends were focused on studying to get done faster.”
Instead of discontinuing the program entirely, she wonders if it could be limited to paraprofessionals who’ve been in the field for a few years. Experienced paras would be less likely to use the pathway as an alternative to the traditional college courses, she said, and the people who would apply would be committed, yet could be financially limited and likely to have obligations — such as children — that might prevent them from pursuing a traditional degree.
Less than four months after earning her degree, Bartmann is already considering earning another degree or certification to improve her teaching. After most workdays, she walks through the school hallways, looking at the colorful student artwork on display and feeling grateful for the new life breathed into her career.
At 46, she has colleagues her age who’ve been teaching for two decades and are planning ahead for retirement.
“I have to pack all those years of experience and impact they made into the years I’ve got left,” Bartmann said. “I want to reach as many students as I can.”
 



 State efforts to address South Dakota’s teacher shortage

Aside from the Teacher Apprenticeship Pathway, the state Department of Education and school districts have made other investments to alleviate the teacher shortage in the state, according to Secretary Joe Graves. 
Paying student teachers and making them the teacher of record
South Dakota lawmakers and the governor approved $500,000 for the creation of a statewide student-teacher stipend program this session. The state Department of Education can use the money to provide grants of up to $5,000 per school district, for payment to one or more student-teachers. The program is intended to keep South Dakota school districts competitive with other states.
“Where you begin your teaching profession is often where you continue it,” Graves said.
School districts can also establish student teachers as the “teacher of record,” meaning the student is the main teacher for a classroom, developing lesson plans and instructing students. If a student teacher becomes the “teacher of record,” a district is required to pay them, Graves said. Student teachers who are paid and regarded as an official teacher of record, he added, are more likely to commit to the district after they graduate, Graves said.
Employing international teachers
School districts across the state are increasingly employing teachers from different countries under working visas. The state Department of Education offers an International Exchange Teacher Permit. About 50 public school districts had international teachers on staff in 2024, according to the department.
Setting a minimum teacher salary and mandating annual increased compensation
The department was a major player in passing legislation in 2024 requiring school districts to meet a minimum teacher salary and increase teacher compensation yearly based on increased funding in state aid.
“We saw immediately that a bunch of school districts moved their minimum teacher salary up, even though the requirement is not going into effect until next year,” Graves said.
Mentoring new teachers
The state department’s mentoring program connects a veteran educator to a new teacher to help guide them through challenges in their first few years of the profession. The first five years is “really the test,” Graves said. When new teachers are mentored, there’s a 15% increased chance they’ll stay within the profession.
Supporting a high school teaching career interest
Educators Rising is a career interest group working to entice high school students to become South Dakota educators. The group holds a “sign up day” similar to athletes for high school members dedicated to earning their teaching degree. The South Dakota Board of Regents approved a program last year to give high school students a jump-start toward their teaching degree by taking career-specific dual credit courses that will count toward a college degree and high school graduation.
Streamlining state reciprocity
Graves said the department has worked to streamline the teacher certification reciprocity process, getting out-of-state teachers employed at local school districts more quickly.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/591A9467-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 16:07:21.155793

(Photo provided by Wells County Emergency Management)The North Dakota Senate this week added funding to a budget bill to help communities that lost federal grants for infrastructure projects.
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, who introduced an amendment to House Bill 1577 on the Senate floor Thursday, said he’s noticed some “hiccups” involving federal fund distribution.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency canceled about $20 million in grants designated for North Dakota projects. The pulled federal grants announced earlier this month were from FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, designed to help state and local governments with projects that reduce risks to hazards.
Loss of $20 million in FEMA infrastructure grants ‘devastating’ to North Dakota communities

“They had gotten these grants and they were ready to build their projects and the money was pulled out from under them,” Magrum said.
The amended bill authorizes the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to issue up to $9.7 million in loans through the Department of Environmental Quality for wastewater projects affected by the funding cuts. Two wastewater projects that lost funding are a $7.8 million wastewater treatment project in Lincoln and a $1.9 million wastewater lagoon erosion project in Fessenden.
The bill directs the Department of Environmental Quality to seek state funding in 2027 to repay the loans. If federal funds are restored to the projects, the bill requires those funds to be used to pay back the loans.
The bill does not address the other FEMA grants that were cut, which included $7.1 million for a water intake project in Washburn. Lawmakers plan to add funding for the Washburn project in another bill, said Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, told lawmakers that backfilling the projects with state-backed loans is a major decision to help those communities. He pointed out that the state Department of Health and Human Services also lost federal funding that has not yet been replaced by the state.
“Get prepared for a special session because there will be a load of these,” Mathern said.
The bill also includes the option for the interim Legislative Management Committee to conduct a study on the potential creation of a wastewater project fund for the state. The study would be presented during the 2027 legislative session and include input from cities, counties, townships and water resource districts. The bill returns to the House.

Tony Evers after signing the 2023-25 budget bill with 51 partial vetoes on July 5, 2023. (Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)A split Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto in the last state budget extending school funding increases for an additional 400 years was within his constitutional powers. 
The executive partial veto powers granted in the Wisconsin State Constitution are uniquely expansive, though they have been limited in the past through Supreme Court decisions and constitutional amendments passed by the Legislature and approved by voters.
In the 2023-25 state budget bill, Evers used his partial veto power striking two digits and a dash from the years to extend the annual increases through 2425, saying the action would help provide ongoing financial support to schools. The initial bill had included a $325 increase to schools’ revenue limits for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years.
Justice Jill Karofsky wrote in a majority opinion that the partial veto was within the power given to Evers in the state constitution, which says “appropriation bills may be approved in whole or in part by the governor.”
“We uphold the 2023 partial vetoes, and in doing so we are acutely aware that a 400-year modification is both significant and attention-grabbing,” Karofsky wrote. “However, our constitution does not limit the governor’s partial veto power based on how much or how little the partial vetoes change policy, even when that change is considerable.”
The case challenging the partial veto was brought by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce on behalf of two Wisconsin taxpayers, Jeffery A. LeMieux, a retired professor, and David T. DeValk, a Fox Valley substitute teacher — arguing that the action was unconstitutional and undemocratic. 
WMC Executive Vice President of Government Relations Scott Manley said they were disappointed by the ruling, and that Evers “exceeded his authority at the expense of taxpayers, and now our great-great-great-great-grandchildren will still be paying the price for his reckless disregard for the law.”
Karofsky laid out several options that lawmakers could take if they want to address the issue further, including by addressing it in a future budget — such as the 2025-27 budget that is being worked on now, by passing a constitutional amendment or by drafting bills separate from appropriation bills to avoid the governor’s partial veto or trying to anticipate how the power might be used. 
Lawmakers have introduced a couple of proposed constitutional amendments. One, which passed last session, would bar the governor from using the veto power to create or increase any tax or fee. Another introduced in January would replace current language that says a partial veto may “not create a new word by rejecting individual letters in the words of the enrolled bill, and may not create a new sentence by combining parts of 2 or more sentences” to say the governor may “only reject one or more entire bill sections.” 
Those proposals have to pass in two consecutive sessions of the Legislature before they could go to voters for ratification. 
Karofsky wrote that the Court “takes no position regarding these measures. We merely outline them to illustrate legislative alternatives to the action before us.”
The three conservative justices on the Court slammed the majority opinion, saying that by upholding the veto the Court has given the executive the power to make law separately from legislators.
“How does a bill become a law?” Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote in the dissenting opinion. “According to the majority, one option looks like this: The legislature passes a bill in both houses and sends it to the governor. The governor then takes the collection of letters, numbers, and punctuation marks he receives from the legislature, crosses out whatever he pleases, and — presto! — out comes a new law never considered or passed by the legislature at all. And there you have it — a governor who can propose and enact law all on his own.” 
Hagedorn wrote that the majority’s opinion makes “a mockery of our constitutional order. This is a mess of this court’s making, and it is long past time for us to fix it.” 
In an opinion concurring with the majority, Justice Rebecca Dallet said the precedent set forth in other cases before the court have “emphasized that a partial veto may affirmatively change the policy of the original bill.” Dallet said that she is “open to revisiting” that, but “this case is not a ‘clear opportunity’ to do so.”
“Petitioners do not ask us to overturn any of our prior decisions, let alone reimagine completely our approach,” Dallet wrote. 
Republican leaders and Evers react to decision, upcoming budget
Republican leaders were critical of the decision, saying that the Court had granted the governor unchecked power and that the decision would lead to tax increases for Wisconsinites.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said that the decision was evidence of the Court being partisan and “should worry every Wisconsinite.” 
“Is any Wisconsin citizen surprised that the liberals on the Wisconsin Supreme Court are now a rubber stamp for liberal ally Tony Evers?” Vos asked. “The liberal Justices’ decision itself describes the effects of this decision as ‘significant and attention-grabbing.’ Modest words for a tortured reading of our Constitution that will hurt Wisconsin taxpayers for hundreds of years to come, all in the name of supporting their ally in the Governor’s office.”
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said that the Court “proved again that they will rule based on partisanship and politics rather than the rule of law” and that the veto was “an unprecedented overreach that will impact generations of Wisconsin taxpayers.”
Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said that the state cannot afford to provide money for the increases, calling it “wildly unrealistic” and “fiscally unsustainable,” and that increases would be felt by property taxpayers. 
The partial veto applied to increases to schools’ revenue limits, meaning that school districts will have more leeway to bring in funds through property taxes or state funds. The partial veto did not allocate additional state dollars for the increases, though lawmakers could decide to provide state funds for the increases. The partial veto also did not automatically mean school districts would raise taxes, though they would have the option.
Wisconsin has limited school districts’ ability to raise funds through property taxes since 1993. Schools originally received regular adjustments to their limits on an inflationary basis, but that was eliminated in 2009 and since then increases have relied on lawmakers or school districts going to taxpayers for permission to increase taxes.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s via property taxes or income taxes, this money is going to come out of the pockets of Wisconsinites from Tomahawk to Racine,” Felzkowski said. She called on Evers to “come to the table to find a solution to this problem that he created, otherwise average Wisconsinites will be forced to take on the financial burden that he has put on them.” 
Evers said in a statement that schools deserve “sustainable, dependable, and spendable state support and investment” and said the decision was great news.  
“For over a decade, the Legislature has failed to meet that important obligation. Importantly, this decision does not mean our work is done — far from it,” Evers said. “Today’s decision only further underscores the urgent need for Republican lawmakers to approve the K-12 investments I’ve proposed to ensure our kids and our schools have the resources they need now and into the future.”
Evers has called for an additional $3 billion in investments for the state’s K-12 schools, funded with the state’s $4 billion budget surplus. Lawmakers have said the decision would be influential in the shape of education funding in the 2025-27 state budget. 
Department of Public Instruction Superintendent Jill Underly echoed Evers’ sentiment, calling the decision a win.
“The broader need remains: real, usable investments in our schools. That means fair special education reimbursement, meeting the mental health needs of our kids, stronger support for our educators, and access to nutritious school meals at no cost for every child,” Underly said. “These priorities must be reflected in the upcoming state budget. Without meaningful investment and an aid commitment from our Legislature, the burden continues to fall on local property taxpayers.”

(Photo by Carmen Murillo/Getty Images)I am a retired public health nurse with 27 years experience in communicable disease surveillance. I hunted down scary diseases to prevent others from getting sick. I worked with dreaded diseases such as meningitis, tuberculosis, measles, and syphilis. I witnessed the suffering and death of infectious diseases. But good things happened, too. With awe and amazement, I watched vaccination programs eliminate common diseases.
When I became a nurse in 1982, the most common form of infant meningitis was from a bacteria called Haemophilis influenza type b, or HIB. HIB disease causes severe infections, hospitalizations and death. If the baby survived, they were often left with neurological problems. Introduced in 1987, the HIB vaccine virtually eliminated this condition. Medical schools lamented that their interns would complete their entire training without ever having the chance to treat a case of HIB meningitis! 
I worked in the Texas School for the Blind, which cared for children damaged by rubella. Mexico did not have the rubella vaccine until 1985. If contracted in the first sixteen weeks of pregnancy, rubella causes severe birth defects such as profound intellectual impairment, blindness and deafness. The kids I saw in Texas had microcephaly, or abnormally small heads. It marked me forever to sit in a room full of disabled children knowing it was only lack of political will which sealed their fate.
The public health laws are effective! School vaccination requirements have given us a society where we are not afraid of dying from a plague. Polio has become a distant memory in our grandparents lives. Congenital rubella is very rare. Measles was eradicated from the US in the year 2000.
But this can break down if we are not vigilant. Measles is burning through the country. We have handicapped ourselves by firing the people who respond to public health emergencies. We need epidemiologists and nurses on the ground coordinating efforts.
Success of public health victories means that people have forgotten the horrors of disease. No one has seen the lockjaw of tetanus, or infants choking from pertussis, or malformed skulls of congenital rubella. Our very success has opened the door to complacency. Parents are misled by conspiracy theorists. Pockets of susceptible populations combined with malpractice of cutting our essential public health programs puts our country in a precarious position. It is just a matter of time before measles comes to your day care, your school, your church.
This comes at a time when access to health care is being curtailed. Cuts to Medicaid will leave children and pregnant women uninsured. Rural hospitals will be forced to close. Clinics will be shuttered. Nursing Homes will be emptied. This administration is taking us backwards to an unkind past.
An example of what we should not do is from the state of Idaho. A new law prohibits publicly funded medical services to undocumented persons. The law forbids prenatal care, immunizations, and communicable disease testing to “illegals.” This is in direct contradiction to the guidelines of the CDC. The cruel law makes Idahoans less safe, and thereby, surrounding states such as Utah less safe.
By not immunizing everyone, you create a reservoir of susceptible people where measles can thrive. By prohibiting communicable disease testing, you hamstring public health investigators who seek out deadly diseases like tuberculosis. I was a TB nurse for eight years. We treated people who had been contagious for months before diagnosis. A single case of TB can infect hundreds of others. By refusing prenatal care, women can die from gestational diabetes or eclampsia, a dangerous complication of pregnancy. Idaho will have blood on its hands.
We need a coherent, comprehensive public health policy. The drastic cuts to the CDC, NIH, and the safety net programs will adversely affect us all. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has turned his back on expert advice of the public health pioneers who have wrought health victories that were unimaginable to our grandparents. We must demand that our legislators carry out their responsibility to provide essential services to their constituents.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hands.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 16:07:21.155793

The child’s vaccination status “has not yet been verified,” according to the press release.
The child, who is not a Missouri resident, was visiting Taney County and was diagnosed “soon after arrival,” Lisa Cox, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release. 
Taney County is in southwest Missouri, and its largest city is Branson. 
“Exposure is believed to be limited, and known contacts have been identified and contacted,” Cox said, adding that the state is supporting Taney County’s health department to investigate possible exposure. 
The case is “associated with recent international travel,” Cox said.
Measles is a highly-contagious virus the country declared eliminated 25 years ago, but that has resurged with falling vaccination rates. 
“For those unvaccinated or those unsure of their vaccination status, now is the time to review records and get caught up if needed,” Dr. George Turabelidze, state epidemiologist with DHSS, said in the press release.
The percent of Missouri kindergarteners fully vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella has declined over the last several years, from 95% in the 2019-2020 school year to 91% in the 2023-2024 school year, in public schools, per DHHS data. In private schools, the drop has been even larger, from 92% to 85% in the same period.
Nationally, there are at least 800 reported cases of measles across 25 states, according to Center for Disease Control data as of Friday. That doesn’t include Missouri’s case, Cox said, because the state received lab test results Thursday night, after the federal reporting deadline for this week. 
That is the highest number for a single year since 2019 and is still growing.
The majority of measles infections nationally have been reported in a West Texas outbreak. There have been two confirmed deaths, both in Texas. 
Kansas has reported 37 cases, possibly linked to the Texas outbreak.
There are outbreaks in Canada and Mexico, too, and several states have reported isolated cases as the result of international travel.
At the same time, the federal government has cut grant funding set aside for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services to encourage vaccinations, according to St. Louis Public Radio.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)A federal judge brought up the arrest in Leon County of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen born in Georgia, during a hearing Friday in which she extended her block of the new Florida immigration law until April 29.
U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams expressed frustration about the arrests of Lopez-Gomez and others, said an attorney representing the immigrants and groups suing the state.
At issue is Williams’ April 4 order temporarily barring enforcement of a law passed during a special session earlier this year making it a first-degree misdemeanor to illegally enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
A Florida Highway Patrol trooper’s arrest of Lopez-Gomez on Wednesday prompted national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reports that he was set to remain in jail because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had placed a 48-hour hold on him — even after a Leon County judge determined there had been no probable cause for the arrest.
Lopez-Gomez was released from Leon County jail on Thursday evening. The 20-year-old held his mother in a tight embrace and wept when they reunited.
“We appreciate that the federal courts have seen through this blatantly unconstitutional law, but the reality is that, without enforcement, it seems that local law enforcement and Florida Highway Patrol are continuing to ignore the judge and order,” said Miriam Fahsi Haskell, an attorney for Community Justice Project representing the plaintiffs, in a phone interview with the Phoenix. “The reality is that once a person is arrested under SB 4C and booked into jail, that person risks then having an ICE hold on them.”
Community Justice Project, the ACLU of Florida, Americans for Immigrant Justice, and Florida Legal Services attorneys are representing the plaintiffs: the Florida Immigrant Coalition, Farmworker Association of Florida Inc., and two women without permanent legal status.
David Matthew Costello, lead attorney representing Attorney General James Uthmeier, declined to comment, and a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office did not respond to the Phoenix’s questions. The other defendants are the statewide prosecutor and state attorneys.
Binding?
During the hearing at the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida in Miami, attorneys representing the state argued that law enforcement is not bound by Williams’ order, Fahsi Haskell said. Another hearing is set for April 29.
“The Court enters a [temporary restraining order] prohibiting Defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person who are in active concert or participation with them from enforcing SB 4-C,” Williams’ order states.
Two other men were with Lopez-Gomez when the trooper stopped the car because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report. The driver, Estiven Sales-Perez, and another passenger, Ismael Sales-Luis, were also charged with illegal entry as “unauthorized aliens.” The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
ICE has taken custody of Sales-Perez and is holding him in a Tallahassee field office, according to the online detainee locator system.
“Florida Highway Patrol will continue to work willingly with our federal partners to engage in interior enforcement of immigration law,” a spokesperson for the agency wrote in a statement to the Phoenix.
Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried called the arrest a kidnapping.
“Where does the lawlessness of this administration stop? If this can happen to an American-born citizen, it can happen to any of us,” she said in a statement.

The Nebraska Department of Labor on Friday announced March’s 2.9% preliminary, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, noting that it tied Nebraska for the fifth-lowest unemployment rate in the country. The state’s unemployment rate, however, is up from the 2.6% reported a year ago for March 2024. 
Nebraska Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber, in a news release, said the state’s overall labor force reached a record high of over 1,080,000 in March.
“The number of employed workers in the labor force also reached a new high statewide, driven by record highs in the Omaha and Lincoln metro areas,” she said.

The number of employed and unemployed people in the labor force are based on a U.S. Census Bureau survey on employment status. Individuals who are claiming unemployment benefits and those who are not claiming the benefits can be counted as unemployed based on their survey responses.
Those not working or seeking a job are not considered part of the labor force and are not included in the unemployment rate calculation.
Labor data released Friday showed that Nebraska private industries with the most growth over last year were public education and health services and construction and mining.
Nationally, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for March inched up to 4.2%, compared to the February rate of 4.1% and 3.9% the year before in March 2024.
Nevada, with 5.7%, reported the highest unemployment rate, followed by the District of Columbia, Michigan and California.

Arkansas became the first state in the nation to prevent healthcare conglomerates from operating drugstores here when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 on Wednesday.
State law already regulates what pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) pay to reimburse independent pharmacies, but pharmacists have complained that the companies violate the law. The state has also fined four PBMs a total of $1.47 million for paying Arkansas pharmacies below the legally required amount for prescription drugs.
PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.
HB 1150 headed to Sanders’ desk April 9 after clearing the Senate with a bipartisan 26 votes, six days after it passed the House with 89 votes. The bill generated hours of discussion and public comment in the House and Senate committees on Insurance and Commerce this month.
“These massive corporations are attacking our state because we will be the first in the country to hold them accountable for their anticompetitive actions,” Sanders said in a statement Wednesday.
CVS Health issued a statement last week urging Sanders to veto HB 1150, calling it “misguided policy.” The organization, which includes the CVS Caremark PBM, issued another statement Wednesday afternoon.
“CVS Health welcomes a good faith discussion with policy makers in Arkansas and across the country on ways to make medicine more affordable and accessible,” the statement said. “Unfortunately, HB1150 is bad policy that accomplishes just the opposite: it will take away access to pharmacy care in local communities, hike prescription drug spending across the state by millions of dollars each year, and cost hundreds of Arkansans their jobs.”
Arkansas has 23 CVS pharmacies that CVS and other opponents of HB 1150 said will be forced to close under the new law. Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said this is not true and pharmacies can still operate if they detach from PBMs.
Sanders, Vinson and other supporters of HB 1150 have said a lack of sufficient regulation of PBMs has allowed them to monopolize the pharmaceutical industry by setting their competitors’ prices.
OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — the three largest PBMs — are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.
 
The legal landscape
 


Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018 prohibit PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their competitors, locally owned independent pharmacies. PBMs routinely break these laws, said Vinson and HB 1150’s Republican sponsors, Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton and Rep. Jeremiah Moore of Clarendon.
PBMs have allegedly also violated Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs. Pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) thousands of complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, independent pharmacists and AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year.
This led the Arkansas Legislative Council to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs. The panel approved the rule a day after its Administrative Rules subcommittee rejected it.
Hammer told the Senate Insurance committee April 8 that the Legislature should not be “rewarding” violators of state law “by letting them stay in business.”
“Congress is pursuing this issue. Why? Because states like Arkansas are not sitting on the sidelines and being quiet about it,” Hammer said. “[If you say], ‘Let’s sit back and wait for Congress,’ like sitting back and waiting for the Lord to come, it ain’t going to happen soon enough.”
After more than a century serving Hammer’s constituents in Benton, Smith-Caldwell Drug Store closed in August 2023 due to financial insolvency and transferred its clients to Walgreens, a national chain that isn’t part of a PBM.
Brad Lawson, a Little Rock-based healthcare supervisor for Walgreens, told lawmakers in December that unfair PBM reimbursements have forced the company to close several locations and plan further closures nationwide.
Walgreens declined to comment Thursday on HB 1150.
 Opposition

In an April 4 interview with the Advocate, CVS leaders said the Caremark PBM not only complies with Arkansas law but also reimburses independent pharmacies at a higher rate than its own chain pharmacies. They also said employers whose health insurance plans include CVS will face higher costs.
“Patients are choosing us, they have a choice, and I think we’re not allowing patients to have a choice in this bill,” Chief Pharmacy Officer Lucille Accetta said.
When asked about HB 1150’s potential financial impact on CVS, Accetta and Vice President of External Relations David Whitrap said the losses of pharmacists’ jobs and patients’ access to medication are higher priorities than money.
CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 and 900 more stores between 2021 and 2024.
CVS District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis spoke against the bill at both Insurance and Commerce committee meetings, saying she and her colleagues would lose their jobs if HB 1150 becomes law.
Ellis lives in Greenbrier, represented by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View. Irvin was in the minority of Senate committee members to vote against HB 1150, and she said she would not vote for a constituent to lose her job.
Hammer said the potential loss of CVS employees’ jobs is “a lie.”
“If they want to argue these local [corporate] pharmacies shouldn’t be going out of business because they get paid adequately, fine,” he said. “Put your money where your mouth is. Prove it. Start paying yourselves like you’re paying these others.”
Several lawmakers said this month that they supported HB 1150 partly because they received emails urging them to vote against it that appeared to be from constituents but turned out to be from lobbyists opposing the legislation. Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, told the House Insurance Committee that CVS clients in his district had not consented to their names being used for this purpose.
Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, told the equivalent Senate committee that he received similar misleading emails.
“This is not grassroots opposition to this bill,” Johnson said. “This is astroturf.”
Besides CVS Health, opponents of HB 1150 included the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, the Navitus Health Solutions PBM, and the Omnicare and Accredo pharmacies.
Omnicare is owned by CVS Health, and Accredo is a subsidiary of Express Scripts.
 Mail order concerns

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding.
Opponents of HB 1150 said it would reduce patients’ access to specialty drugs, some of which might only be accessible via mail-order services — including for military members and veterans who receive pharmaceuticals via the Tricare insurance program’s partnership with Express Scripts.
HB 1150 allows the State Board of Pharmacy to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Hammer told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.
Despite being a veteran on Tricare, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s pharmacy services have been moved from one provider to another by PBM interference, he said in January at a news conference announcing HB 1150. He also said he would defend the legislation in court if it were challenged.
On Monday, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in HB 1150 to be enacted federally.
Griffin sued Express Scripts and OptumRX last year, alleging that they used data from drug manufacturers and distributors to maximize their financial gain instead of using it to mitigate the opioid addiction epidemic.
 
‘Winners and losers’
 


Irvin was one of nine senators, mostly Republicans, to vote against HB 1150 last week. She disputed the claim that PBMs have a monopoly in the pharmaceutical industry, saying this is only an opinion without a court’s declaration.
Senate Minority Whip Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, was the chamber’s only Democrat to vote against the bill. Love’s district does not have any local independent pharmacies, and his constituents will lose access to medications if corporate pharmacies like CVS close, he said.
“They’ve been talking to me saying, ‘Guess what? This will hurt us,’” Love said. “So we’re going to manufacture a pharmacy desert in southwest Little Rock? That’s not good for my people.”
Irvin also took issue with a statement April 8 from Greg Reybold, vice president of Healthcare Policy at the American Pharmacy Cooperative, that HB 1150 will “take the ball away” from PBMs in Arkansas’ pharmacy industry.
“We’re using the government to say, ‘We’re getting rid of your competition,’” Irvin said. “…It says that we’re denying a permit to be approved for you, but not for you. You’re picking winners and losers.”
GOP Sen. Justin Boyd, a Fort Smith pharmacist and the vice chairman of the Senate Insurance committee, argued that PBMs’ ability to set their competitors’ prices is actually “picking winners and losers.”
Another 2025 Arkansas law that supporters said will increase patients’ access to medication is Act 52, which removed the state’s ban on nonprofit hospitals holding pharmacy permits. The bill, co-sponsored by Irvin, initially failed in the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee but later passed after being amended.
The Arkansas Pharmacists Association opposed Act 52 before it was amended. Vinson told the Senate Insurance committee that Act 52 will create new pharmacy jobs that could make up for any job loss brought about by HB 1150. Both laws will go into effect in August.

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — Opposing attorneys laid out starkly different portrayals Friday of campaign mailers sent during the 2020 election that a Nebraska legislative candidate alleged were defamatory and damaged her business, marriage and reputation.
The attorney for the candidate, Janet Palmtag of Nebraska City, told jurors during closing arguments that the Nebraska Republican Party showed a reckless disregard for the facts in sending out the fliers, which he said falsely stated that she had broken the law and lost her license to practice real estate.
The attorney, David Domina, asked jurors to award Palmtag $4.25 million for the loss of real estate listings and damage to her standing in her community and damage to her relationship with her family.

“Other than to call her names, there’s really no defense here,” Domina said.
The attorney for the Nebraska GOP portrayed the mailers as largely true and said the content had been checked against available public records. It was only later, lawyer Kamron Hasan said, that the party learned the back story about the disciplinary steps taken against Palmtag’s real estate firm by the Iowa Real Estate Commission.
He termed it “an honest mistake.”
“The First Amendment and free speech protects honest mistakes … it protects Democrats, it protects Republicans, it protects other political affiliations,” Hasan said.
The closing arguments came at the end of a weeklong trial in Lancaster County District Court over the defamation lawsuit filed by Palmtag against the Nebraska GOP.
A jury of seven men and four women (One juror didn’t return after being picked to serve.) must decide, by clear and convincing evidence, if the statements made in the campaign mailers were false, that the GOP knew they were false and published them with a reckless disregard for the truth.
Verdict as early as Friday
If the jury cannot reach a verdict by 4:30 p.m. Friday, deliberations will continue Monday, according to the trial judge, Lancaster County District Judge Andrew Jacobsen.
The case raises issues of how far political speech can go during a heated campaign and hinges on whether the political party issued the mailers recklessly or with malice, a legal term that essentially means intentionally.
Palmtag lost the 2020 race for the Nebraska Legislature in southeast Nebraska against the then-incumbent, State Sen. Julie Slama.
The race pitted two Republicans against each other, with Slama being backed by then-Gov. Pete Ricketts, who appointed Slama to her post, and the state party. Palmtag, a longtime state GOP volunteer, was supported by former Gov. Dave Heineman, then-U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, among others.
Palmtag filed her lawsuit three months after the election.
Testimony at trial indicated that Palmtag had called the then-executive director of the state GOP after the initial mailer was sent out on Oct. 8, 2020. The mailer stated that Palmtag had “broke the law” and “lost” her real estate license, which Palmtag said was a lie and needed to be corrected.

Instead, the GOP executive, Ryan Hamilton, refused and instead sent a second mailer to 3,200 households stating that Palmtag was “too irresponsible” to serve as a legislator. That piece cited a 2017 civil fine levied by the Iowa Real Estate Commission paid after one of Palmtag’s agents had failed to obtain all the required signatures for a transfer of an earnest deposit on the sale of a home.
Domina, during his closing argument, said the Nebraska GOP was “reckless” in the campaign flyer because Palmtag never “lost” her license — she voluntarily gave up her personal and the firm’s corporate licenses in 2019 due to a lack of Iowa business after flooding — and because her consent agreement with the Iowa commission admitted no violation of law.
“(The consent agreement) doesn’t end with a license revoked, suspended or lost,” he said. Palmtag and her firm were still in “good standing” for two years afterwards, when the licenses were not renewed, Domina said.
GOP says ads based on public documents
But, Hasan, the GOP attorney, told jurors that what the party sent out was “at least substantially true,” because the consent order read that Palmtag’s real estate firm, J.J. Palmtag, did not contest the “alleged violation” of Iowa law.
“It was a violation. The law was broken,” he said. “You don’t have to admit to being guilty of a crime for it to be true.”
Hasan said that when Hamilton looked up the status of J.J. Palmtag’s Iowa license in 2020, he found that it was listed as “canceled.”
“You don’t have to overthink this,” he told jurors. “Just read the words.”

But Domina said that if Hamilton had researched the Iowa commission’s website further, he would have discovered that Palmtag’s individual license had become “inactive” in 2019, and the company’s license had been listed as “canceled” because that’s how corporate licenses are listed when not renewed.
Palmtag, Domina said, only agreed to pay a $500 fine to resolve the matter, which she testified stemmed from a mistake by one of her salesmen, who was gravely ill.
Domina said Palmtag was being “responsible” for resolving the matter, calling it “preposterous” that she had been “irresponsible” as claimed by the GOP.
Hasan, meanwhile, said that as the supervising agent, it was her mistake that caused the fine.
“Janet is J.J. Palmtag and J.J. Palmtag is Janet,” he said.
The case took so long to get to trial because initially, the judge had granted a summary judgment filed by the GOP, thus dismissing the case.
Domina appealed to the Nebraska Supreme Court, which ruled in his favor that a jury, and not the judge, needed to make that decision, which led to this week’s trial.
This is a developing story.

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Earlier this week, health officials urged parents to consider seeking one dose of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine for infants aged 6-11 months who live in Doña Ana County — the fourth and latest New Mexico county with cases — or who will be traveling to either Doña Ana or Lea counties, where the bulk of the state’s cases have thus far taken place. 
Normally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  recommends infants receive the first dose at 12 to 15 months and a second dose between 4 to 6-years old. Dr. Jana Shaw, a State University of New York professor of pediatrics, notes that babies gain some antibodies from measles when the mother is vaccinated, so the recommendation is often to wait until 1 year of age for the most effective protection. 
Except when there’s an outbreak. 
“If the risk is increased, vaccinating children less than one year of age is recommended; it’s safe,” Shaw told Source. And with no antiviral therapies to treat measles, “the only preventive tool we have is vaccination,” she said. “Once your child is infected, our tools are pretty limited in terms of what we can do to treat, support and help your child to heal.”
New Mexico’s cases as of April 18 stood at 63, with no new cases reported on Friday, according to a Department of Health spokesperson. The bulk of those cases —59 — occurred in Lea County. Of the total cases, 46 afflicted non-vaccinated people; six were vaccinated; and 11 had unknown vaccination statuses. In nearby West Texas, where New Mexico’s outbreak likely began, the health department on Friday reported 597 confirmed since late January, an increase of 36 since the April 15 update.
Nationwide, according to the CDC’s most recent figures, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases have been reported by 25 jurisdictions. The 2019 series of outbreaks totaled 1,249 measles infections, and were the largest in the U.S. since the CDC declared measles eradicated in 2000. 
Shaw praised the strong responses from local health departments and vaccination strategies for bringing that outbreak under control, but expressed concern about misinformation’s impact on public health.
“It was through vaccination how we stopped [the 2019] outbreak,” Shaw said. “Unfortunately, we don’t have such a strong intervention in place now, and certainly doesn’t seem to be very coordinated. I’m concerned this will continue to spread.”
Public health authorities warned about the threats of vaccine safety misinformation even before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the concerns have accelerated since then, according to Jagdish Khubchandani, a public health professor at New Mexico State University. 
Khubchandani co-authored a 2021 paper on vaccine hesitancy during the pandemic and is currently funded by the National Science Foundation grant to further study misinformation impacts on public health. 
“It’s a complicated problem, and I think it needs urgent action at the local, regional and global levels,” he told Source. “We have seen, in the meanwhile, that the rise of misinformation and vaccine hesitancy proliferates at a faster rate than awareness campaigns for vaccination.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-462294288-1024x706.jpg,,,2025-04-18 16:07:21.155793

Credit: Getty ImagesIn 2018, the Florida Legislature reacted to the mass shooting in Parkland by passing major safety regulations. Chances for a such a response to Thursday’s shootings at Florida State University are slim.
That doesn’t mean legislators are ignoring the politics of guns.
Start with Miami Republican state Sen. Illeana Garcia, who joined with three Senate Democrats in a committee vote last month rejecting a proposal sponsored by then-GOP Sen. Randy Fine (SB 814) to allow concealed weapons on college and university campuses.
“I have zero regret,” Garcia said on X late Thursday night about that vote, in which she joined with Democratic Sens. Jason Pizzo, Mack Bernard, and Carlos Guillermo Smith in opposing the proposal. Two other Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee were absent for the vote.
“Proud to have voted against your moronic campus carry bill, that didn’t have a house companion,” Garcia said, referring to Fine. “This decision wasn’t about partisan politics; it was rooted in common sense. The incident at FSU was tragic, but the real issue lies not with the firearm itself, but with the factors that led to it. The individual involved was the child of a deputy sheriff and had knowledge of weapon handling, yet chose to act recklessly.”
Fine noted the vote in a posting on X on Friday, where he included an excerpt of his speech in the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 25.
“There is no magic force field that keeps guns from coming onto our college campuses,” he said. “Less than one month ago, in my last bill presentation as a Florida Senator, I attempted to give adults the same right to protect themselves on campus as they have off. My four-minute closing speech is below. For the first and only time in 8.5 years in the Legislature, I failed. By a vote of 3-4, with two absent, the committee voted to keep universities ‘gun-free zones.’ An offensive name given what happened yesterday. The no vote included all three Democrats plus one so-called Republican. I am incredibly grateful to the law enforcement who ran into the gunfire yesterday to subdue the gunman. But in the time that took, this murderer was able to shoot seven people, two of whom have died. Today, I wonder if one of those seven had been able to defend themselves, the outcome would have been different. In any event, I will continue praying for all.”
Following the Parkland school shooting in February of 2018, within weeks the Florida Legislature and then-Gov. Rick Scott came together to pass the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public High School Safety Act, a comprehensive measure that included numerous provisions regarding firearms and school safety, plus community mental health resources.
There have been attempts over the past three legislative sessions to repeal a provision of that law that bans individuals under 21 years of age from purchasing rifles and shotguns, and prohibiting licensed firearm dealers, importers, and manufacturers, from selling them to people of that age. Those measures have passed the House in 2023, 2024, and this year. In the past two years, the Senate did not pass a companion measure, and a similar measure has yet to advance in the 2025 legislative session.

The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

 DEI-related cuts

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
 Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
 Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.
Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas formally appealed on Friday the federal government’s denial of funds to aid recovery from March 14-15 storms and tornadoes.
In a letter to President Donald Trump and FEMA Regional Administrator George Robinson, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders asked the administration to reconsider its rejection of her requests for disaster declarations for individual assistance and public assistance.
“Arkansas communities are still recovering from this spring’s tornadoes, as the sheer magnitude of this event resulted in overwhelming amounts of debris, widespread destruction to homes and businesses, the tragic loss of three lives, and injuries to many others,” Sanders said. “To relieve the burden on these counties, cities, and towns, I am appealing FEMA’s decision to deny Arkansas’ Major Disaster Declaration request.”
Sanders originally sought the major disaster declaration on April 2; FEMA issued its denial on April 11.
Sanders’ letter notes that “without the support of a Major Disaster Declaration, Arkansas will face significant challenges in assuming full responsibility and achieving an effective recovery from this event. I
have determined that the severity and magnitude of these storms exceed the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to respond adequately. As such, supplemental Federal assistance is crucial.”
The state’s request includes Baxter, Stone, Sharp, Hempstead, Independence, Randolph, Nevada, Jackson, Clay, Woodruff, Greene, Hot Spring,  Izard and Lawrence counties.
Trump earlier this year called the Federal Emergency Management Agency “a disaster” and suggested it “might go away.” He said states could take care of disaster responses on their own and convened a group to review the agency and recommended changes.

The grant terminations came after President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order to “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and “environmental justice” offices and positions.” 

Of the 19 grants terminated in Connecticut, 17 were designated to Yale and two to UConn.
In 2024, the Yale School of Medicine received more than $598 million in NIH funding. The cancelled grants were originally for more than $42 million combined. Slightly more than $11 million was unspent when the awards were terminated.
At the University of Connecticut, the grants totaled $1.7 million, with $1 million left unspent when they were terminated, according to the tracker maintained by Noam Ross of rOpenSci and Scott Delaney of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
According to the NIH grants policy statement, grant payments are usually awarded as advance payments. “The intent is that recipients draw funds on an as-needed basis —specifically, no more than 3 business days before the funds are needed,” the policy states.
Most of the research cut for both schools were of research projects that dealt with mental health and LGBTQ+ issues. Words like “sex,” “transgender,” “mental health” and “minority” were among the most commonly used words in the titles of the grants.
Some of these projects supported research on AIDS prevention and HIV, alcohol use, and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
These awards support departments such as internal medicine, public health and preventive medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, emergency medicine, social sciences and engineering. 
While most grants supported research projects, there were also other activities supported by the cut grants.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OSg3M-most-of-yale-s-terminated-grants-were-for-its-medical-school-1024x649.png,,,2025-04-18 15:10:12.027806

Green International Airport. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The deadline to obtain a REAL ID is less than a month away, yet more than one-third of Rhode Islanders still haven’t made the switch to the license required for air travel.
Starting May 7, 2025, travelers 18 or older nationwide must present either their U.S. passport or the REAL ID cards marked with a gold star in the top right corner to board domestic flights or enter federal buildings. International travel will still require a passport.
President George W. Bush signed a law mandating REAL IDs in 2005 in response to the security concerns raised by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The original compliance deadline was in 2008, but has been delayed by the federal government several times. 
This time, federal officials say enforcement is really happening. About 81% of U.S. air travelers now have a REAL ID-compliant or otherwise acceptable form of identification, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

But Rhode Island still lags behind, with just under 62% of credentials issued by the state Division of Motor Vehicles meeting the federal standards. The state began offering REAL ID-compliant licenses in 2018.
On Friday, DMV spokesperson Paul Grimaldi said the state was averaging 268 daily REAL ID reservations across its six offices. The DMV will issue a temporary paper ID, but it may not be accepted at Transit Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints.
Worried about potential delays at airports, U.S. Sen Jack Reed (D-R.I.) wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Thursday asking what federal officials will do to process travelers who arrive at airport security checkpoints without REAL ID.
The TSA in January said it would conduct “phased enforcement” over two years, with the ability to issue warnings to people without Real IDs to avoid operational disruption.
“TSA will implement REAL ID effectively and efficiently, continuing to ensure the safety and security of passengers while also working to minimize operational disruptions at airports, including at Rhode Island T.F. Green airport,” agency spokesperson Daniel Velez said in an emailed statement Friday.
Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Rhode Island Current Friday that the department will “ continue to collaborate with state, local, and airport authorities to inform the public, facilitate compliance, curb wait times and prevent fraud.”
Rhode Islanders who plan to travel after May 7 are advised to schedule their DMV appointments four to six weeks before flying in order to ensure getting their REAL ID mailed in time.
REAL ID appointments are also available at local AAA branches for members. First time applicants will be required to provide one proof of identity document such as a birth certificate, proof of Social Security, and two proofs of Rhode Island residency such as a utility bill.
If your name has changed, you’ll need to provide official documentation, such as a government-issued marriage certificate, divorce decree, or adoption paperwork.
Travelers applying for a REAL ID within their renewal period, which is the 90 days before a license or ID expires, don’t have to pay any additional costs. Outside that renewal period, it will cost $27.50 to upgrade to a REAL ID.

Jared Polis speaks at the state Capitol on March 13, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis vetoed his first bill of this year’s legislative session, rejecting a bill that would have changed the state’s open records law.
“It would certainly be convenient for the Executive Branch to agree to weaken CORA, but as a representative for the people of Colorado, I support more, not less, openness and transparency,” the Democrat wrote in his Thursday veto letter, referring to the Colorado Open Records Act.
Senate Bill 25-77 was a bipartisan measure that would have extended the timeline that a records custodian has to respond to a CORA request, except for requests from journalists. It also would have given entities more time to respond to a request if they decided the request was for financial gain, like obtaining information on a large group of people in order to solicit  business.

The bill was sponsored by Sen. Cathy Kipp, a Fort Collins Democrat, Sen. Janice Rich, a Grand Junction Republican, Rep. Matt Soper, a Delta Republican, and Rep. Michael Carter, an Aurora Democrat. Kipp and Soper ran a similar bill last year that died in a Senate committee.
“I was really hoping that he would decide not to veto it,” Kipp said. “I think it is a very fair bill that we worked for a couple years on in order to get it into a good place. We have several elements of the bill that are good for both requestees and for requesters, and I think it would make things easier.”
The bill passed on a 45-19 vote in the House and a 27-6 vote in the Senate, which would satisfy the two-thirds requirement to override a veto if the Legislature pursues one. The lawmaking session ends the first week of May.
Kipp said sponsors are having conversations about pursuing a veto override.
Polis took issue with allowing public officials to make those determinations on who the requester is and what their motives are.
“The bill leaves the custodian with far too much power to define who is and is not a member of the media, and what is and isn’t news,” he wrote. “For instance, a public official may deem a request from a media outlet focusing specifically on climate change as not meeting the statutory definitions of ‘newsperson’ or ‘mass medium’ given the perspective of some elected officials that climate change is categorically not news.”
The bill relied on existing definitions of “mass medium” and “newsperson” found in state statute related to courts and court procedures.
Polis also objected to the creation of different CORA response timelines for different types of requests, ranging from three days for journalists and 30 days for businesses seeking records for financial gain.
“A newsperson, a member of the public, and a person seeking financial gain may all request the same information and, under this bill, get access to that information on different timelines,” Polis wrote. “To ensure fairness and confidence in public transparency, all legitimate requests for public transparency under CORA should be treated equally under the law, without preference for some requestors over others.”
But to Kipp, the bill’s intention is for the government to not conduct “market research” for businesses on the same timeline and cost for others seeking public records.
The bill’s bipartisan group of sponsors and supporters had argued that the bill was intended to give public officials a reasonable amount of time to respond to an increasing volume of requests.
“People should be able to get information that they want to get. So what we’re mostly doing with this bill is trying to clarify the processes for requesters, and to give those public entities and records custodians just a little bit more time to fulfill those requests, because it’s become just an overwhelming burden,” Kipp said.
The Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition’s advocacy committee had asked Polis earlier this month to veto the bill, arguing in a letter that it would create unnecessary barriers “for people seeking to gain a better understanding of state and local government activities in Colorado.”

U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) raised more than any U.S. House candidate in Pennsylvania in the first three months of 2025. From the beginning of January to the end of March, Fitzpatrick raised $1.22 million and spent just under $275,000.
Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Bucks County serving his fifth term in Congress, also holds the most cash on hand of any incumbent candidate in the commonwealth. Campaign finance records show he entered April with $5.37 million, a significant amount more than other GOP lawmaker who will likely face high-priced reelection bids.
At this point in the previous cycle, Fitzpatrick’s campaign had just $1.91 million cash on hand.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Four of the top five fundraisers in the commonwealth’s congressional delegation in Q1 are being targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) as seats to flip in 2026. Pennsylvania is the only state that the DCCC is targeting more than 3 GOP held seats in its initial list of targets for the next election.
Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House, flipped two seats in Pennsylvania during the 2024 election.
Berwood Yost, the director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll, told the Capital-Star it’s no surprise Republican incumbents are among the leaders in fundraising for Q1, since they are the most competitive seats in the state.
“They will attract the most interest, particularly to hold the Republican majority,” Yost said. “I mean, if you lose those four seats, you’ve got issues nationally.”
While Democrats are placing a high priority to be on offense in Pennsylvania, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), did not include any Democratic held seats in its initial 2026 target list.
U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District), who defeated incumbent Democrat Matt Cartwright for the seat in 2024 by roughly 1.5 points, raised the second highest in the state’s congressional delegation for Q1. The GOP freshman raised just under $835,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March, while spending $170,000. Bresnahan’s campaign entered April with $715,000 cash on hand.
Another Republican freshman member of the state’s congressional delegation finished Q1 with the third highest haul. U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District), who unseated incumbent Democrat Susan Wild in 2024 by 1 point, raised just under $675,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March and spent roughly $165,000. His campaign entered April with $615,000 on hand.
  Rep. Scott Perry talking to reporters at the Capitol Sept. 19, 2023 (Jennifer Shutt/ States Newsroom)
U.S. Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District), who is coming off of his closest race for reelection since winning a seat in the U.S. House in 2012, raised $565,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March and spent just under $95,000. Perry’s haul was the fifth highest in the state’s congressional delegation.
Perry’s campaign entered April with slightly less than $555,000, which is more than he had at this point in the previous cycle when his campaign had just over $360,000.
Yost said he imagines that there’s going to be “ample donors” for challengers in those competitive seats, since it is being targeted by the DCCC.
“It’s a little too soon to make any judgments about Democrats’ interest or enthusiasm, simply because you don’t really have candidates doing that fundraising yet,” Yost said.
“The normal ebb and flow is the incumbents are going to do what they can to solidify their donor base if they are expecting a challenge,” Yost said. “And we’ll know more about how competitive those races will be once we have declared candidates with the infrastructure that they need to report the fundraising.”
The only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation to not raise more than every Democrat is U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-16th District), who raised just over $125,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March.
Although the 2026 midterm elections are 21 months away, national ratings outlets indicate that the races Democrats are targeting in the state should be competitive. The Cook Political Report rates Mackenzie and Perry’s bid for reelections in the 7th and 10th Congressional Districts, respectively, as “toss-ups.”
They also rate Bresnahan’s bid for a second term in the 8th Congressional District as “lean Republican,” and Fitzpatrick’s quest for another term representing parts of suburban Philadelphia as “likely Republican.”
The only Democrat on the radar of that national ratings outlet is U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-17th District) – a race they describe as “likely Democratic.” Deluzio raised just under $250,000 in Q1, which is more than any other Democratic incumbent in the state’s congressional delegation.

Democrats begin lining up for competitive House races
While the primary election for the House is still one year away, a few candidates have already entered the 2026 race.
Bucks County Commissioner Bob Harvie, a Democrat, announced earlier this month that he’s seeking his party’s nomination to face Fitzpatrick. Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure, a Democrat, declared his entrance into the race against Mackenzie for the 7th Congressional District in February.
As of April 18, no Democratic candidates have filed to run for the 8th and 10th Congressional Districts to challenge Bresnahan and Perry, although rematches for both races could happen. Cartwright told the Scranton Times-Tribune in January that he might run for the 8th Congressional District again in 2026, while Janelle Stelson, the Democrat who lost to Perry by 1.2 points last year, said last month that she is “seriously considering” a second run for the 10th Congressional District.
Yost said it’s too soon to tell how these races are going to shape up, but said he thinks “we can probably suggest” that the Democratic candidates “will be pretty well funded in all of these races,” as well as the Republican candidates, unless a weak candidate makes it through the primary election.
Due to the potential implications of the majority of the U.S. House being on the line, Yost thinks Democratic donors from across the country could weigh in on these battleground races. 
Evans’ future?
U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District) is the only member of the state’s congressional delegation to raise less than $100,000. The Philadelphia Democrat raised just under $40,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March. His campaign spent about $50,000 in Q1, which is more than it brought in during that time period.
Evans is also the only member to have less than $100,000 in his account. Entering April, his campaign had just under $65,000 on hand. The next lowest is U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District), a potential candidate for governor, who has $206,000 on hand.
  U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District)
Evans suffered a stroke in May 2024 and was reelected to another term in November. Following his illness, he did not vote for several months as he recovered. Multiple Democrats, according to a Philadelphia Inquirer report in December, would be interested in running for the seat, should Evans not seek reelection in 2026.
The names the Inquirer mentioned as potential candidates included state Sen. Sharif Street, Pennsylvania’s Democratic Party chair, state Rep. Morgan Cephas, the Philadelphia Delegation chair in the Pennsylvania House, and state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia). Dave Oxman, a physician, has already filed to run for Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District.
Rabb set up an exploratory committee in October 2023, but decided against joining the race.
The link to donate to Rabb’s exploratory committee is still active on ActBlue, although he told the Capital-Star that he set it up for the 2024 election cycle “based on persistent rumors that Rep. Evans might not run for reelection. When his name appeared on the ballot, I had no desire to run against him.”
When asked by the Capital-Star if he was actively considering a run for the seat in 2026, he said it was “too soon to say.”
A spokesperson for the Evans campaign told the Capital-Star on Friday that he “has every intention to run for re-election at this time” and “is working hard at fundraising and plans for a successful Q2.”
Evans, after a long tenure in the Pennsylvania General Assembly, defeated indicted incumbent Congressman Chaka Fattah in the Democratic Party primary in 2016 to win a seat in the U.S. House. He’s coasted to reelection since winning a seat in Congress and according to national ratings outlets, represents a safe Democratic district.
Yost said since it’s not a competitive district, “the impetus for him to raise money is not the same as it is for, say, Fitzpatrick or these other candidates that are in competitive districts.”
“That’s just the reality,” Yost said.
Fetterman posts lowest quarter since entering Senate
U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), raised an impressive $73.9 million during his successful 2022 campaign over Republican Mehmet Oz.
Although he’s not up for reelection until 2028, his campaign raised the lowest amount in a full quarter since he declared for the seat in February 2021.
Fetterman’s campaign raised just over $395,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March and spent a little more than $415,000. 
In 2024, Fetterman raised $1 million in two-consecutive quarters to end the year. His lowest haul last year was $881,000 in the first three months of 2024.
Prior to this past quarter, Fetterman’s lowest total for a three-month stretch was $720,000 from the beginning of April to the end of June in 2023.

Over the past few months, Fetterman has faced pushback from Democrats and other progressives over a number of his statements, votes, and positions, including backing multiple cabinet selections in President Donald Trump’s administration. But, he holds a positive approval rating, according to data from early this year.
Yost said there’s no doubt that there are a number of Democrats who supported Fetterman in 2022 that have “soured” on him due, in part, to some of those recent votes.
Since Fetterman isn’t up for reelection until 2028, Yost believes “he’s got plenty of time to raise money, but you can’t ignore” the pushback he’s receiving from some in his own party.
“Maybe this is an early sign that he could have trouble raising money from traditional Democratic sources,” Yost said. “It’s worth following that to see if it’s just a blip, or if this is an early indicator that he may have trouble raising money like he did in 2022.”

Efforts to contain the wildfire remain ongoing.
The Rio Grande Fire was detected around 4 p.m. on Thursday west of Bosque Farms. High winds and dry conditions pushed the fire east across the Rio Grande into the village Bosque Farms, state Forestry spokesperson George Ducker said. 
The fire, which started on Bureau of Indian Affairs jurisdiction is currently 10% contained, Ducker said. 
The fire spans roughly 60 acres, or less than a tenth of a square mile, and the structures burned may have been homes, Ducker said, , but a damage assessment is being conducted today. 
Fuels for the fire include grass, brush and other plants along the bosque. High winds and prolonged drought made fire risk high in the area and across the state Thursday. The fire also caused evacuations but those have since been lifted, Ducker said. 
The cause of the fire is still under investigation, Ducker said, though some online wildfire databases say it was “human caused.”
Crews worked through the night to contain the fire and have since established divisions on the north and south sides of it to try to contain it further. Crews will look to increase containment and extinguish hotspots within the bosque today, Ducker said. 
Winds in the area are expected to decrease, and scattered rain showers are expected tonight. Still, the eastern two-thirds of the state, including Bosque Farms, are under a Red Flag Warning, according to the National Weather Service.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rio-Grande-Fire_Candice-Kutrosky-e1745000802891.jpg,,,2025-04-18 15:10:12.027806

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry, a conservative Republican, drew praise from liberal Democrats after he railed against large corporations and called for stricter regulations on the insurance industry — an uncommon spectacle that suggested the governor is staking his political fate on lowering policy rates.
Testifying in a nearly two-hour exchange Wednesday with lawmakers on the House Insurance Committee, Landry urged his fellow Republicans to break from their traditional alignment with insurance companies and vote in favor of House Bill 576, a Democrat-backed proposal that’s part of an agenda Landry has described as a “balanced approach” to the decades-old rate debate between personal injury lawyers and the insurance companies they sue. 
Louisiana pollster John Couvillon said Landry can’t really afford not to take on the insurance issue because policy premiums are by far the most overwhelming concern of voters and likely outweighs any risk associated with bipartisanship.
“If he can bend the cost curve on insurance rates, that’s something he can take credit for,” Couvillon said. “Who he works with to do it is much more insider baseball. I don’t know if that kind of perception would matter with the average Louisiana voter who’s really more concerned with high insurance rates.”  
Landry has included multiple bills on his agenda that target both insurance companies and trial lawyers, but House Bill 576 could be part of a larger political calculation that affords him more opportunities for reward than risk. 
Cosponsored by moderate Democrats Robby Carter of Amite and Chad Brown of Plaquemine, the bill would give the state insurance commissioner the power to prohibit any insurance rates considered “excessive” during any market conditions. Currently, the commissioner can only exercise that power after holding a public hearing in which someone proves that the insurance market lacks competition. 
The bill applies to all lines of insurance, though Landry has focused his attention mostly on auto and property insurance rates. Spikes in homeowner premiums occurred after a series of destructive storms starting in 2020 and have been mostly limited to the coastal regions. Premiums for auto insurance have long been elevated across Louisiana, and lawmakers have struggled to identify a clear reason why, believing the problem is rooted in policy decisions. 
Landry and Brown sat shoulder-to-shoulder Wednesday as they presented the measure, which includes an amendment the governor said he wrote himself and modeled after a law in Mississippi. Louisiana’s neighbor has average auto insurance rates that are nearly half the amount of Louisiana’s, according to U.S. News & World Report.
Brown’s bill cleared the committee in a 13-4 vote but still has a ways to go before final passage, and Landry’s office would not say if the governor will continue to shepherd the bill over each subsequent hurdle.  
“It certainly helped that the governor was there to support it,” Brown said in an interview, adding that he hopes Landry will testify at subsequent hearings. He thinks the governor has sent a clear enough message to Republican lawmakers about what they need to vote for.
Landry paired his appearance with rhetoric that potentially puts him at odds with his own party, which has traditionally favored pro-capitalist narratives.
Louisiana lawmakers dissect personal injury laws as attorney-legislators protest

“We’re losing sight of something that’s been going on in this country for quite some time, and that is consolidation … That is exactly why we need this law,” Landry said, “because we have allowed corporations to control large market shares in violation of Sherman [Antitrust Act] again and again.”
Congress passed the Sherman Act in 1890 to establish rules for competitive trade and prevent unfair monopolies. 
Rep. Edmond Jordan of Baton Rouge and New Orleans Reps. Matt Willard and Mandie Landry, all Democrats, thanked the governor for putting effort into the issue and trying to hold insurance companies accountable. They joined Landry in arguing tort reform legislation, which is based on the idea that trial lawyers have an unfair advantage in court, has not worked.
One of the four Republicans who voted against the Brown bill, Rep. Jay Gallé of Mandeville, told his colleagues it would undermine “all free market principles” of supply and demand and ultimately discourage new insurance companies from coming to Louisiana. He argued it would give the insurance commissioner sole authority to arbitrarily decide rates. 
Brown clarified the commissioner would only be able to approve or reject rates, not set them. The governor argued Louisiana could never have a “free market” for insurance because the law requires drivers and homeowners to have coverage.  
“The free market rules do not apply when the consumer is mandated to buy something,” Gov. Landry said.
In a later interview, Gallé said he was in an uncomfortable situation having to choose between supporting his party leader versus following his conscience and beliefs. 
“When it is a quote-unquote ‘governor’s bill,’ the pressure is already on you, and when he takes the time to come and sit in the room that adds a little more pressure,” Gallé said. “I hated to go against the governor, but at the end of the day I had to go with what’s best for my district.”
Whether the Brown bill would even have an impact on insurance rates is questionable. Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple, who is opposed to it — and in a public feud with the governor — has said actuaries in his office have reviewed high policy rates in Louisiana and found them to be justified based on losses insurers have accrued in defending lawsuits. 
The governor’s bill would back the commissioner into a corner, forcing him to choose between rates based on market data or rates artificially suppressed for political reasons, Temple said. 
The governor has cast suspicion on Temple’s opposition to the bill, repeating an argument Rep. Mandie Landry made earlier in the hearing when she asked the governor if he ever knew of a politician who shied away from having greater control. 
“I’ve never seen a politician not want more power,” the governor said.
At the same time, some claim the governor is focused on Brown’s proposal because he hopes giving more power to Temple would allow him to blame the commissioner if rates fail to improve. Temple’s office pointed to Gov. Landry’s April 9 discussion with conservative radio host Moon Griffon in which the governor suggested as much.
“If we … implement that here, giving our insurance commissioner those tools, and if the rates don’t go down, it’s on him,” the governor told Griffon. 
But according to Couvillon, deflecting blame away from the governor would be a more difficult task than most people realize. Voters are much more familiar with the governor than the insurance commissioner, so it would take a very effective messaging strategy to deflect any blame. 
“Voters tend to hold the governor accountable for things like high insurance rates whether it is a deserved measurement or not,” Couvillon said.
If Gov. Landry’s agenda has little effect and coverage premiums remain about the same, there’s enough time to try to recast his political fate and convince voters to overlook it before his re-election bid in 2027. The greatest risk in the governor’s calculation lies in the possibility that insurance rates continue to increase, which would be a much bigger problem for Gov. Landry, Couvillon said.
On the other hand, the insurance commissioner has said repeatedly previous reforms have started having an impact on homeowner coverage lines. On Wednesday, Temple told the committee eight insurers have filed rate decreases for 2025. 
“It is working,” Temple said. “Rates are coming down.”
House Bill 576 will next move to the House floor for consideration.

SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois chapter of AARP played a role in the Trump administration reversing itself and allowing Social Security beneficiaries to have the option of filing for benefits over the phone.

The continuation of phone-based filing is an about-face of a plan set forth in mid-March by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to restrict telephone services for beneficiaries nationwide. Nearly 100,000 Illinoisans mobilized against the plan by writing to Congress during the month of March. Nationally, AARP members sent more than 2 million emails denouncing the proposed changes.

In response to the widespread pushback, the SSA issued a series of updates on X, formerly Twitter, withdrawing its previously announced plan and reinstating phone services for all claim types—including those applying for retirement, Social Security disability insurance (SSDI), Medicare and supplemental security income (SSI).

The new plan now requires in-person claims processing and identity proofing only for calls flagged as potentially fraudulent, according to a press release Monday from Illinois AARP. “This is great news for older Americans,” said Ryan Gruenenfelder, senior director of advocacy and outreach at AARP Illinois.

New rule caused web crashes, service disruptions

AARP Illinois and its members came to the Illinois state Capitol on April 10 to express their frustration with the recent federal actions and call on lawmakers to strengthen SSA customer service. Members have reported significant disruptions in service in recent months, including long wait times at SSA field offices, frequent website crashes and an increase in calls getting disconnected due to a lack of available representatives.

“As a retiree, I count on my Social Security benefits, and they actually provide more than half of my monthly income,” said Sandra McAvoy, an AARP member and volunteer with the Illinois state legislature. “That income has enabled me to live independently and very comfortably.”

In Illinois, about 2.3 million people receive some form of Social Security benefits. More than 40% of Illinois residents age 65 or older rely on Social Security for at least half of their income, while around 20% rely on it for at least 90% of their income, according to AARP.

The SSA was planning to end phone-based claims as an anti-fraud measure, saying the move would strengthen fraud prevention by forcing individuals to go online or visit local field offices to prove their identities and file for benefits.

AARP said this would have made it difficult for older adults, people with disabilities and those in rural areas to access their benefits.

“The proposed changes were unacceptable,” said Gruenenfelder.

About 140,000 people age 65 and older in Illinois live more than 45 miles roundtrip from the nearest Social Security office, according to an April 8 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Once there, individuals report having to wait for hours in long lines to see an available customer service agent.

The only alternative to in-person and phone services — the SSA’s online portal system — is not a reliable option for many beneficiaries. Roughly 28% of households in Illinois do not have subscriptions to high-speed internet, according to a 2024 report from the Benton Institute for Broadband and Society.

Some callers to SSA waited hours to get help

These challenges were in place long before the now-rescinded changes. But AARP said there has since been a recent “rapid deterioration” in customer service that has resulted in callers waiting hours at a time to get connected with an available representative.

According to SSA data, the agency had a busy rate of 0% in 2024, meaning no callers received a pre-recorded message when trying to reach a service agent over the phone. But in March, that number spiked to 28.4%, indicating nearly 1 in 3 callers received a message saying the office’s lines were too busy to take their call.

The sudden disruption to customer service came after the agency’s announcement in February of a 12% target reduction of the SSA workforce and permanent closure of six of 10 regional offices by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These workforce reductions were announced despite promises by President Donald Trump not to cut or disrupt Social Security payments with his policies.

In his first speech since leaving the White House on Tuesday, April 15, former President Joe Biden spoke out against the Trump administration’s latest actions on Social Security, including sweeping workforce cuts, permanent closures of regional offices and the current customer service crisis.

“In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage,” the former president said in Chicago, according to the AP. “They’ve taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration.”

AARP celebrates the SSA’s decision to walk back its proposed changes to phone-based services, but Gruenenfelder said more oversight and resources are needed to improve the agency’s customer service moving forward.

“We’re urging Congress consistently, and the White House consistently, no matter who’s in the White House, to take actions to prioritize Social Security and protect it for the long term,” Gruenenfelder said.

Symptoms typically appear 7 to 14 days after exposure and can include a high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, white spots inside the mouth, and a distinctive rash, writes guest columnist Noreen Womack. (Getty Images)Montana health officials have announced five confirmed cases of measles in Gallatin County.

The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services along with the Gallatin City-County Health Department in Bozeman confirmed it’s the first instance of the highly infectious disease since 1990.
The individuals are children and adults who were exposed to measles while traveling outside of Montana. The cases reside in Gallatin County and are currently isolated at home. All five individuals are unvaccinated, or vaccine status is unknown.
The Gallatin City-County Health Department continues to assess any potential exposures while the individuals were contagious and are contacting the people who may have been exposed, commonly referred to as “contact tracing.” People potentially exposed are being provided with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for.
The Gallatin health department has determined that there are points of exposure to the general public. Potential exposures to the public can be found on the GCCHD website and will be updated as needed or as more information becomes available. The spread of measles can occur before people know they have the disease, and before any rash appears. The times listed on the website include the period when the exposure occurred and two hours after.
 People without prior measles infection, vaccination have 90% likelihood of contracting disease if exposed

Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.
“While it is unfortunate to have cases of measles after 35 years of disease inactivity in Montana, we have been working diligently with our local partners to prepare,” said DPHHS Public Health Physician Dr. Maggie Cook-Shimanek. “We are confident that our public health and clinical partners will work together and address this situation as quickly as possible. It is important for everyone to know their vaccination status and to visit with their health department or health care provider if they are unsure.”

If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:

Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
Check your home state immunization registries.

Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
“Measles is highly contagious and highly preventable with vaccination, and ensuring people are immunized remains our best defense. If people are unable to find their vaccine records, there are no contraindications to receiving an additional dose,” said Dr. Peter Bulger, Gallatin City-County Health Department medical director.
Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.
The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.
If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, call your primary care physician as soon as possible.
“We are actively working with individuals who are experiencing symptoms,” said Lori Christenson, Gallatin City-County Health Officer. “We greatly appreciate the cooperation of those involved in helping mitigate further exposures. We encourage anyone who is not vaccinated or unsure of their vaccination history to consider vaccination and to contact your health care provider or GCCHD. By getting vaccinated we protect ourselves and others around us from infection.”
There is no cure for measles once the outbreak has started. It’s a virus, and medical professionals treat the symptoms related to the infection.
For more information about measles and the measles vaccine, visit the state health department’s website. Additional information can also be found on the CDC’s website.

Last week, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer requested an emergency declaration from President Donald Trump for the state, 12 counties and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians following the historic ice storm that hit northern Michigan.
If granted, up to $5 million from the federal government would be made available to help northern Michigan clean up and recover.
Local, tribal and state entities and utilities have been responding to the storm for weeks, clearing roads, cleaning up debris and repairing power lines. Whitmer also called in the National Guard to help. The state estimates that costs for responding to the storm already exceed $7 million.
Officials have said federal assistance is central to recovery in the region. U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman, a Republican, and Sens. Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin, both Democrats, supported that request.
In a news release from the governor’s office, Col. James F. Grady II, director of the Michigan State Police, said approval of the emergency request “would bring critical federal resources to support local response operations that are still ongoing. This is a necessary step while we work toward the broader disaster declaration that will bring additional relief.”
But how does the process actually work?
 Disaster relief starts locally

After a disaster hits, local, tribal and state governments will typically be the first to respond. If they don’t have enough resources to deal with the aftermath, governors and tribal governments can request assistance from the federal government, which the president has to sign off on.
Disaster declarations are structured through a law called the Stafford Act.
“There are incidents that obviously the state needs help dealing with, because no state or community can take care of it on their own, and that’s when federal aid is designed to kick in,” said Anna Weber, a senior policy analyst for climate adaptation at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.
Weber spent a decade working on federal contracts related to water infrastructure and environmental health.
There are two types of federal disaster declarations. One is an emergency declaration, which the president decides on and which doesn’t have to meet any threshold.
The other is a major disaster declaration, which often requires a damage assessment to determine if an area is eligible. (In situations where it’s clear that federal assistance will be required, officials don’t have to wait for a damage assessment to request federal assistance.)
The state of Michigan will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, and the Small Business Administration to assess whether the region is eligible for that assistance.
 Whitmer requested emergency assistance from the president. What’s next?

It’s up to President Trump to decide whether or not to grant that relief, which usually goes to local entities to help with cleanup and recovery.
In an emailed statement to IPR, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, “The Trump administration is closely tracking the situation and is working with state and local officials to assess what next steps are needed.”
Emergency declarations are typically processed pretty quickly because they don’t need to meet any specific criteria. The goal is to get aid to the area quickly.
And that can also be a stopgap to give FEMA time to assess the damage to see if more assistance is needed.
If that is the case, the governor can request a major disaster declaration which would unlock additional federal dollars.
And unlike the initial emergency declaration, in a major disaster declaration FEMA considers a range of criteria, such as a state’s financial capacity and resources.
Those assessments begin next week.
“There’ll actually be people out there driving around to areas that they can reach, you know, going looking at things with clipboards, writing down the kinds of damages that we’ve seen in these areas, how much money it costs and how many additional resources the state might need in order to address it,” Weber said.
If the region is eligible for major disaster relief, other forms of aid can then come into play — such as cash payments to individuals and public assistance for more long term recovery like repairing infrastructure.
Rep. Bergman is urging counties to assist in those assessments.
“For us to have a chance at securing Individual Assistance and Public Assistance, we need to take an all-hands-on-deck approach,” he wrote in a newsletter from his office on Thursday. “I encourage our leaders in all 12 counties to support this effort as we work together to secure help for our communities.”
These relief efforts kick in after events like the ice storm, but federal hazard mitigation grants have also aimed to reduce the impact of future disasters.
 An uncertain future for FEMA

Uncertainty surrounds FEMA amid the Trump administration’s efforts to cut costs and reshape the federal government. Trump and those in his administration have said they want to drastically reduce – or even eliminate — the agency.
The situation has been constantly changing, but Weber said there have been concrete impacts: “What we have seen is that staff and programs at FEMA are being eliminated, and aid is being slower to arrive even if it’s already been approved.”
Those cuts have reached efforts to prepare for disasters as well. For example, Grist reported earlier this month that FEMA plans to dismantle a program, passed under the first Trump administration, to help communities prepare for disasters before they hit.
FEMA didn’t respond directly to IPR’s questions this week about criteria for a major disaster declaration in northern Michigan or what the damage assessment consists of.
Still, Weber said the big takeaway is that federal aid is meant to supplement what’s already being done, so people can look to local governments and organizations for information and help.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Broken-pole-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 14:10:27.278002

Here he's speaking during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Sept. 28, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Patrick Semansky-Pool/Getty Images)On April 18, 1775, Paul Revere famously rode through the streets of Massachusetts to warn residents about the approach of British troops, which culminated in the Battle of Lexington and Concord that kicked off America’s war for independence.
Now, 250 years later, U.S. Sen. Angus King is giving his own warning over what he sees as the imminent collapse of American democracy under President Donald Trump.
In an interview with writer, historian and Lincoln County resident Heather Cox Richardson, Maine’s independent senator discussed why this inflection point in American history is so resonant today.
“I believe we are in one of the most dangerous places our country has been in since the founding, because what is happening before our eyes is the collapse of the constitutional structure that the framers designed to protect us from the inevitable abuse that comes from the concentration of power,” King said, explaining that the U.S. Constitution purposefully divided power between the Legislature — or Congress — the President and the courts.
“But here’s what’s happening right now,” he said, “is that the executive branch is seizing more and more power.
“There are two levels of things going on here: one is bad and the other is dangerous,” he said. “There are bad things like what [the Department of Government Efficiency] is doing and messing around with Social Security and this sending people to El Salvador. That’s really bad, but what’s dangerous is the way it’s being done, by essentially violating the plain intent of the Constitution, by having the President be the legislator and the executive at the same time, that’s a recipe for the loss of our freedom.”
And for people who are “cheering on his agenda” and saying, “Well, we don’t care that he’s doing all this unconstitutional stuff,” King said, “They’re going to care because eventually the Eye of Sauron is going to turn on them,” referencing the evil, all-powerful symbol in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings.”
And while the courts are “doing pretty well so far” in pushing back, King repeatedly expressed alarm over what he sees as Congress’ abdication of its duty and the complicity of his Republican colleagues.
“What we have is a test between institutional loyalty, constitutional loyalty, and party loyalty. And so my Republican colleagues — who I’m doing everything I can to sort of peel off to say, ‘Enough is enough’ — so far, haven’t been willing to take that step,” he said. “They’re in control of the Senate, they’re in control of the House, and they’re looking at getting their tax bill through and getting their budget bill through, rather than what’s happening to the structure of our government in the process.”
He also said that he believes many Republicans are not speaking up because of Trump’s threat to challenge dissenters in upcoming elections by running primary opponents financed by billionaire advisor Elon Musk.
King also spoke about the frustration among voters, acknowledging the most frequent question he hears is, “I’m mad as hell. What can I do?’”
“They can get together, they can talk to each other, they can reach out to their neighbors,” King said. “They can participate in peaceful demonstrations that indicate to people like me that people want change, that they’re concerned…They also can communicate to our offices.”
He said American people actually have a lot of power and that members of Congress are influenced when they hear stories from constituents about how Trump’s actions are having a real negative impact on their lives — such as someone whose Social Security check didn’t come or a veteran unable to get a medical appointment.
“Believe it or not, anecdotes matter,” King said, “and so when people are in touch with us, if they are specific about what’s going on and what’s affecting them in their real life, that’s the kind of thing that breaks through with members of Congress — that their constituents are being hurt — and that’s one of the reasons I think we may see some progress on this over the next two or three weeks, because the damage that’s being done is just starting to manifest itself out in the communities.”
But King acknowledged he is “an optimist.”
As for Paul Revere, Maine is celebrating his midnight ride with a series of events that will feature the lighting of lanterns and lighthouses throughout the state. Organized by the Maine Semiquincentennial Commission, several of the ceremonies will include the reading of the famous 1861 poem by Portland native Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, “Paul Revere’s Ride,” which concludes:


So through the night rode Paul Revere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm,—
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts (Joe Raedle/Getty Images).For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Matthew Perschall / Louisiana Illuminator)It had been many years since Phyllis Taylor, widow to the creator of the TOPS program, had sat behind the presentation desk of the Louisiana House Education Committee. 
Her late husband, Patrick F. Taylor, a wealthy oilman who had served for many years on the LSU Board of Supervisors, is perhaps best remembered for creating the program that’s now known as the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students. The program began with 183 students that Taylor personally paid tuition for. After this pilot’s success, Taylor convinced the legislature to begin a state-financed version, which inspired similar programs in numerous other states. 
Started in 1989, it pays a significant chunk of tuition costs for qualified Louisiana students who attend college at state colleges and universities. Hundreds of thousands of students have paid for college with TOPS, many who would have otherwise been unable to afford an education. 
Every year, lawmakers debate tweaks to TOPS, some minor, some major. But Phyllis Taylor, a soft-spoken octogenarian philanthropist and one of the richest people in Louisiana, has refrained from weighing in — until this week. 
What piqued Taylor’s interest was House Bill 77 by Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston. It would create a flat rate for each TOPS award amount, rather than having a unique allotment for each school. 
The new rate would mean students at LSU, LSU’s two medical schools and the University of New Orleans would be paying more out of pocket, while students at other Louisiana schools would pay less. 
The bill would also create a higher award amount for high-achieving students. 
In its original state, Turner’s bill – designed to keep high-performing students in Louisiana – would add around $50 million annually to the cost of the TOPS program. That’s not a small sum as the state tightens its belt amid difficult fiscal times. 
“I come to remind everyone that we want, by all means, to preserve TOPS, even if that means that some changes might have to be deferred for a later time, because I realized that the state of Louisiana is going to be under dire fiscal constraints,” Taylor said. 
“There is more need than there is money,” she added. 
Taylor made her position on Turner’s bill clear; she’s unhappy with the proposal that would hurt LSU students, who make up the majority of TOPS recipients in the state. She reminded the committee that while they may want to reward the best and brightest, TOPS was meant to provide an opportunity for all students – not just those with the best ACT scores. 
“Let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water and jeopardize a program as a whole in order to maybe provide for a few that might not be as contributing to our state as we need,” Taylor said. 
The committee unanimously advanced Turner’s legislation, though only after adding amendments that would partially close the gap for students at LSU’s main campus and undergraduate programs at its medical school in New Orleans. Members also lowered the new award amount for high-achieving students from $12,000 to $11,300. 
House Education Chairwoman Laurie Schlegel, R-Metairie, one of the co-authors on Turner’s bill, said she believed the amendments would lower the TOPS cost increase from around $50 million annually to $30 million to $35 million. 
Because it involves spending state money,  the bill must receive a second hearing in the House Appropriations Committee, which oversees the state’s budget. 
Though Appropriations Chairman Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, acknowledged the need to keep the best and brightest in Louisiana, he said it would be very challenging to find the money to fund Turner’s bill, especially as lawmakers are digging into couch cushions to find the change necessary to prevent a K-12 teacher pay cut. 
“Before we go and we commit ourselves to more, I think we need to address what we currently have in front of us,” McFarland said.

‘It wasn’t fair’ 
Turner said his bill is meant to address what he sees as inequities among Louisiana colleges in the amount of TOPS assistance available to their students.
“It wasn’t fair to give this university more and not the other one,” Turner said in an interview.  “All the institutions would be treated equally.” 
The bill is being sold as a market solution: the money follows the student, who can make a financial decision about how they would like to use it. But its critics say that choice could potentially disfavor the LSU flagship campus. 
Currently, LSU students who receive TOPS pay about $5,000 out of pocket annually, while students at Louisiana Tech University, in Turner’s district, pay $5,202. 
If Turner’s bill passes, the base-level amount, which approximately half of Louisiana TOPS students receive, would be $6,000 annually. 
TOPS Performance students, who must have at least a 3.25 GPA and a 23 ACT score, would receive $6,500. TOPS Honors students, with at least a 3.5 GPA and a 27 ACT score, would receive $9,000. The bill’s proposed TOPS Excellence award, the new highest amount, would be $11,300 per qualifying student, who must earn at least a 31 on the ACT and a 3.5 GPA. 
LSU and LSU Health New Orleans students would receive an additional $700 per year on top of whatever award level they earn. 
That would mean baseline TOPS students would pay out of pocket approximately $5,770 to attend LSU and $4,755 to attend Louisiana Tech. 

For some schools with lower tuition and fees, the new award amounts would provide some students with an excess. Under present law, that money has to be applied to students’ room and board expenses, which typically are paid out of pocket. But under a law the legislature approved last year, schools have complete autonomy to raise their fees, meaning they could increase the cost of attendance to meet the new award amount — and add to their revenues. 
Increasing the out-of-pocket costs for LSU students came as a bit of a surprise after the House Education Committee held a series of hearings over the past year in which they repeatedly questioned university administrators about why so many Louisiana students were leaving the state — and why LSU was admitting so many out-of-state students. 
Lawmakers have raised this concern so frequently over the past year that LSU launched new software, LSU Insight, designed to answer questions lawmakers frequently put to the university about where LSU students live and work. They unveiled the new program at a Senate budget hearing earlier this month and with an email to each lawmaker. 
Legislators frequently raised the issue that students in their community were being offered more money to attend Alabama or Ole Miss. They then asked why LSU couldn’t offer more to keep them home — and why LSU offered thousands of dollars in tuition assistance to out of state students at the same time. 
LSU President William Tate said the university profits only about $500 over four years from an in-state student. But even with a generous financial aid package, the margin for each out-of-state student is so high that it subsidizes the tuition assistants for two Louisiana enrollees. 
Increasing out-of-pocket costs for Louisianians at LSU could lead more students to accept generous financial aid packages at its competitors, or to go to schools like Louisiana Tech or the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Any loss of in-state students would ultimately lead LSU to seek more out of state students, compounding the problem lawmakers have raised to them for months.

Feb. 25, 2025. Photo: Jim NeugerOngoing conflict over the state’s protections for transgender people is threatening to thwart the decades-long effort to pass an Equal Rights Amendment, which had been a major focus of late South Portland Rep. Lois Reckitt.
Though LD 260 passed the House with a majority of support, it will require two-thirds of lawmakers to back the measure for it to appear on the ballot.
And at long last, lawmakers came to a resolution as to whether the song “Welcome Home” would become the official state anthem (LD 373) after the House backed down from its support of the tune.
Other votes of note:
Following a positive vote in the Senate last week, members of the House voted 77-72 to pass LD 585, which will amend language in the Efficiency Maine Trust Act so that funds currently dedicated to subsidizing heat pumps could also be used for the state’s depleted electric vehicle incentive program.
Both chambers supported the committee recommendation against legislation that would modify the pending ban on products containing PFAS to exempt certain cookware, such as nonstick pans. During the Senate debate, Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), who opposed the bill, noted that initially the product ban, set to take effect January 2026, included all products with intentionally added PFAS but industry reps have repeatedly “sought to undo that good work.” LD 827 was rejected in the Senate 22-12 and the House 120-22.
Legislation (LD 1185) that raises the age for someone to be able to get married from 17 to 18 passed the House 93-52 and the Senate 23-11, but not without extensive debate in the House. Some critics of the measure pointed to the ability for young people to have abortions or access gender affirming care. However, Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth) pointed out that Maine is the only New England state that hasn’t raised the age to 18 and referenced data from the Bureau of Vital Statistics which showed about half a dozen minors a year are married, almost entirely minor girls marrying older adults. That disparity raises concerns, Kuhn said, adding she wouldn’t want Maine to become an attractive place for people seeking to marry minors. 
Following the House vote last week, the Senate on Tuesday rejected a bill (19-15 vote against) that would have prohibited any state agency from providing informational or educational materials about the COVID-19 vaccine for children under 18. Health committee chair Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York) said while the intent of the bill may be to limit the influence of government in health decisions, he warned that if passed the impacts would be far reaching. Read more about the bill here. 
A resolve directing the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women to study the extent of workforce gender segregation in the state passed the House 82-63 and Senate 22-12. Labor committee co-chair Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor), who supported the bill, said the legislation addresses the persistent issue of “occupational segregation,” which hampers true gender equity. However, critic Rep. Joseph Underwood (R-Presque Isle) said the bill represents the perfect definition of “identity politics.”

The House and Senate both voted to back the committee’s recommendation against a bill that would repeal a measure authorizing the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to potentially grant a permit for the development of an offshore wind port on Sears Island. The bill, LD 735, would also impose limits on who could propose similar legislation in the future. 
Both chambers also voted to accept the committee recommendation against LD 969, which would direct the Emergency Medical Services’ Board to adopt rules to allow municipalities to conduct or host emergency medical services licensing training. Bill sponsor Rep. Cheryl Golek (D-Harpswell) said that 15 of Maine’s counties are “ambulance deserts” and argued the bill would allow for much-needed training opportunities for volunteer medics but members of the committee said this bill is not the vehicle to solve that problem.
These bills also passed: LD 94, “An Act to Eliminate Miscarriage Reporting Requirements;” LD 415, “An Act to Support Hunger Prevention in Maine;” LD 815, “An Act to Provide Funding for Respite Care and Supplemental Services Provided by the Family Caregiver Support Program;” LD 905 “An Act to Clarify the Process to Transfer Funds Resulting from the Expiration of Unused Kilowatt-hour Credits to Be Used to Provide Assistance to Low-income Electricity Customers;” LD 1195, “An Act to Amend the Provisions of the Maine Workers’ Compensation Act of 1992 Governing Requirements for Self-insurers;” LD 678, “An Act to Provide for the 2025 and 2026 Allocations;” and LD 1240, “An Act to Align the Schedules for Climate Change Protection Plans and Grid-enhancing Technology Reviews with the Integrated Grid Planning Process,” among others.
Senate votes
Members of the Senate voted Tuesday to confirm Gigi Guyton Thompson of Peaks Island, Deborah Neuman of Hampden, and Daniel Piltch of Freeport to the Maine Retirement Savings Board.
The Senate on Thursday voted 21-13 to pass LD 143, which would provide an annual allocation of $6.18 million for family planning services, which include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. Such funding is not used for abortions. 
Providers have said this funding is particularly crucial given years of stagnant state funding in addition to the Trump administration’s recent freeze on Title X, the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services. 
House votes
Members of the House on Thursday voted 74-69 in support of a proposed constitutional amendment to establish that all Maine residents have equal rights under the law. Legislators for decades have pressed for an Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution but have so far fallen short. In order to be placed on the ballot for voters to decide on, LD 260 will ultimately need to secure two-thirds support of both chambers in reenactment votes. 
Sponsor Rep. Holly Sergent (D-York) said the U.S. Constitution “began with a narrow vision of to whom equal rights were given. But our national and state constitutions are living, evolving and expanding pronouncements of what Americans believe. Throughout our history, our constitutions have gradually redefined who is worthy of all of the rights to be bestowed and who can be excluded, who is viewed as less than human.” LD 260, she said, “sets Maine as a beacon that it proudly affirms the protections of the Maine Human Rights Act and embeds them in our constitution.”
But critics described the bill as a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” that would “hurt biological women” (Rep. Katrina Smith of Palmero and Rep. John Eder of Waterboro, respectively).
Legislators voted this week to pass LD 875, which provides $4 million dollars this year and next to fund essential services for victims of domestic violence. As an emergency measure, it needs to be enacted by two-thirds of lawmakers in order to be made available immediately. The House voted 140-0 and it now advances to the Senate.
Republican Alicia Collins of Sidney was the only representative to vote against LD 468, which would provide an additional $1.2 million per year to the Fund to Address Food Insecurity and Provide Nutritional Incentives, which supports programs that allow low-income Mainers to use their benefits to buy produce from farmers. More on that here.
Members of the House voted 75-68 to back the committee’s recommendation against LD 717, “An Act to Amend the Maine Criminal Code Governing Restitution to Include the Costs of All Analyses of Suspected Illegal Drugs.”

Authorities responded “almost immediately,” and “engaged, neutralized, and apprehended” the shooter, Tallahassee Police Department Chief Lawrence Revell said during a press conference Thursday afternoon, joined by officials from the FBI, FSU Police, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and university administrators.
Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare said two patients from the shooting are expected to be discharged Friday, while three are in good condition and another remains in fair condition.

Alex Andrade, a Republican representing parts of Escambia and Santa Rosa counties, speaks to reporters on April 9, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)There have been additional resignations at the embattled Hope Florida Foundation, the nonprofit affiliated with Hope Florida, the initiative launched by First Lady Casey DeSantis.
Hope Florida Foundation President Joshua Hay announced Thursday that Tallahassee attorney Mohammad Jazil, who had been working with the foundation on completing its delinquent paperwork, had submitted his resignation.
“I know his name has come up regarding some things but, nonetheless, in my interactions, I’ve had pleasurable, nothing short of pleasurable experiences with him working on drafting the documents, getting actions cured, and also just trying to sort of brainstorm it on how we mitigate these instances of noncompliance going. So, thank you,” Hay said.
Hay was referencing comments made by House Health Care Budget Committee Chair Rep. Alex Andrade that he was “flabbergasted” to learn Jazil was working with the foundation to produce documents nonprofits are required to produce but that the board had not. The House has been probing the finances and other problems involving the foundation.
Jazil is a private attorney who frequently represents the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis in litigation and also served as an attorney for the political committee Keep Florida Clean, which campaigned against last year’s pot-legalization proposed constitutional amendment. The committee was run by James Uthemeir, former chief of staff to Ron DeSantis. Uthemeir is now state attorney general.
The Hope Florida Foundation received a $10 million one-time “donation” from health care giant Centene, part of a $67 million settlement reached with the state for Medicaid overpayments. The foundation gave $5 million grants to Secure Florida’s Future, a nonprofit tied to the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and Save our Society another political committee. Within days, those groups made contributions to keep Florida Clean.
Hay announced Jazil’s resignation during the second part of a virtual Hope Florida Foundation board of directors meeting. He also announced the resignation of Jake Farmer from the board during the first part of the virtual meeting. Jazil and Farmer’s resignations followed news that Hope Florida director Erik Dellenback is stepping down in May.
The board’s virtual meeting was cut short  after members of the public participating posted images of Nazi symbols and pornography as well as racial slurs. Unable to control the flow of images and sounds being shared, the board recessed for several hours before reconvening.
Hay said during the second part of the meeting that he would discuss with the foundation’s accounting firm whether there was any “illicit use of funds” and, if so, look at a potential “clawback” of those funds. 
Before the forced meeting recess, Andrade told the board its nonprofit status was in jeopardy because 80% of all the funds the it had disbursed were for political purposes. “I believe that will jeopardize your 501(c)(3) status if you as the board do not take the proper steps to recoup those funds,” the Pensacola legislator told the group.

(Maskot/Getty Images)Headphones on and intently staring at his screen, Hayden sat at his table reading about ice cream. He was totally engrossed in the test’s content, his lips moving  silently with the narrator’s voice.
Some of my 5th graders  sat at single desks to better focus as they read, others wore unplugged headphones to block out noise, and still others like Hayden readied their text-to-speech (TTS) settings on their devices to begin their read-along sessions.
Each student had the tools and options they needed to be successful in this most important task: reading.
When I walked by to check on Hayden, he gave me a thumbs up as he began answering explicit and inferential questions, a tough skill for any 5th grader.
Students like Hayden with learning differences make up about 23% of all students in Arkansas. Once they’ve put in the work to learn how to use tools like TTS, the results are remarkable.
Texthelp tools like Read&Write and Equatio, which are  provided by the Arkansas Department of Education’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education, help bridge the learning and literacy gaps for  students in grades 3-12.
Research shows that students with learning differences demonstrate increased comprehension scores when using text-to-speech technology on reading tests. This includes students with a range of learning differences, including dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and vision impairment.
The Arkansas Teaching, Learning & Assessment System (ATLAS), which is administered each spring, was designed to assess students on state standards for math, science, reading, language, and writing.
Cohorts of teachers vetted the assessment prior to its adoption in the 2023-24 academic year to ensure its alignment with Arkansas standards and rigor in the question types. However, assistive technology that is part of daily instruction in a classroom like mine is not allowed on state testing for students on Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) like Hayden.
As of 2023, 30 states allow for text-to-speech access on state testing for students with documented disabilities who use such  resources in their daily learning. Arkansas should join these states so every student has the opportunity to consistently use the same assistive technology across their daily tasks and the state test that measures what they know and can do.
Providing this crucial learning tool to Arkansas students on the ATLAS test would boost their reading confidence and reduce stress associated with high-stakes testing. For example, one of my students uses speech-to-text to capture his ideas on longer writing assignments, thereby overcoming the negative impacts of dysgraphia, a neurological condition in which someone has difficulty turning their thoughts into written language. He is able to bridge this neurological barrier and successfully express himself.
Students like Hayden find success in my classroom by leveraging the tools and resources available to them, which rewards  their effort and fuels their desire to succeed. By removing the barrier for Hayden to decode words, I can evaluate what he comprehends in the writing he produces and adjust my instruction accordingly. I can also support Hayden  in improving his decoding skills through individualized reading interventions, so that he eventually won’t  need the text-to-speech tool.
Having consistency in students’ use of assistive technology also helps teachers like me, who rely on assessment data to adjust instruction and implement interventions and supports. I spend time using this data to understand the strengths and weaknesses of incoming students each fall.
If TTS is allowed on state testing, we can ensure our instructional shifts are effective and efficient from year to year.
With the support of TTS, Hayden is growing more and more confident and is able to answer complex questions at grade level. All students should have the opportunity to demonstrate their learning in a way that does not create feelings of inadequacy and failure.  Giving students access to  these tools on state tests would empower them and help them  reach their full potential.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Student-with-headphones-Getty-041825-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-18 14:10:27.278002

Avelo announced earlier this month the airline has signed a partnership for a long-term charter program with ICE.
The airline will open a base at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (AZA) in Arizona for the ICE operations beginning May 12, according to the airline. Flights will be both domestic and international to support the deportation efforts, which Avelo crews will carry out via three dedicated Boeing 737-800 aircrafts.
These charter flights will not include commercial passengers.
“We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,” Avelo Airlines Founder and CEO Andrew Levy said. “We also flew these charters under the Biden administration. Regardless of the administration or party affiliation, as a U.S. flag carrier when our country calls and requests assistance our practice is to say yes.”
It’s a move that’s lead to backlash and protests. More than 30,000 people have signed a petition started last week by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition in Connecticut. Tweed-New Haven Regional Airport (HVN) is the airline’s largest operating base.
In the aviation industry, a “base” is an airport at which an airline permanently houses aircraft and crew and operates routes. Low-cost carriers like Avelo tend to operate with a “point-to-point” network with bases, often at smaller airports to reduce costs.
A “hub” has more to do with an airline’s style of operations, as hub airports in the “hub-and-spoke” model are where airlines choose to connect passengers through — more common with full-service, legacy carriers and major airports.
Avelo’s three operating bases in North Carolina — located at Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU), Concord-Padgett Regional Airport (USA) near Charlotte, and Wilmington International Airport (ILM) — will continue to be used strictly for commercial travel, according to the airline. The agreement with ICE will not directly affect operations in North Carolina.
The airline, which had previous incarnations as charter carriers known as “Casino Express” and “Xtra Airways” was rechristened as Avelo in 2021.
Nikki Marín Baena, co-founder and co-director of the immigrant rights advocacy group Siembra NC, said the partnership could make immigrants question whether they’re safe in North Carolina.
“It just adds to that sense of stress and the sense of fear and not knowing you know what’s going to come tomorrow,” she said.
Spanish-language media outlets have covered the agreement, leading to more worries for Latino immigrants, according to Baena.
Between the three airports across the state, Avelo has plans to operate flights for more than two dozen routes from North Carolina. New additions would connect the airports with locations in Michigan, New York, and the Bahamas.
Media teams for the North Carolina airports redirected NC Newsline to Avelo.
“With this, Avelo will open a base at AZA with Avelo pilots, flight attendants and aircraft technicians, as well as appropriate local leaders. We expect to begin hiring locally for these positions immediately. Current Avelo Crewmembers (employees) will have the first option to transfer to our new AZA base,” a spokesperson for Avelo told NC Newsline in a statement.
The airline did not indicate whether any crew members from North Carolina would move to the Arizona base.
Avelo recently cancelled six flights out of Concord, WCNC reported on Friday, due to “poor performance and low bookings.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2152058571-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 13:13:12.617514

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Investors watching the stock market jump up and down more times than a 6-month-old Lab puppy in recent weeks were able to take a breath as markets closed for Good Friday.
But one day off doesn’t make up for the stress and uncertainty and expectations of more market chaos next week. Investment experts from American Century Investments, which manages the Kansas 529 Plan, offer advice heard during past market downturns — diversify.
“The only or best defense in volatile economic and market environments like this is diversification,” said Rich Weiss, senior vice president and chief investment officer, multi-asset strategies, at American Century Investments. “You never know where the ball is going to land and which investments get favored or which suffer. You know, the markets hate uncertainty. It’s anathema to the market more than anything, and this is toxic uncertainty, which is a term I borrowed from Scott Galloway.”
Weiss, who brings a dry wit to talking about investment strategies and what’s happening in the volatile stock market, offered his assessment of what the country will see with the impacts of on-again, off-again tariffs.
“Externalities, or these shocks to the market, whether they’re acts of God or acts of man — COVID, earthquakes, wars etc. — these things happen on occasion,” he said. “They’re not forecastable, necessarily, although in this particular case a lot of the volatility could properly be ascribed to the new administration. The uncertainty, specifically in this case, is really on essentially the president himself and his close advisors. And it’s not necessarily the tariff program, but it’s the process by which they’re implementing it. I hesitate to call it trade policy, because that word ‘policy’ lends a degree of credibility or validity to it, which it doesn’t seem to have. It seems a little more capricious at times.”
 
  Rich Weiss, senior vice president & chief investment officer, multi-asset strategies, American Century Investments
Market expectations uncertain
Weiss said in his 40 years in the investment world, he’s never seen the Federal Reserve Board of Governors use the term “placeholder” in their minutes.
“The Fed Governors issue forecasts as part of their job for the economy, inflation, etc.,” Weiss said. “Several of the Fed governors used the word or term — we’re going to issue a ‘placeholder’ for GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth — because even they have no idea which way this thing is going. So where do we land? We have an 85% probability right now of a slowdown or a recession. We’ve lumped them all together, so it’s not necessarily a recession but clearly an economic slowdown. I think you’re seeing that already in the numbers.”
It’s the uncertainty that makes it hard to forecast. Even United Airlines, Weiss said, came out and said it was issuing two forecasts, something rarely seen.
“Which is a place a lot of us are at because it’s so dependent on the magnitude and duration of the tariff program, and whether that indeed pushes us into a full-blown trade war with China or even some of our other allies,” he said.
Right now, many forecasters are predicting a recession, a prolonged economic decline.
 
  Evan Mayhew, vice president, national accounts, at American Century Investments, said 529 accounts offer flexibility to adapt for volatile markets. (Submitted)
529 plans offer flexibility
It’s difficult to give general advice in the current situation, but there are a couple of good rules to follow, said Weiss and Evan Mayhew, vice president, national accounts. Mayhew manages the Kansas 529 Plan.
Understanding your own tolerance for risk is important, and then diversification of stocks, bonds and other assets mean that if the market moves down in one of those areas, other investments can stabilize accounts, both said. Weiss said to consider geographical diversification, as some international markets are stronger than the U.S. market right now.
The Kansas 529 Plan, which is an investment tool to save for children’s college education, has become more flexible over the years, allowing investors to choose their level of risk, among other things, Mayhew said.
“Originally, they were set up just for college savings,” he said. “Now there’s the option for you to use it on K through 12, also for post secondary. There’s a new provision that went into effect last year that allows unused funds to be rolled into a Roth IRA. So really, it’s identifying what’s the objective of those goals and then investing appropriately.”
If 529 participants are looking at using funds to pay for kindergarten through 12th-grade educational costs, they would probably be more conservative, Mayhew said, because of a close timeframe.
“If you’ve got a longer runway, then look at something potentially more aggressive that you’re comfortable with,” he said. “We have multiple investment options.”
During economic downturns in the past, Mayhew said most clients continue their automatic payments to their 529 accounts. They typically see only a slight pull-back that corresponds to market volatility.
“We’re looking at reports on a weekly basis of investor behavior and actually over the last week, our purchases and new accounts are actually on par with last year,” he said.
Looking back at other economic downturns, such as in 2008, Mayhew said they tend to see more of a slowdown in lump-sum payments, rather than in automatic investments.
Weiss said there is a risk of “abandonment” of accounts when the economy is down, meaning customers take their money out. Sometimes they do it voluntarily, but sometimes job losses and other economic factors contribute to that decision.
 
Impossible to predict
Whether investing in a 529 Plan, mutual funds or other vehicles, the market right now is impossible to predict, Weiss said.
“It’s fraught with peril if you rush to sell or, on the other hand, buy on the dips because you could potentially catch a falling knife, as they say, by doing that,” he said. “Examine your overall asset allocation, making sure it’s still roughly in line with your specific long-term goals and objectives. These are the tried and true principles of investing. We’re not knee-jerk reacting to daily movements.”
Risk, Weiss said, is not something to consider after the markets are in a fall.

As defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, the term “hemp” is a cannabis plant with a no more than 0.3% concentration of the chemical that results in a high, known as THC.
According to the report,  which was released on Thursday, South Dakota farmers planted 3,900 acres of hemp – a 22% increase from 2023. They harvested 3,700 acres, up 27.6%. Most of that growth came from hemp grown for fiber, a product for which South Dakota reigns as the nation’s top supplier.
Texas farmers planted 4,900 acres, a 1,860% increase from last year. Only 1,500 acres of that was harvested, though.
Former Democratic state lawmaker Oren Lesmeister, a rancher from Parade, championed the bills that created South Dakota’s hemp industry. He now serves on the South Dakota Industrial Hemp Association’s board of directors. He said Texas’ numbers mean little if farmers do not have a place to process their hemp. 
“We’re kicking a– and taking names when it comes to production and processing,” Lesmeister said. 
South Dakota leads the nation in hemp processing and the production of hemp fiber, according to the report.  
There were 13.6 million pounds of hemp harvested for fiber in South Dakota last year. That’s a 14% decrease, even as the number of acres harvested,  3,550, increased by 22%. Every harvested pound was processed, according to the report. About 23% of the 59 million pounds of hemp processed in the U.S. was processed in South Dakota
The mismatch between pounds harvested and acres planted is the result of lower per-acre yields for farmers. The average yield in the state dropped sharply by 30% in 2024, to 3,840 pounds per acre. Despite that, the value of South Dakota’s fiber hemp climbed to $3.54 million, a 50% year-over-year increase, buoyed by a 73% rise in price per pound.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector) Gidley's bill that would require the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public K-12 schools passed the House on April 17, 2025.The Alabama House of Representatives Thursday passed a bill requiring public K-12 schools to display the Ten Commandments.
HB 178, sponsored by Rep. Mark Gidley, R-Hokes Bluff, passed the chamber 88-11. It requires schools to display the Ten Commandments in an entry way; a common area  an entry way or common areas like cafeterias, and in classrooms where the history of the United States is taught. The displays must be at least 11-by-14 inches in size and include text saying the commandments are “a key part of the Judeo-Christian religious and moral tradition that shaped Western Civilization and ultimately the founding of the United States,” as well as other arguments claiming they are foundational texts.

Displays would be made based on the availability of donations for them.

Gidley, a pastor, said in the House Thursday that  the country was founded on the principles of the Hebrew-derevied text, which makes it historical.
“This is about returning foundational principles to schools to be taught,” he said.
Alabama voters in 2018 approved a constitutional amendment allowing the Ten Commandments to be displayed on public property but not mandating such displays. Federal courts have allowed the displays of the Ten Commandments in historical contexts in schools but not as religious or moral displays. Local school boards do not have to use their state-allocated funds to purchase a poster to display, Gidley said. 
The legislation does not list any sanctions for schools that do not comply.
Louisiana passed similar legislation in 2024, but a federal district court ruled it unconstitutional in November, citing the separation of church and state. Louisiana’s law, unlike Gidley’s, required the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every classroom. 
Rep. Patrick Sellers, D-Pleasant Grove, was the only Democrat to support the legislation. Sellers, pastor of Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Birmingham, said the values in the Ten Commandments should be in schools.
“These are principles that our children need, and even if it’s just looking at it on the wall to remind them of what they are and how they should live from day to day,” Sellers said. “That’s what’s missing in our schools. That’s what’s missing in our homes, that’s what’s missing in our families.”
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, supported the legislation, but said putting the Ten Commandments in schools would not make more Christians. 
“As a Christian, we should be salt and light in the world. And I think that happens through relationships,” Garrett said. “But legislative mandates are not going to renew minds and change hearts.”
Rep. Marilyn Lands, D-Huntsville, said some of the commandments may not be age appropriate for young school children. 
“I think that the 10 commandments have their place, but I don’t know that we need to mandate that they be in our schools,” she said. “I think we teach our children well in our homes, and I think we have churches to teach them, but I’m not sure that they belong in our schools.”
Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said putting the Christian text in schools would disrespect other religions. 
“All I am saying is there are other faiths, those people deserve to practice whatever faith you practice,” Moore said.
The bill moves to the Senate. Sen. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, has a companion bill that was approved by the Senate Education Policy Committee last week.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-18 16:23:53+00:00,CT Mirror,"Trump is shifting cybersecurity to the states, but many aren’t prepared",Madyson Fitzgerald | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/18/trump-cybersecurity-states/,CT passed a law to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting technology investment.,"For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.” Cuts to federal resources In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added. Lawmakers step up In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”Stateline reporter Madyson Fitzgerald can be reached at mfitzgerald@stateline.org.

CHICAGO — Federal agents asked state Sen. Emil Jones III to wear a wire against a politically connected hospital CEO and his fellow lawmakers in Springfield, the senator testified Thursday in his own defense at his federal corruption trial.

Jones, D-Chicago, said he was prepared to cooperate with the FBI in a widespread investigation into public corruption in Illinois and attended a handful of meetings with agents and prosecutors with the intent to do so before he ultimately was charged in September 2022.

But the agents, Jones said, asked him “to do things that I was not willing to do” — including wearing a wire. The senator struggled to articulate the other requests the agents made, even after U.S. District Judge Andrea Wood stepped in to restate his attorney’s question.

“Wearing a wire and — I don’t know how to describe it, judge,” Jones said.

The senator took the witness stand for a third day Thursday in his trial over alleged bribes he agreed to take from a red-light camera entrepreneur-turned-FBI witness in exchange for limiting legislation he had proposed that worried the red-light camera industry — and lying to agents about it.

Not too long into questioning from his own attorney, Jones’ testimony was halted for more than an hour after he named Tim Egan, the CEO of Chicago’s Roseland Hospital in Jones’ South Side District, as someone the feds wanted him to help investigate.

""Agent (Timothy) O’Brien basically instructed me that he wanted me to wear a wire on Tim Egan and he wanted me to come up with a scenario to entrap Tim Egan,” Jones said.

Prosecutors immediately objected, which was followed by a lengthy sidebar discussion between Wood and attorneys on both sides. The arguments were intentionally masked by loud white noise in the courtroom, but Wood ultimately told jurors to disregard Jones’ answer and the senator’s lawyer, Vic Henderson, told his client to refrain from “naming names.”

Egan, who’s spent nearly a decade as a Cook County Democratic Party committeeman, has not been charged with any crimes. But Roseland Hospital has been mentioned several times throughout the trial.

Jones apparently made unsuccessful efforts to get his former intern hired there in the summer of 2019, though the senator instead connected him with Omar Maani, a co-founder of Chicago-based red-light camera company SafeSpeed. Maani, who was cooperating with the government, hired the former intern, Christopher Katz, which the feds say constituted part of a bribe.

Roseland Hospital also threw Jones an annual campaign fundraiser, which in 2019 was scheduled for August at a White Sox game. With his FBI-provided recording devices rolling during a dinner the month before, Maani offered Jones a contribution for the event. Eventually, the senator named a number — “five grand” — which became the other purported bribe Jones allegedly agreed to.

Prosecutors say it doesn’t matter that Maani never gave Jones any money or that Jones never amended his legislation in the way Maani wanted him to, the agreement is what counts.

But Jones said that while he was suspicious of Maani and his “used-car salesman” vibe, he fully believed that he and Maani never made an agreement. He said the same to FBI agents when they knocked on his door the morning of Sept. 24, 2019, who told him they were investigating his colleague, then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago, who’d connected him to Maani earlier that summer.

Five months later, however, Jones’ attorney received a letter from the U.S. Attorney’s office informing him that charges were imminent. In February 2019, Jones sat down with the feds twice within the span of a week. That’s when he was asked to wear a wire on Egan after identifying different people in photos and initialing them.

They also showed Jones “snippets” of Maani’s secretly recorded videos, he said.

But then the COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench into Jones’s plans for cooperating with the government. On Thursday, the senator noted he wasn’t “able to go to restaurants and eat dinner with folks,” which limited opportunities for covert FBI operations.

The next time Jones met with FBI agents was in September 2021, when he and his then-lawyer were allowed to listen to all of the recordings Maani had made in addition to tape of the FBI agents’ interview with Jones on which the feds allege the senator lied.

Jones on Thursday said he left that meeting knowing “I was gonna fight these charges,” which were still a year away from being filed. The senator said that after spending eight or so hours listening to the tapes, he “felt the government was misleading me” in the February 2020 meeting when they played selected portions of the recordings.

""You hear Omar basically trying to set me up,” Jones said of Maani. “And you hear me pushing back on him, trying to change the subject, all that.”

Over the next 12 months, Jones met with the feds three more times. The senator testified that the FBI was still hoping he’d agree to wear a wire during both a February 2022 Zoom videoconference and a downtown Chicago meeting in June of that year.

Asked Thursday why he kept attending the meetings even though he’d already decided to fight the charges, Jones said he did so at the direction of his lawyer — and because he was worried the feds would charge him before the November 2022 election, though he ran unopposed.

“Did you expect to hear anything different?” his lawyer Henderson asked.

""Only thing I did hear were things that I was not willing to do,” Jones said. “Wear wires on my colleagues.”

“And why were you not willing to wear a wire?” Henderson asked.

Jones exhaled deeply before answering.

“Because — if,” he said before sighing again. “I don’t know how to answer that question.”

Feds persist in their pursuit of Jones

The senator met with the feds one final time in August 2022 in a brief meeting in which he was informed the government was moving forward with plans to charge him.

Jones was charged on three counts the following month, but in November of that year, he was reelected to a four-year term in the General Assembly.

The senator was stripped of his committee chairmanship and leadership roles in the Senate but has refused to step down in the last 2 ½ years. The last sitting lawmaker who took his federal corruption case to trial was then-state Rep. Derrick Smith, D-Chicago, in 2014. And the last state official to take the witness stand at their own trial was then-state Rep. Patricia Bailey, D-Chicago, in 2005. Both were convicted.

Deciding to testify in his own defense was a risky move, as it opened Jones up to grueling cross-examination from prosecutors. Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany Ardam on Thursday attempted over and over to impeach the senator’s prior testimony, pointing out inconsistencies between the previously played secret recordings and what Jones told the jury.

Ardam questioned why Jones would portray what the government showed to him at one of the February 2020 meetings as “information shared with you” and act as if the “snippets” the agents showed were a surprise.

“The truth is you were at all of these meetings,” Ardam said.

“Yes,” Jones said.

“So you know everything that was said,” Ardam said.

“I can’t remember everything that was said,” Jones replied.

At one of those February 2020 meetings, prosecutors and one of the case agents have already told the jury that Jones acknowledged making an agreement with Maani, contrary to what he told the FBI in September 2019.

Read more: Feds set to rest case in Sen. Emil Jones III red-light camera bribery trial

The senator earlier Thursday told his own attorney a few different times that he never signed or initialed a document indicating that he was recanting his previous statements.

But Ardam waded into that territory herself.

“And you acknowledged you made a deal with Omar Maani,” she said.

“No. I. Did. Not,” Jones answered.

Ardam cast doubt on Jones’ earlier explanation on the witness stand that even though Maani made him “uncomfortable,” he still met with him because he was following a directive from Sandoval. As chair of the Senate Transportation committee, Sandoval had blocked Jones’ bill that called for a study of red-light camera systems across the state.

Jones had called Sandoval “intimidating” and “a bully” — but Ardam pointed out that in the recording of the dinner where between him, Sandoval and Maani at a suburban steakhouse in June 2025, they were cracking jokes and seemed relaxed.

""You were only intimidated by him at times?” Ardam asked.

""Yes,” Jones answered.

Later, Ardam asked whether Jones had trepidation about dealing with Sandoval in other ways.

“I never said I was scared of Senator Sandoval,” Jones said. “I said he could be a bully at times and he could be intimidating. I was never scared of him.”

Ardam also pointed out that Jones’ contention earlier in his testimony that Sandoval was arrested on Sept. 24, 2019, wasn’t true; in fact, federal agents had executed search warrants on his home and offices. He began cooperating and later pleaded guilty to bribery and tax fraud charges.

Jones held to his repeated claim, seemingly confused by her questions.

“And you know he’s no longer with us, he’s deceased,” Ardam said. “So you know that he can’t dispute anything you're saying today?”

“Yes,” Jones replied.

But Ardam had some mixups of her own. To catch Jones in a lie over his claim Wednesday that he’d never had one of his bills die on the Senate floor, the prosecutor pointed out that in 2019, roughly 30 bills that Jones had introduced died at the end of session. As Jones attempted to tell her, that’s different than the rare and fairly embarrassing scenario in which a senator allows for a bill to be called for a vote only to see it fail to garner the minimum number of votes for passage.

Ardam also spent time suggesting that Jones benefitted from nepotism as his father, Emil Jones Jr., had been a longtime legislator and served as president of the Illinois Senate from 2003 until 2009.

“You were elected in 2008?” Ardam asked, after reminding the jury of Jones’ testimony that “ever since I was a child,” he’d wanted to be a state senator like his father.

“Yes,” Jones said.

“You didn’t tell the jury how that happened, did you?” Ardam said, before falsely asserting that Jones was appointed to his father’s seat when the elder Jones announced his retirement in August 2008.

“Well I replaced him on the ballot,” the senator explained.

“So somebody had to replace him in the Senate,” Ardam said. “Were you appointed to fill your father’s seat from August 2008 to November 2008?”

“No,” Jones said.

“You were not?” Ardam asked skeptically.

Jones and his father caught heat when the Senate president withdrew from the ballot after he’d won his 2008 primary election and later withdrew from the ballot and advocated for his son to replace him. But Jones III wasn’t sworn in to the Senate until January 2009 after his father’s term officially ended.

After acknowledging to jurors that trial has stretched longer than originally planned, Judge Wood canceled trial on Good Friday while the attorneys work through final jury instructions. Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday.

Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez held his mother in a tight embrace and wept following his release from the Leon County Jail Thursday evening, where the U.S. citizen was held after his arrest for illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien.”
An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.
The pair didn’t reunite until the evening, after Lopez-Gomez’s first court appearance earlier in the day. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans ruled Thursday morning that she lacked jurisdiction to release him because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him for 48 hours.
After Riggans’ inspection of his Social Security card and birth certificate, which an advocate waved in the courtroom, the judge said she found no probable cause for the charge.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
The arrest record the trooper filed states that Lopez-Gomez had said he was in the country illegally but that he had handed over his ID. There was no mention of the Social Security card on the arrest report. However, Lopez-Gomez told the Phoenix he had shown the trooper a copy of his Social Security card and Georgia state ID.
The HSI agent who took Lopez-Gomez to Wendy’s directed questions to a spokesperson, who didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment or questions as of this publication.

After the reunion with his mom, Lopez-Gomez returned to the parking lot of the jail, where 30 protesters had been demanding his release. They met him with cheers and hugs.
Lopez-Gomez will have to return to the Leon County Courthouse on May 6. He was charged under a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention.
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also made their first appearances on the same charge on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)A national real estate company will have to pay back nearly $100,000 in fees charged to local residents who applied to live at any of its Rhode Island housing properties under a settlement announced Thursday by the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General.
The agreement comes four months after the AG’s office sued A.R. Building Co. in state Superior Court, alleging the Philadelphia company violated consumer protection laws by forcing prospective tenants to pay “excessive” application and screening fees. 
The state’s December lawsuit alleged the company violated Rhode Island’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act and a new state law which took effect on Jan. 1 that limits fees landlords can charge to prospective tenants. The 19-page complaint lists three anonymous consumers — identified as A, B, and C — as examples, but the AG’s office estimates nearly 400 applicants paid fees during the 13-month timeframe of the complaint, said Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for the AG.
The state also claimed in its complaint that the company violated state and federal fair housing protections by requiring a more difficult application process for applicants with disabilities.
As part of the settlement, which resolves all components of the complaint, A.R. Building will also pay $114,750 to the state for a total monetary compensation of $213,000. And, it has agreed to stop charging application fees to residents looking to live in any of its five local housing complexes, while allowing prospective tenants to avoid screening fees by submitting their own documents as part of the application.
“We will hold accountable any entity that attempts to take advantage of consumers by implementing illegal barriers to finding a home, a practice made all the more egregious by the fact that we are in the midst of a severe housing crisis,” Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement. “With this settlement, not only are we returning nearly $100,000 to Rhode Island consumers, we are barring this company from further engaging in behaviors that we allege are illegal and discriminatory. We must make it easier, not harder, for people to obtain safe, affordable housing, and that’s why my Office will continue to hold accountable bad actors who place profits over people. Let this settlement serve as a warning to those who may still be engaging in illegal housing practices; we won’t stand for it, and we won’t hesitate to take further action.”
Michael Gamboli, a partner at Partridge Snow & Hahn LLP in Providence representing A.R. Building Co., did not immediately return inquiries for comment Friday.
The company owns more than 800 apartments, condominiums and townhouses across five complexes in Rhode Island: East Providence’s Kettle Point and Newport Avenue Apartments, Dowling Village in Smithfield, Highland Hills in Cumberland and Reynolds Farm in North Kingstown.
State residents who paid application or administrative fees as part of an application to any of the local properties from Jan. 1 2024 to Jan. 30, 2025, should contact the property manager where they applied to receive a refund. Applicants have until July 1 to claim their refunds; unclaimed money will be donated to the Special Olympics of Rhode Island.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
Budget restrictions, staff issues and AI are threats to states’ cybersecurity

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.



The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Governments often struggle with massive new IT projects

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
Rhode Island state government hit by major cyberattack

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.


New Mexico developed a three-year cybersecurity plan, which it published in 2023. The plan includes four long-term goals:
• to manage and monitor information systems, data and networks
• to enhance cybersecurity resilience
• to develop statewide cybersecurity and risk management strategies
• to train and develop the cybersecurity workforce
 


In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) is calling on nature lovers to help protect some of the state’s most vulnerable shorebirds, including the federally threatened piping plover and the state-endangered American oystercatcher.
DNREC’s Division of Fish and Wildlife will host a training session for prospective volunteers from 10 a.m. to noon on Saturday, May 3, at the Officers Club Mess Hall in Cape Henlopen State Park.
The training is part of the agency’s annual effort to monitor and safeguard beach-nesting birds during the busy summer season.
Volunteers play a key role in DNREC’s conservation strategy, acting as on-the-ground monitors at designated nesting areas along Delaware’s beaches.
Their primary task is to educate the public about temporary beach closures and the importance of minimizing human disturbances that can threaten the nesting success of shorebirds.
The training will kick off with refreshments and a slideshow presentation, followed by a discussion about the monitoring program and volunteer responsibilities.
If weather allows, participants will also have the chance to head out to the Point at Cape Henlopen to spot shorebirds in their natural habitat. Binoculars will be provided, though attendees are encouraged to bring their own.
Submitting an interest form ahead of time is encouraged, but walk-ins are welcome. Park entrance fees will be waived for all training participants.

(Photo illustration from Getty Images)All that glitters is not gold.
Republican leaders are proposing three separate bills to give gambling a stronghold in South Carolina — one to legalize casinos and two to legalize online sports betting. A House Ways and Means subcommittee will consider two of them Tuesday.
The casino bill, H. 4176, is authored by Rep. Gary Brewer and co-sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Weston Newton and House Labor, Commerce, and Industry Chairman Bill Herbkersman, among others.
The online sports betting bills, S. 444 and H. 3625, are authored by Republicans.
Low-income individuals always get the brunt end of gambling because their financial stress makes them more prone to the risk of repeated gambling that leads to addiction.
In that sense, jobs are created by plundering the most vulnerable of our neighbors.
When video poker proliferated in South Carolina in the 1990s, we learned all too painfully about the increase in bankruptcy, domestic violence, divorce, mental health issues, and even suicide.
In turn, taxpayers bear the burden of those costs as the state must intervene with welfare, health care, criminal justice and the like, while the gambling profiteers dance their way to the bank.
Do we really want towns like Biloxi, Mississippi, in South Carolina, that are havens for crime and corruption?
I hope we learned our lesson with video poker.
The opening paragraph of the casino bill says, “The General Assembly finds that casino gaming is not consistent with nor compatible with the economic, labor, or tourism industry profile for most communities in South Carolina.”
I couldn’t agree more — but would say that principle applies to the entire state.
Casinos are predatory and placing one in Santee or along the economically depressed Interstate 95 corridor blatantly disregards the social disparities faced by our neighbors in that part of the state.
Consider a 2012 report in The Washington Post, citing a study’s findings that while casinos created jobs, they also “lead to a plethora of social ills, including increased substance abuse, mental illness and suicide, violent crime, auto theft and larceny, and bankruptcy. The latter three all increased by 10% in communities that allowed gambling.”
In addition to the social costs, casinos provide cover to sex traffickers as “casino crowds and co-located lodging facilities — coupled with the transient nature of sex trafficking — provide convenience and cover for sex traffickers,” wrote Dave Vialpando, a veteran law enforcement officer.
I-95 has long been cited as the main north-south route for smuggling drugs and human trafficking. A casino along this corridor would only exacerbate these problems.
While some may regard casinos as the dark underbelly of Big Gambling, its close cousin — online sports betting — seeks to cast itself as the more cultured, sophisticated form of gambling.
While online sports betting is illegal in South Carolina, none of us are naïve enough to believe that people in the Palmetto State aren’t doing it.
There are certainly ways to get around state law, but that — in and of itself — should not be a reason for us to dive headlong into an arena that has high costs.
Gambling in the privacy of your home on your iPhone or laptop is easy. Combine the convenience and accessibility of online gambling with sports and you have a potent combination.
Robert Strezo with The Center for Public Justice states, “Sports betting is having an enormous impact on society, and it is disproportionately impacting the lives of young men who are less risk-averse and interested in sports. Nearly 60 percent of 18 to 22-year-olds have bet on sports and 20-year-old males represent about 40% of the calls to hotlines for gambling addiction. The targeting of college youth, who often have access to financial aid — which can be redirected to fund their addiction — has compounded the burden of college debt with gambling debts and the costs of addiction therapy.”
Because of its very nature, it disproportionately affects young men.
According to a January 2024 study, 72% of sports bettors are young men.
Ultimately, there is neither a strong social nor fiscal argument for South Carolina to pursue casinos or online sports betting.
In addition to these and other concerns, Palmetto Family is committed to a biblical worldview that calls us to pursue human flourishing.
South Carolina is at a crossroads: We can either choose to pursue the “glitter” of gambling or embrace the core Judeo-Christian values of hard work, productivity, and using the fruits of God’s provision to meet our needs, the needs of other South Carolinians and expanding and invest to continue to make South Carolina a great place to live, work and raise a family.

(Video capture courtesy of the Iowa Supreme Court)  The Iowa Supreme Court has removed from the bench a magistrate who questioned the veracity of an alleged sexual assault victim because he was a teenage male and asked whether a defendant in a separate case was a “wetback.”
Magistrate David J. Hanson, who is based in Fayette County and has practiced law for more than 36 years, is “simply and unalterably unsuited to be a judge,” and is “unable to preside over any proceeding involving a sexual assault,” the court ruled on Friday.
Its decision to remove Hanson from the bench takes effect in 10 days, assuming Hanson has not resigned before then.
In March, the justices heard oral arguments in the disciplinary proceedings against Hanson. The Iowa Judicial Qualifications Commission, which hears complaints about judges’ conduct, had recommended that the justices suspend Hanson for 90 days due to his conduct in two separate criminal matters.
On Aug. 5, 2022, he refused to sign an arrest warrant for a 17-year-old girl in a sexual abuse case in which the alleged victim was a 15-year-old male. According to court records, Hanson reviewed the matter and denied the warrant, writing that “any self-respecting young male” would have simply removed himself from any sexual touching that was truly unwelcome and he described his own response as a teenager to “unwelcome” sexual advances.
Hanson went on to write that as a teenage boy, the alleged victim’s actions were “contrary to nature” because the “normal, hormone-ridden teenage boy’s reaction to being undressed by a teenage girl” is, “Alright! I’m gonna GET some!” His written decision then went into graphic detail about the physiology of the male sex organ.
In July 2023, Hanson was presiding over a case in which an individual was charged with driving without a license or insurance. A law-student intern who was prosecuting the case later complained that during the proceedings Hanson asked, “Is this guy a wetback? An illegal?”
According to the commission, Hanson also asked whether the prosecutor was sure the defendant, who wasn’t present at the time, hadn’t stolen someone’s identification.
Hanson says use of slur was once ‘common’
At last month’s hearing before the Iowa Supreme Court, Hanson told the justices that with regard to the allegations made by the victim in the sexual abuse case, “I honestly thought, ‘This is a lie. It reads like bad pornography.’ I hate pornography. Pornography is lies … I still, to this day, am convinced that the arrest warrant request, the complaint, was resting on lies.”
At the time, Chief Justice Susan Christensen appeared to bristle at Hanson’s comment and questioned his equation of pornography with lies.

“Sir, are you aware that things that happen to people are pornographic in nature? And sometimes, in order for there to be an arrest warrant, someone might have to give details that are really ugly to give (and) heartbreaking to hear? Just because you’re giving the adjective ‘porn’ — what if those things actually happened to that person? Because it qualifies as porn in your mind and you hate porn, you think it’s a lie?”
“I seriously questioned it,” Hanson replied. “The other problem I had was the utter lack of interest, as far as I could tell, in the policeman attempting to corroborate what the young man said.”
Hanson then likened the decision he faced in that case with what he called the “travesty” of the testimony that was given during the U.S. Supreme Court nomination hearings for conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, and for Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991.
“Those were lies,” Hanson said, pounding the podium as he addressed the Iowa justices. “Televised lies! And I was appalled by that, and I thought, ‘I will not be an instrument of anyone seeking to destroy someone without any backing up of what (the alleged victim) said here.’”
As to the second matter involving the case in which Hanson used the term “wetback,” Christensen asked Hanson, “Do you think the term ‘wetback’ is offensive?”
“I’ve learned since using it that it is,” Hanson said. “I grew up in west side, working class Waterloo, and it was fairly common.”
Christensen cut Hanson off, shaking her head and telling him, “You definitely, that one, I am gonna call ‘foul’ on that, that you didn’t know it was offensive.” Hanson told the justices he was agreeable to taking whatever educational courses the court might prescribe for him but asked that he not be removed from the bench due to the heavy caseloads in Fayette County.
Justices remove Hanson from the bench 
In the decision Friday to remove Hanson from the bench, Justice Dana Oxley, writing for the full court, stated that “it should go without saying that the term ‘w——‘ is a racially derogatory, highly offensive slur that does not belong in a courtroom — and especially not from the mouth of a judge … We cannot overemphasize how inappropriate it was for Magistrate Hanson to use the slur … Rather than recognize the term as the racial epithet that it is, he labels it as ‘someone’s taboo’ that he ‘apparently’ transgressed.”
In deciding that Hanson’s conduct warranted not just a suspension but his removal from the bench, the court stated that if Hanson “cannot recognize bias or prejudice in his own conduct, we cannot trust him to recognize it in those he is tasked with policing,” referring to attorneys and other officers of the court.
Hanson, the court added, “has not shown regret for his choice of words. He has not shown genuine remorse for the effect his statements likely had on the litigants. He has shown no aptitude for self-improvement. Indeed, he suggested in his brief that the commission simply provide him with a list of ‘bad words’ so that he can avoid them in conversation.”
With regard to the sexual assault case, the court found that Hanson is “unable to preside over any proceeding involving a sexual assault,” and noted that in a written brief, Hanson had explained his view of sexual assault allegations by writing, “All judges should know, and fear, false accusations of sexual crimes alleged long after the supposed events. I witnessed the televised atrocities visited upon U.S. Supreme Court Justice nominees … by women whom effective cross examinations showed to be telling falsehoods. I will never abet such ‘high-tech lynchings.’ ”
The justices stated Hanson’s remarks were “not those of an independent, impartial arbiter carefully considering whether the allegations provided in the affidavit before him supplied probable cause to support an arrest warrant.

ST. MARY PARISH —  Amid the rapid erosion of Louisiana’s coast, something hopeful is happening where the Atchafalaya River meets the Gulf. A flow of sediment from a decades-old river diversion has accidentally given birth to new wetlands.
While that small delta is dwarfed by what’s washing away all around it, researchers have gained knowledge from Wax Lake Delta that could help save the rest of Louisiana’s coast and contribute to a better understanding of wetland science across the globe. 
“We have sea level rise, we have storms, but yet … the Wax Lake Delta remains and continues to grow and reach out into the Atchafalaya Basin,” said Alisha Renfro, a coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation.
Researchers at Louisiana State University’s Coastal Systems Ecology Lab, led by wetland scientist and professor Robert Twilley, take regular trips to Wax Lake to study what makes a healthy wetland. They monitor soil chemistry and study the way water moves throughout the delta, depositing sediment and building land as it flows. 
 This story is part of the series “Down the Drain” from the Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk, an independent reporting collaborative based at the University of Missouri in partnership with Report for America, with major funding from the Walton Family Foundation.
“Wax Lake has this beautiful, long history of researchers that literally wrote the textbook on what is a delta based on that region,” Twilley said. 

Rather than having to rely on computer modeling for their research, Wax Lake is known as a “living laboratory,” said Renfro, describing it as the perfect place to study what makes a healthy wetland. 
A happy accident
During a research trip on a bright February morning, alligators meandered through the marshy channels of the Wax Lake Delta, part of the Atchafalaya Wildlife Management Area. The scientists were happy to see them. The presence of so many apex predators in the muddy water is a testament to the health of the ecosystem, said Jessica Richardson, a data manager working with Twilley at LSU in the Coastal Sciences department.
White ibises gathered together on the land, and schools of silvery fish darted through the dark water.
“You’ve got different wildlife nesting, laying eggs, such as alligators … and birds that fly, that come in during different seasons and nest,” Twilley said.

Deltas are formed from sediment that collects at the end of a river, like the Mississippi or Atchafalaya. Over time, this sediment builds, creating new land and using nutrients carried by the river to grow vegetation, the roots of which stabilize the new soil and keep it from eroding. 
Deltaic wetlands are uniquely diverse and ecologically valuable. When a river flows into the delta, “it’s not just water,” said Ivan Vargas-Lopez, a wetland scientist and researcher with the Coastal Systems Ecology Lab. 
“It’s bringing a lot of nutrients, a lot of sediment, a lot of particles, a lot of material …” Vargas-Lopez said. “When the water recedes, a lot of that material stays.” 
This process can happen naturally over thousands of years, but the new land built from Wax Lake happened by mistake. 
“[Wax Lake] teaches us about the balance, that if you supply the right amount of 
sediment into an environment, that you outweigh the influence of subsidence and sea level. You will be able to establish and maintain a healthy ecosystem,” said Ehab Meselhe, a river and coastal scientist at Tulane University. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dug a channel in 1941 to try to reduce flooding in nearby Morgan City, redirecting the flow of water from the Atchafalaya. This started the process of sediment buildup, noticed only after a massive flood in 1973 flushed a torrent of dirt down the river. 
For Wax Lake, land is built through flooding. Floods bring in great heaps of sediment, spreading it out across the floodplain in a lobelike shape at the end of the river. 
“Under that water, you’re building a delta, and all of a sudden it sort of … pops up,” Twilley said.  
Over time, the process forms the wetlands so important to the integrity of Louisiana’s coast.

Reversing wetland loss
Subsidence, or the slow sinking of land, paired with ongoing oil and gas development and sea level rise caused by climate change is erasing Louisiana’s coastal wetlands — and fast. These wetlands are some of the most vulnerable in the world, with much of the coast washing away at a rate of about a football field every 100 minutes, endangering cities, towns and livelihoods all along the coast. 
Wax Lake Delta bucks this trend, with one estimate from LSU researchers suggesting land grows by about half a square mile a year. Louisiana officials and researchers are scrambling to respond to the wetland crisis and using Wax Lake’s land-building success to inform other coastal restoration efforts, such as marsh creation, manmade oyster reefs and rebuilding barrier islands. 
Meselhe used data from Wax Lake Delta in his work on the Mid-Barataria sediment diversion project, which would redirect the Mississippi River into the Barataria Basin to reverse land loss in coastal parishes. The diversion has been highly controversial due to its impact on fisheries, and it’s facing delays and legal challenges. 
The Wax Lake Delta data helped him to understand how the interaction between water flow, sediment buildup and plant growth worked to build land. He also looked at how land is being built by another diversion called West Bay and at the Bonnet Carré spillway to see how the diversion would impact the river itself. Then he used that information to calibrate models to help explain how Mid-Barataria would work. 
 “Wax Lake, West Bay and Bonnet Carré served as examples because they had data and measurements and maps over a number of years that helped us to have confidence and trust in the models we ended up using for the Mid-Barataria area,” he said.  
The LSU Center for River Studies houses a massive model of the Mississippi River in its Baton Rouge facility, built using data including water velocity and sediment concentrations observed at Wax Lake and other Louisiana deltas. Researchers and students use it to test how sediment moves with the Mississippi River and where it’s deposited.  
Physical models are useful and necessary; the Army Corps has used them since the early 20th century. But Twilley said field observations like those done at Wax Lake are crucial. 
“Models are not to do your thinking. Models are to help you think,” he said. “Once we build these models of the way we think these systems work and the way they operate, you know, it’s great to go visit somewhere else and see if your hypothesis stands or not.”
Added benefits of a healthy wetland
As scientists study how Wax Lake builds land, they can also better understand the added benefits of healthy wetlands, such as natural carbon storage and nutrient reduction.
Because Wax Lake has been building wetlands for decades, Twilley’s lab can compare older and newer areas of marsh. 
“The older delta does a much better job at holding the soil and serving as a hurricane protection system than the younger,” he said. 
Mature wetlands also store massive amounts of carbon in organic matter, found in dead plants. Buried in the marsh, they keep microorganisms from eating the carbon and releasing it as planet-warming CO2. Wetlands also filter excess nitrogen out of the water, sequestering it before it reaches the Gulf and contributes to harmful algal blooms and the “dead zone.”
That’s one of the reasons it’s important to protect existing wetlands, Twilley said. Their systems are already established and don’t have to play catch up. 
“You gotta let these deltas age before they really reach their full capacity,” he said. “You will get a jump start by already having some wetlands out there.”

An uncertain future
While the science is clear – wetlands have lots of benefits and we know how to build more of them – the future is not. America’s wetlands are under increased threat. After hundreds of years of draining them for agriculture and housing—and historic efforts to protect them—regulations are now being rolled back.  
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that wetlands covered about 6% of the lower 48 states as of 2019 – about half the amount of wetlands that existed around 1780.
The report also found that the rate of wetland loss increased 50% during the latest study period. Wetlands are now being lost faster than ever, from a combination of drainage for agriculture, development and the effects of climate change. 
Louisiana’s coastal wetlands make up about 40% of all coastal marshes in the United States, according to a series of reports from the U.S. Geological Survey conducted throughout the 1980s and finished in 1996, which found that “wetlands once covered more than one-half of the area that is now Louisiana, but wetland acreage has declined to less than one-third of the state’s land surface over the last 200 years.”
Changes at the federal level could also increase risk of continued wetland loss. 
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to redefine what are designated in federal law as Waters of the United States, sometimes called WOTUS. The changes affect what qualifies as a federally protected body of water under the Clean Water Act. 
The fate of the Mississippi River’s precious wetlands hangs in the balance. 
Research on Wax Lake Delta illustrates that wetlands are more important than ever. Renfro said that’s why it’s critical to take these lessons and use them to build more wetlands. 
“At the end of the day, reconnecting the river with those wetlands it once built is kind of the consistent way to build robust, healthy coastal ecosystems that continue to grow.”

South Carolina public school buses Monday Oct. 30, 2023.(Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)A 13-year-old boy was killed when a bus flipped over on Interstate 77 in Chester County on Thursday.
Jose Maria Gonzales Linares, a Pine Ridge Middle School student, died in the crash, Chester County Coroner Terry Tinker said Friday.
Three buses from the middle school were returning to the Lexington County school after a field trip near Charlotte, according to a Lexington School District Two news release.
A tire blew on the bus, which was carrying about 35 students and three adults, causing it to swerve, hit a guard rail and flip, according to the state Highway Patrol, which is investigating the crash.
The two buses that were following the bus that flipped “maneuvered to avoid the accident,” injuring several people on those buses, the district said in a news release.
Emergency services took 38 people to local hospitals, said Ed Darby, director of Chester County Emergency Management. That included three people airlifted to hospitals in helicopters, he said.
Darby did not have information on how many had been released as of Friday morning, or how many people were considered in critical condition, he said.
Highway Patrol and Lexington School District Two also had no new information to release Friday morning, spokespeople said.
Pine Ridge Middle School listed an eighth grade field trip on its online calendar Thursday, but the district has not said where the field trip was.
“Our hearts are broken by the tragic bus accident in Chester County this afternoon,” state Superintendent Ellen Weaver said in a statement. “Our entire state is mourning alongside the Pine Ridge Middle School families, friends, classmates, and educators. Please join me in praying for the Lexington Two community.”
Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that he and his wife, Peggy McMaster, were both praying for the students injured in the bus crash.
“Today’s school bus accident in Chester County is a tragedy no family should ever have to endure,” McMaster wrote.
Fatal school bus crashes are relatively rare in South Carolina. In 2022, the most recent data available, four people died in collisions involving school buses, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SC42-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 12:24:51.264178

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)“If I had my way, I’d take the tax out,” Republican Assemblymember P.K. O’Neill said last month about the state commerce tax paid by Nevada businesses.
It’s not a bad idea.
The commerce tax was crafted by quasi-governmental fixture, consultant to the publicly subsidized stars, and lobbyist in denial Jeremy Aguero at the request of then-Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval for the 2015 Nevada legislative session. 
The measure, which was enacted with bipartisan support, applies small levies well south of 1% (between 0.051% and 0.331%, depending on the industry) on the gross receipts of businesses that collect an annual revenue of more than $4 million.
O’Neill and Republican Assemblymember Jill Dickman are sponsoring a bill to have the $4 million exemption grow with inflation, effectively expanding the exemption a little more each year, and capturing a few less businesses in the process. It would have a negligible impact on state revenues and Nevada businesses alike in the short term, though the impact on state revenue would compound over time. 
Only seven states levy a tax on gross revenue. States name them differently — “corporate activity tax” (Oregon), “franchise tax” (Texas), “commerce tax” (Nevada), etc. — but tax policy think tanks such as the Tax Foundation and the Tax Policy Center categorize them collectively as a “gross receipts” tax.
And the center-right Tax Foundation, in particular, is not fond of gross receipts taxes at all.
Among the many faults the group finds in “this harmful tax,” perhaps the most pernicious is “tax pyramiding” — a good or service gets taxed again and again by every business at every step in the market process.
That “continual forward shifting of the tax burden” ultimately results in consumers paying higher prices.
Nevada consumers already pay higher sales tax rates than people in most of the rest of the country, which makes inflation hit households in Nevada harder than in other states (and is yet another reason Nevadans will also be hit harder by Trump’s tariffs than people in most other states). Nevada’s commerce tax exacerbates the problem.
  Nevada’s commerce tax on business is a wee slice. Nevada’s sales tax on working households is like a big honking third of the whole stinking pie. (Pie: Nevada Economic Forum)
Price increases driven by commerce tax pyramiding also make the tax regressive — the lower a household’s income, the higher the percentage of that income is paid as a tax. That’s in keeping with Nevada’s upside down tax structure in general, which is notorious for being one of the nation’s most regressive.
“Nevada’s Commerce Tax is a prime example of a state with a poorly structured and legally tenuous gross receipts tax,” the Tax Foundation wrote in a 2024 overview of taxes on gross receipts in the U.S. The group singled out the aforementioned $4 million exemption for “eliminating many small and medium-sized businesses in Nevada from the Commerce Tax altogether.” 
(The “legally tenuous” bit refers to an “in-state payroll” quirk in the tax that could make it ripe for challenge under the U.S. Constitution clause granting Congress the authority to regulate commerce between the states. But since Republicans who control Congress have relinquished power over everything and anything in deference to Trump’s authority, that potential constitutional transgression is unlikely to be anyone’s concern anytime soon.)
“Gross receipt taxes” such as Nevada’s commerce tax “can and should be left in the dustbin of history,” the Tax Foundation asserts.
“If states intend to levy a broad-based business tax,” the group’s overview concludes, “a properly corporate income tax that allows businesses to deduct the cost of goods sold, as well as qualifying business investments and inputs,” which would curb tax pyramiding, you see, “is — while far from an ideal tax — demonstrably better than a tax on gross receipts.”
Yeah well we won’t be doing that
When O’Neill, who previously has struggled to grasp the meaning of regressive taxation, says he’d like to “take the tax out,” he assuredly doesn’t mean he would like to replace it with a corporate income tax.
But ridding the state of its commerce tax without replacing it with something smarter would leave a projected $760 million hole in state revenue over the next two years.
The damage that Trump and Elon Musk have recklessly inflicted on federal programs and services is as yet still incalculable, and the prospect of repairing what they have broken is still unknown. 
What is known, however, is that states that stand the best chance of maintaining a semblance of vital public services will be those states with a history of at least trying to adequately fund and staff state and local government. 
Nevada isn’t one of them.
And barring a currently unthinkable outbreak of sense and sensibility among Trump and his congressional Republicans, Nevada will likely be facing intense budget challenges over the next two years, especially with diminished Medicaid funding, yet another thing that is projected to hit Nevada harder than most states. 
Nevada can’t “take the tax out.” 
And it can’t replace it with a corporate income tax, for the same reason Sandoval and Aguero came up with gross receipts tax ten years ago. Sure, it was convoluted, unfamiliar, and wracked with bizarre industrial tax rate variations that were inexplicable from a policy standpoint but grossly obvious from a political one (oh hi mining). And, if memory serves, opponents at the time warned of the tax pyramiding problem.
But the big attraction about the commerce tax is that as blunt and flawed and silly as it so obviously was/is, it wasn’t that one tax that Nevada politicians of both parties are horrified to entertain, let alone make an argument or — perish the thought — vote for: It wasn’t an income tax.
Technically, it is true that Nevada can replace its gross receipts tax with a corporate income tax that would treat businesses and working households more fairly. While the state constitution prohibits establishment of a personal income tax, it also explicitly allows a business and/or corporate income tax.
But replacing the commerce tax with a business income tax would require at least a few Republicans to vote for it, because of the  state’s daftly undemocratic requirement that any new or increased taxes must be approved by two-thirds of both houses of the Legislature.
And approving a business income tax — or any new or increased tax for that matter — would require Democrats to not only vote for it, but to make a public case for it.
That’s just not going to happen at any time in the foreseeable future, if ever.
Instead, O’Neill’s bill to make the commerce tax slightly more complicated and slightly less useful was passed out of a committee controlled by Democrats, and seems exactly the sort of thing that perhaps not most but enough legislative Democrats would vote to send to the desk of a Republican governor who would no doubt be delighted to sign it, Nevada legislative Democrats arguably being among the most business-compliant legislative Democrats in the nation.
If that’s what happens, a little bit more of the state’s tax burden will be lifted from business, a  little bit more of it will fall on the shoulders of working households, and Nevada’s tax structure will be a little bit more upside down, fairness wise. In other words, yet again, the Nevada way will win the day.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250115_StateofState_Current-1418-2-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-18 12:24:51.264178

(Courtesy of the Nebraska Supreme Court)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court sided with the Legislature on Friday, upholding its constitutional authority to pass new parole eligibility standards as part of a major criminal justice reform law in 2023 meant to help address prison crowding.
In an unsigned 37-page ruling, the high court unanimously overturned a Lancaster County District Court ruling that parts of Legislative Bill 50 from 2023 were unconstitutional. The sections deal with parole eligibility and legislative intent that the expanded provisions apply to all committed offenders. 
Those laws took effect Sept. 2, 2023, but on the advice of Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services refused to implement the parole provisions. The lower court sided with Hilgers in March 2024, leading to the appeal.
“Whether applied prospectively or retroactively, LB 50’s new parole eligibility provisions do not result in substituting a milder punishment for the sentence originally imposed,” the Supreme Court wrote.

The justices reasoned that parole is not the same as commutation, or imposing a “milder” sentence, which is a power reserved exclusively to the Nebraska Board of Pardons and the executive branch.
The court said parole “merely changes the circumstances under which the sentence is being served.”
While some offenders might get earlier parole, the justices said, it can’t be assumed that everyone who will become eligible will then be granted parole sooner than they would have if not for LB 50’s passage. It passed the Legislature in a 34-15 vote in June 2023.
“Because leaving an erroneous declaration of unconstitutionality uncorrected would result in damage to the integrity, reputation or fairness of the judicial process, we must reverse the judgment for plain error,” the justices said.
Justice Jason Bergevin had not yet joined the Supreme Court when oral arguments came up in January, so Chief Judge Francie Riedmann of the Nebraska Court of Appeals filled in.
Expanded parole eligibility
Hilgers and his office specifically targeted Sections 47 and 48 of LB 50, which the Legislature in Section 57 explicitly said it intended to apply retroactively.
The new law extended parole eligibility in the following ways:

For someone serving a maximum term of 20 years or less, two years prior to a person’s mandatory discharge date.


For someone serving a maximum term of more than 20 years, when the person has served 80% of the time until the sentence’s mandatory discharge date.

LB 50 also created the possibility of “geriatric parole” for someone who is at least 75 years old and who has served at least 15 years of the sentence. Persons serving a Class I, IA or IB felony or for a sex-related offense are ineligible, as are those serving life imprisonment.
As a condition of geriatric parole, the person would need to wear an electronic monitoring device for at least 17 months.
In late 2023 court filings, the Corrections Department said the “retroactive effect” of LB 50 would impact 1,794 current offenders:

529 committed offenders who were already parole eligible would have had a new, earlier parole eligibility date.


345 committed offenders who were not yet parole eligible under the previous law would now be parole eligible.


920 committed offenders who had not yet reached parole eligibility would have a new, earlier parole eligibility date.

‘Holding out hope’
At least five serving on the Supreme Court would have needed to agree to declare part or all of LB 50 unconstitutional. Statutes are presumed to be constitutional and “all reasonable doubts are resolved in favor of its constitutionality.”
“The burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute is on the one attacking its validity,” the court wrote. “It is not the province of a court to annul a legislative act unless it clearly contravenes the constitution and no other resort remains.”
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, a longtime member of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, joined former State Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha, the then-committee chair, to get LB 50 over the finish line. 
McKinney said he was a little surprised by Friday’s decision but felt good. He said he had received numerous calls and questions from individuals and families who will be impacted by LB 50.
“I feel happy, but I feel relief for those individuals who were holding out hope that the court would uphold what we passed,” McKinney told the Nebraska Examiner.

The Judiciary Committee in 2023 was split 4-4 between Republicans and Democrats, and LB 50 advanced 4-2 after a temporary vacancy caused by the resignation of former State Sen. Suzanne Geist of Lincoln, a Republican, making four members a majority. Geist is now chief of staff and chief policy adviser to Hilgers. Geist’s legislative successor, State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, now chairs the Judiciary Committee. Bosn was unavailable for comment Friday.
AG’s opinions are not law
When Hilgers’ office filed the case in late 2023, he did so under a previous law since repealed by the Legislature. It required his office to challenge the constitutionality of a law if, on the AG’s written advice, an agency refused to implement a state law. However, justices during January arguments said this was the first time the lawsuit had followed “informal” advice rather than an archived AG’s opinion.
Secretary of State Bob Evnen defended the law against the attorney general, as was his duty under the previous law. Spokespersons for Evnen and Hilgers did not immediately respond to Friday requests for comment, nor did the Corrections Department.
Friday’s ruling almost did not happen on technical grounds after the attorney for Evnen contained no “assignment of error section” in a brief to the high court, only headings alluding to alleged errors, the opinion states. However, the case was allowed to move forward to determine whether there was a “plain error” in the lower court ruling, leading to Friday’s ruling.

This isn’t the first time Hilgers has questioned the constitutionality of state laws at the request of state agency heads, He did so notably in August 2023 after the Corrections Department and the Department of Health and Human Services questioned legislative oversight of child welfare and corrections and in July 2024, when Evnen questioned restoring voting rights to formerly convicted felons after the completion of their sentences, rather than a two-year waiting period that Evnen also questioned.
Wayne, with McKinney’s support, led the voting rights law. The Supreme Court ruled against Hilgers in October. No lawsuit was ever launched in the oversight case. Legislation is pending to get around a legal fight.
McKinney said he and others often have to remind colleagues that AG’s opinions lack the force of law and that Friday’s decision upheld that state lawmakers were “working to do the right thing” and “crossing our t’s and dotting our i’s.”
“Just because another agency or individual wants to try to say, ‘No, y’all can’t do that,’ I think it shows that there’s power in the Legislature to do good things,” McKinney said. “When you do good things for the right reasons, things will be upheld.”
This is a developing story.

In April of 2018, the complaint says, an MGM customer wrote in an email to a corporate host that his casino hosts may be sharing information about him with Bowyer, including an allegation that “Mr. Bowyer is attempting to steal clients from the MGM, hence he is in the illegal bookmaking business and [casino host] is funneling MGM sportsbook clients to Mr. Bowyer.” The email was forwarded to two casino marketing managers, the GCB complaint states, however it was not reported to MGM Compliance executives. 
The revelation comes a year and a half after federal authorities from California agreed to allow MGM to pay a $7.45 million fine in lieu of prosecution for allowing another illegal bookmaker, Wayne Nix, to gamble and launder cash at MGM Grand and the Cosmopolitan, which the company now owns. 
Then-MGM Grand president Scott Sibella “approved complimentary rooms, food service, and event tickets for Mr. Nix, and invited Mr. Nix on marketing trips to encourage him to gamble at the MGM Grand,” the complaint says. 
The Nevada Gaming Commission will be asked next week to sign off on a stipulated agreement calling for MGM Resorts International to pay an $8.5 million fine for allowing illegal bookmakers to gamble and failing to adhere to anti-money laundering laws. 
The Current was first to report in 2023 that the Criminal Division of the Internal Revenue Service was investigating MGM and Resorts World. The Nevada Gaming Commission last month approved a stipulated agreement in which Resorts World agreed to pay a $10.5 million fine. Federal authorities have yet to take any action against Resorts World.  
Former MGM Resorts Chairman and CEO Jim Murren, who led the company during the time the alleged violations occurred, declined to comment. Earlier this year, Resorts World named Murren to head up its Board of Directors. 
The Current reported last year that Murren, the company’s general counsel John McManus, and the GCB were notified in 2019 that executives, including Sibella, were catering to gamblers with questionable bankrolls.
GCB officials have declined to say what, if any, action they took at the time. Las Vegas Raiders president Sandra Douglass Morgan, who served as chairperson of the GCB at the time, also did not respond. 
Nix gambled at MGM properties on 400 separate days, the GCB complaint asserts. Each day constitutes a separate violation. 
A Cosmopolitan host “went to dinner with Mr. Nix, invited Mr. Nix to casino-sponsored events, and encouraged Mr. Nix to travel and stay at the Cosmopolitan to use the illegal proceeds,” and referred at least one casino customer to place illegal sports bets with Nix.
The GCB’s “months long investigation” revealed MGM executives had “suspicions” from March 2015 until September 2018 about Bowyer’s source of funds, but did nothing to stop him from gambling on 300 separate days at MGM properties.  
MGM knew, or should have known, since April 2018 that Bowyer was involved in illegal bookmaking, the complaint alleges. 
The Current was first to report in November 2023 that federal authorities raided Bowyer’s California home a month earlier and seized his phone. He has since pleaded guilty to money laundering and illegal bookmaking.

(Photo: Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez held his mother in a tight embrace and wept following his release from the Leon County Jail Thursday evening, where the U.S. citizen was held after his arrest for illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien.”
An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.

The pair didn’t reunite until the evening, after Lopez-Gomez’s first court appearance earlier in the day. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans ruled Thursday morning that she lacked jurisdiction to release him because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him for 48 hours.
After Riggans’ inspection of his Social Security card and birth certificate, which an advocate waved in the courtroom, the judge said she found no probable cause for the charge.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
The arrest record the trooper filed states that Lopez-Gomez had said he was in the country illegally but that he had handed over his ID. There was no mention of the Social Security card on the arrest report. However, Lopez-Gomez told the Phoenix he had shown the trooper a copy of his Social Security card and Georgia state ID.
The HSI agent who took Lopez-Gomez to Wendy’s directed questions to a spokesperson, who didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment or questions as of this publication.
After the reunion with his mom, Lopez-Gomez returned to the parking lot of the jail, where 30 protesters had been demanding his release. They met him with cheers and hugs.
Lopez-Gomez will have to return to the Leon County Courthouse on May 6. He was charged under a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention.
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also made their first appearances on the same charge on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

(Photo courtesy of the Oregon Department of Transportation/Flickr)Fred Cuozzo barely made it out of the South Obenchain Fire that burned through his home, barn, pumphouse and garage in Eagle Point, north of Medford, on Sept. 8, 2020.
Three years later, PacifiCorp — owner of Oregon private utility Pacific Power — was found by a jury to have been reckless and negligent in causing that fire and three others. In January 2024, a jury ordered the utility company to pay millions in damages to Cuozzo and nine other survivors, among the first group in an ongoing class action lawsuit.
Cuozzo still has not seen that settlement money because PacifiCorp is appealing the jury’s verdict. In three months, Cuozzo turns 80. He fears he might not in his lifetime see that money — money he needs to rebuild.
“I’ve been waiting almost five years since my home, contents and four other structures burned up,” he said. “I think they’re just waiting, trying to wait people out, and they can get tired of waiting or die, right?”
The Oregon Legislature is considering a bill that would do something about that, and it’s moving through the session with bipartisan support and little fanfare.
Senate Bill 926, sponsored by state Sen. David Brock Smith, R-Port Orford, and co-sponsored by Democratic state Sens. Jeff Golden of Ashland and James Manning of Eugene, would impose some consequences on PacifiCorp, and the state’s two other investor-owned utilities, for delaying settlements and prolonging litigation if they are found to have recklessly or negligently caused a wildfire.
On April 8, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s four Democrats voted to pass it out of the committee and onto the Senate floor, recommending they also vote yes. The committee’s two Republicans opposed the bill. The larger Senate vote has not yet been scheduled.
Golden said he only recently learned about the bill and signed on as a sponsor.
“I am interested in faster settlements. I’m not interested in rate increases or favorable treatment (for utilities) until people who have been waiting for a remedy get it,” he said.
Unlike other bills this session related to private utilities and wildfire risk that have been more controversial — including bills to shield utilities from some financial liabilities, and one bill that would have prohibited utilities from raising rates if they had ongoing wildfire suits — Senate Bill 926 appears to be meeting little friction. Only one person spoke at its first public hearing in March: a father of three in Albany who supports the bill and expressed frustration over his rising electricity costs. Brock Smith, the bill’s chief sponsor, did not give testimony during the bill’s first hearing or in the run-up to the judiciary committee’s vote. He also didn’t respond to calls, emails or texts about the bill.
Utility companies oppose the bill. Portland General Electric lobbyist Greg Alderson called it “problematically broad” in a letter submitted to the committee two days after the hearing.
PacifiCorp spokesman Simon Gutierrez, said in an email to the Capital Chronicle on Tuesday that the company strongly opposes the bill, though it has not yet submitted any formal testimony against it.
The bill was amended after public comment closed, unfairly and fundamentally altering the original bill without the opportunity to weigh in on the changes, both utilities contend.
 Imposing consequences

Senate Bill 926 would prohibit Oregon’s private investor-owned utilities from recovering wildfire lawsuit costs from ratepayers — including fines, fees and settlements — if the company was found by a court or jury to have acted recklessly or negligently in causing the fire. It would also prohibit companies from raising rates to pay for repairing or replacing wildfire-damaged infrastructure if the company is found by court or jury to have been at fault for the fire.
Electric utilities indebted by a wildfire judgment would not be allowed to send dividends, income, interest or profits to corporate owners and shareholders and would pay 9% interest on any damages awarded to wildfire victims starting from the date of the fire, rather than the date the damages are awarded.
The bill would apply retroactively to all powerline-ignited wildfires since Jan. 1, 2020. For a company like PacifiCorp, that could mean millions in interest on cases that have been awaiting trial for years, and limits to the utilities’ now annual requests to raise rates.
“It is astounding that Senate leadership in the Oregon legislature is seeking to insert themselves into ongoing litigation involving PacifiCorp by retroactively imposing costs in the millions under a scheme that would apply to no other business in the state,” Gutierrez said.
He added that in light of a recent report from the Oregon Department of Forestry that concluded PacifiCorp did not start fires it was previously found to have started in the Santiam Canyon, the bill should be reconsidered.
That state report refutes statements from first responders from the U.S. Forest Service and months of trial testimony about the origins of the fires, and is unlikely to be admissible in PacifiCorp’s appeal because the company in 2023 moved to exclude all government reports at trial.

(Screenshots via YouTube)Social media posts have been falsely claiming that a man with connections to Arizona and far-right militias was the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who smashed a car’s window with an axe to apprehend a Guatemalan immigrant. But that man has not been hired by ICE and is currently in Oklahoma spreading conspiracy theories there.
Michael “Lewis Arthur” Meyer is the founder of a group known as Veterans on Patrol which has been involved with a number of militia activities along the southern border often with a QAnon theme.
Users on BlueSky and X, formerly Twitter, have been claiming that Meyer is an ICE agent who was seen breaking the window of a vehicle to arrest a Guatemalan immigrant woman as she was waiting for her attorney.
The Arizona Mirror found that Meyer was posting videos of himself in Oklahoma at the time of the incident in Massachusetts. Meyer has been making videos of himself at the Oklahoma state Capitol telling staff of lawmakers that he intends to “destroy” what he claims is “military weather manipulation” technology.
In an email to the Mirror, Meyer confirmed that he has been living in Oklahoma and said he does not work for ICE.
And ICE “vehemently” denied the claims that Meyer works for the agency in any capacity.
“The officer recorded making an arrest in New Bedford, Mass. is not militia leader Lewis Arthur,” an ICE spokesman said in an emailed statement to the Mirror. “The rumors circulating on social media that ICE Boston employed a militia leader from Arizona to make arrests in New England are not only false, but they are also inflammatory and place the safety of federal officers in jeopardy.”
ICE would not release the name of the officer seen in the video, and would only confirm that “he is a federal law enforcement officer who has worked with ICE to help keep New England communities safe for years.”
Meyer believes in the debunked chemtrail conspiracy theory that has been overtaking many state legislatures. His Telegram, a social media channel favored by the far-right for allowing hate speech and graphic content, if full of conspiratorial creeds and allusions to violence towards the alleged weather manipulation technology in Oklahoma.
Meyer’s group has long engaged in these sorts of antics and “operations.”
In 2018, his group found a homeless encampment and began spreading unfounded claims of sex trafficking and last year claimed that Hurricane Helene was created by the United States military.
Meyer also has a criminal record which includes damaging and stealing water meant for migrants along the border left by humanitarian groups in Arizona, disorderly conduct and trespassing at a cement factory he believed was part of a QAnon-style conspiracy.
Journalist Jessica Pishko also confirmed on X that she had recently seen Meyer in Oklahoma.

Gruters has been a candidate for CFO since last June – months after Trump publicly urged him to run for the seat, saying on his Truth Social page, “Joe was on the ‘Trump Train’ before it even left the station and, if he decides to run, he will have my Complete and Total Endorsement.”
The Florida Chief Financial Officer seat remains vacant, weeks after Jimmy Patronis resigned before his election to Congress on April 1. Although Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he would select an interim CFO before choosing a successor to fill out the remaining year-and-half term, he has yet to do so.
Gruters will most likely not be that pick. He and DeSantis have never been close, and they clashed a year ago regarding Amendment 3, the proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis in Florida.

This week: State employees begin union contract negotiations; Minnesota posts strong job numbers despite economic uncertainty; union carpenters protest subcontractor Absolute Drywall; and whistleblower alleges serious data breach at National Labor Relations Board. 
State employees begin union contract negotiations
Negotiations kicked off this week between the state of Minnesota and tens of thousands of its unionized workers in what may shape up to be the most contentious round of contract talks in recent memory.
Members of the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees, which represents about 18,000 workers, continue to hold protests against Gov. Tim Walz’s order for most workers to return to the office 50% of the time beginning on June 1. The union has called for a full repeal of the rule and raised the prospect of a strike, though the soonest one could happen wouldn’t be until late in the summer.
The union says the flexibility and autonomy that comes with remote work has been a boon for recruitment and retention, while forcing workers back into the office will increase their costs and steal time away from their families.
In their opening offer, MAPE leaders proposed that their members have the right to work remotely unless the state can “clearly and convincingly demonstrate that essential job functions of the position cannot be completed when telecommuting.” The proposal would also have the state reimburse workers for parking expenses if they are mandated to be onsite on an incidental basis.
Walz said this week he has no plans to rescind or delay the return-to-office order, and brushed aside concerns that there wouldn’t be enough office space to accommodate workers after agencies began downsizing during the pandemic.
“I understand that there are disruptions for folks. But the ability to come back to work, work in there together 50% of the time is right in line with the majority, the vast majority of every other state government and most of our private employers,” Walz said at a news conference highlighting potential federal cuts to Medicaid.
Rules on layoffs will also be a key sticking point for the two sides, as the state stares down the likelihood of large federal funding cuts on top of a gloomy budget forecast for the near future. Minnesota Management and Budget, which is negotiating with the union, proposed creating “emergency layoffs” to be used in the event of “fiscal exigencies,” as well as epidemics, natural disasters and national security emergencies.
The new kind of layoff would allow the state to idle workers without having to follow the usual contractual procedures governing layoffs, like placing laid off workers in vacant positions at the same seniority level.
“We are deeply concerned about this proposal, especially given the timing. Workers are already being laid off across multiple agencies. Removing their only remaining protections in a moment of instability is unnecessary and harmful,” MAPE President Megan Dayton told the Reformer.
On Monday, the Minnesota Department of Health announced it was delaying layoffs for approximately 170 employees because a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing $11 billion in federal health grants, including about $220 million for Minnesota.
In an internal memo obtained by the Star Tribune, assistant Commissioner Mel Gresczyk also acknowledged the agency made errors in determining layoffs, discovering some employees who received notices were funded by other grants and revenue sources. The Department of Health plans to issue new layoff notices, which will take effect May 14.
In its opening bid, the union also proposed tying cost-of-living raises to inflation and adding protections from job losses from artificial intelligence.
Job growth remains strong in Minnesota
Minnesota added 10,700 jobs in March, the biggest monthly gain in a year, despite massive upheavals in the global economy driven by the Trump administration’s trade war.
“The recent on again, off again round of tariffs continues to cause significant uncertainty among Minnesota companies … but even so, I have to say Minnesota’s job market has so far shown impressive resilience,” said Matt Varilek, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, at a news briefing on Thursday.
Minnesota gained 37,581 jobs over the year, faster than the national rate of growth. Unemployment ticked up slightly, but it was driven by more people entering the workforce, with the labor force participation rate increasing to 68.2%, among the tops in the nation.
Trouble may be on the horizon, however, as businesses that rely on products from other countries stare down steep tariffs and a souring consumer sentiment that’s likely to lead to a pullback in spending and layoffs. Tourist-dependent industries may also take a hit this season as international workers and customers stay away, either in protest of the Trump administration or fear of being caught up in immigration enforcement.
Trump’s efforts to slash the size of the federal workforce through layoffs and buyouts have also not yet appeared in the jobs data, since the mass firings of probationary workers has been tied up in court and those who accepted voluntary buyouts may remain on the government’s payroll through September. More layoffs are planned, affecting Minnesota’s roughly 18,000 federal workers, with agency heads required to submit plans for massive staffing reductions by Monday.
Jobs in state and local government, meanwhile, saw strong growth and added 1,500 jobs over the month in March.
Carpenters union protests Absolute Drywall

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)
Members of the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters picketed outside an affordable housing development in Burnsville on Wednesday to protest Absolute Drywall, a subcontractor on the site with a long history of labor violations.
The demonstration was part of coordinated protests across the country by the carpenters union called Tax Fraud Days of Action aimed at shaming contractors the union says drive down industry wages by skirting labor laws.
Absolute Drywall has been cited repeatedly for various labor law violations, including illegally employing minors and misclassifying workers as independent contractors to avoid paying overtime, health insurance and payroll taxes. Minnesota loses upwards of $136 million a year in tax revenue because of payroll tax fraud, according to an estimate by the Midwest Economic Policy Institute.
The company is currently being sued by the state Department of Human Rights for sex discrimination for firing a female worker who was raped by a co-worker on a job site. The company is also being investigated by state labor regulators for alleged wage theft on an apartment complex built by the owners of the Minnesota Vikings.
The carpenters union also criticized MWF Properties — the developer of the Pillsbury Ridge development they picketed — and its general contractor, Eagle Building Company, for continuing to hire Absolute Drywall even after its checkered past has become public.
Eagle Building Company told the Reformer the company does not condone the behavior laid out in the allegations against Absolute Drywall and would reevaluate its business relationship with the subcontractor after the legal process played out.
“We have a rigorous program in place to identify and prevent worker abuses on our job sites,” Nick Williams, vice president at Eagle, wrote in an email.
MWF Properties did not respond to a request for comment.
Whistleblower warns of DOGE intrusion into private NLRB data
Members of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative appear to have taken reams of sensitive data from the National Labor Relations Board, according to a whistleblower’s account detailed by NPR.
The intrusion into the agency, which investigates and adjudicates unfair labor practices, has alarmed labor experts, who say it could expose personal information about union members, proprietary corporate data and witness testimony — data protected by the Privacy Act and other federal laws.
“It could result in damage to individual workers, to union-organizing campaigns and to unions themselves,” Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, told NPR.
DOGE’s effective leader, world’s richest man Elon Musk, owns companies with a number of cases before the NLRB, including alleged illegal firings of SpaceX employees. Lawyers for SpaceX have argued the NLRB’s structure is unconstitutional in that case.
In a report sent to Congress, NLRB information technology employee Daniel Berulis detailed how DOGE engineers were granted virtually unrestricted access to the agency’s computer system. Then they took steps to conceal their digital footprints across the system and appear to have exported gigabytes of data.
Berulis also noticed attempted logins from an IP address in Russia after DOGE accessed the system.
“If he didn’t know the backstory, any [chief information security officer] worth his salt would look at network activity like this and assume it’s a nation-state attack from China or Russia,” said Jake Braun, a former White House cyber official.
After Berulis raised concerns about the data intrusion, he found a printed letter taped to his door which included threatening language and a picture of him walking his dog.
The NLRB’s acting press secretary denies that DOGE was granted access to its systems. NPR reports that a day after its investigation was published, DOGE assigned two of its people to work part-time, remotely at the agency.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/487509966_1072026698298301_3793242531339463052_n-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-04-18 11:03:16.031178

Chris Van Hollen met Thursday with the wrongly deported Maryland resident, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who’s been held for more than a month at a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.The meeting came at the end of Van Hollen’s second day in the country, where he faced difficulties securing an in-person meeting or phone call with the Salvadoran citizen. The Maryland Democrat traveled to the Central American country this week to help bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States or at least see how he was doing. “I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar,” Van Hollen wrote in a social media post late Thursday, where he shared a picture of his meeting with Abrego Garcia, who appeared in civilian clothes.“Tonight I had that chance. I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love,” Van Hollen said, adding that he would provide a full update upon his return to the United States.Abrego Garcia has been housed at the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT. The Trump administration has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error.”El Salvador President Nayib Bukele appeared to mock the meeting between Van Hollen and Abrego Garcia on social media, saying: “Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody.”",,,,2025-04-18 11:03:16.031178

Angus King (I-ME) speaks during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the conclusion of military operations in Afghanistan and plans for future counterterrorism operations on Capitol Hill on September 28, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Patrick Semansky-Pool/Getty Images)On April 18, 1775, Paul Revere famously rode through the streets of Massachusetts to warn residents about the approach of British troops, which culminated in the Battle of Lexington and Concord that kicked off America’s war for independence. 
Now, 250 years later, Sen. Angus King is giving his own warning over what he sees as the imminent collapse of American democracy under President Donald Trump. 
In an interview with writer, historian and Lincoln County resident Heather Cox Richardson, Maine’s independent senator discussed why this inflection point in American history is so resonant today.
“I believe we are in one of the most dangerous places our country has been in since the founding, because what is happening before our eyes is the collapse of the constitutional structure that the framers designed to protect us from the inevitable abuse that comes from the concentration of power,” King said, explaining that the U.S. Constitution purposefully divided power up between the Legislature — or Congress — the President and the courts. 
“But here’s what’s happening right now,” he said, “is that the executive branch is seizing more and more power.” 
He said “there are two levels of things going on here: one is bad and the other is dangerous. There are bad things like what [the Department of Government Efficiency] is doing and messing around with Social Security and this sending people to El Salvador. That’s really bad, but what’s dangerous is the way it’s being done, by essentially violating the plain intent of the Constitution, by having the President be the legislator and the executive at the same time, that’s a recipe for the loss of our freedom.”
And for people who are “cheering on his agenda” and saying, “Well, we don’t care that he’s doing all this unconstitutional stuff,” King said, “They’re going to care because eventually the Eye of Sauron is going to turn on them,” referencing the evil, all-powerful symbol in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings.”
And while the courts are “doing pretty well so far” in pushing back, King repeatedly expressed alarm over what he sees as Congress’ abdication of its duty and the complicity of his Republican colleagues.
“What we have is a test between institutional loyalty, constitutional loyalty, and party loyalty. And so my Republican colleagues — who I’m doing everything I can to sort of peel off to say, ‘Enough is enough’ — so far, haven’t been willing to take that step,” he said. “They’re in control of the Senate, they’re in control of the House, and they’re looking at getting their tax bill through and getting their budget bill through, rather than what’s happening to the structure of our government in the process.”
He also said that he believes many Republicans are not speaking up because of Trump’s threat to challenge dissenters in upcoming elections by running primary opponents financed by billionaire advisor Elon Musk.
King also spoke about the frustration among voters, acknowledging the most frequent question he hears is, “I’m mad as hell. What can I do?’”
“They can get together, they can talk to each other, they can reach out to their neighbors,” King said. “They can participate in peaceful demonstrations that indicate to people like me that people want change, that they’re concerned…They also can communicate to our offices.”
He said American people actually have a lot of power and that members of Congress are influenced when they hear stories from constituents about how Trump’s actions are having a real negative impact on their lives — such as someone whose Social Security check didn’t come or a veteran unable to get a medical appointment.
“Believe it or not, anecdotes matter,” King said, “and so when people are in touch with us, if they are specific about what’s going on and what’s affecting them in their real life, that’s the kind of thing that breaks through with members of Congress — that their constituents are being hurt — and that’s one of the reasons I think we may see some progress on this over the next two or three weeks, because the damage that’s being done is just starting to manifest itself out in the communities.”
But, King acknowledged, he is “an optimist.”
As for Paul Revere, Maine is celebrating his midnight ride with a series of events that will feature the lighting of lanterns and lighthouses throughout the state. Organized by the Maine Semiquincentennial Commission, several of the ceremonies will include the reading of the famous 1861 poem by Portland native Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, “Paul Revere’s Ride,” which concludes:

So through the night rode Paul Revere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm,—
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.

They warned of budget problems if the Legislature continued to expend more money than collected in revenue. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A bullish revenue picture for state government in Kansas through the current and next fiscal years couldn’t sugarcoat projections the state budget could end up with a $730 million deficit by 2029 if lawmakers continued spending more than what was collected in revenue.
The new forecast released Thursday by the Consensus Revenue Group, which is responsible for updating financial reports twice each year, indicated the treasury could expect to collect $157 million more in the current fiscal year than projected in November. In addition, the state could receive $219 million more in the 2026 fiscal year than predicted six months ago. The state general fund takes in about $10 billion annually.
The estimating group said the state’s budget ending balance could sit at $2.29 billion at close of the current fiscal year in June, but fall to $1.73 billion in 2026, $903 million in 2027 and $63 million in 2028 before going under water by $730 million in 2029.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said the latest revenue estimates from university economists and state financial experts could be viewed as positive news.
“In reality, they underscore the seriousness of the financial predicament ahead,” Kelly said. “The bizarre and irresponsible budget gimmicks used by the Republican-led Legislature spend more than the state takes in by nearly $800 million per year. Ultimately, this will lead to a historically large budget deficit.”
She said the revenue update came one week after GOP House and Senate leaders adjourned the annual legislative session. Traditionally, the Legislature remained in session until the revenue forecast was updated so spending and tax policy could be refined.
“Kansans need to demand their legislators restore fiscal sanity and fairness when they return in January,” Kelly said.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Republican from Wichita, said the Legislature successfully assumed a more direct approach to developing the new state budget and produced a plan that spent less than recommended by the governor.
He said the Legislature was confident in the wisdom of the three-year, $1.2 billion income tax cut adopted in the 2024 special session and the additional tax relief approved in the 2025 regular session.
“Be wary of those who want to make political hay by invoking the budget boogeyman and screaming that the sky is falling,” Hawkins said. “These positive consensus revenue estimates reaffirm we’re headed down a smart and sustainable path as we continue to monitor all fiscal data as it’s available.”
 
A structural imbalance
Adam Proffitt, secretary of the Kansas Department of administration and budget director for the governor, state tax reductions and elevated spending were significant drivers of the state’s financial prospectus.
He said the extended assessment was that state revenue could remain below expenditures during the next four years unless a different approach was taken by state lawmakers.
“We need to get more structurally balanced,” Proffitt said. “This is something we’ve been watching for a couple years. I think the governor’s been pretty consistent in her message that we need to be showing fiscal restraint and making sure we have a good handle on expenditures and don’t grow them unnecessarily.”
Proffitt said the projected $800 million decline in state budget ending balances in fiscal years 2027, 2028 and 2029 would leave the state in dire financial condition. An unknown for forecasters, for a couple more months after close of tax season, was the influence of retroactive income tax cuts approved by the state lawmakers in 2024, he said. In addition, he said, the forecast changes didn’t take into account the influence of tax bills on Kelly’s desk nor possible federal policy shifts.
Shirley Morrow, director of the nonpartisan Kansas Legislative Research Department, said during a news conference at the Capitol the solution to the state’s future budget predicament was obvious.
“To me,” she said, “the simple answer — and this is going to be too simple — is increase revenue and decrease expenditures.”
Morrow said forces that could influence the state’s bottom line were tied to volatility in the U.S. economy. Factors capable of altering the fiscal assessment included persistently elevated inflation, trade policy changes relevant to agriculture exports and aviation manufacturing, shifting unemployment rates, sustained high interest rates, cuts in federal funding to states, monetary policy and geopolitical dynamics, she said.
“The reoccurring theme throughout the forecast cycle is an increased volatility in the state’s economy,” Morrow said.
She said the Kansas inflation rate in 2025 was raised from 2.3% to 2.9% while the estimate for inflation in 2026 was raised from 2.2% to 2.5%. Kansas has added 3,300 jobs over the year, she said.
In terms of agriculture, she said, crop producers continued to struggle with low commodity prices and high input costs. Livestock producers were looking to expand beef herds based on continued escalation in market prices, she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Proffitt-and-Morrow-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 11:03:16.031178

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A coalition of businesses and the state’s biggest police union are sparring over a New Jersey law meant to protect prosecutors, judges, and cops by shielding their home addresses and phone numbers from disclosure.
Businesses that use data for things like real estate, lending, fraud detection, background checks, and credit reporting say changes legislators made in 2023 to strengthen the law instead allowed data privacy companies to profit by suing and seeking damages from companies that don’t remove personal information from the internet. The businesses recently formed the Public Safety Information Protection Coalition to fight the state statute, known as Daniel’s Law.
The businesses asked a federal judge last June to declare Daniel’s Law an unconstitutional, impermissibly broad violation of the First Amendment. The judge rejected that challenge, and last month the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to review the judge’s ruling.
John Molinelli, a former Bergen County prosecutor, is the coalition’s spokesman.
“Daniel’s Law serves a noble purpose, but the law is broken,” Molinelli said in a statement last week.
The New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association wrote an open letter Wednesday to Molinelli, accusing him of falling prey to “the data industry’s latest ploy to avoid accountability for putting public servants in harm’s way.” The letter, signed by state PBA President Peter Andreyev and 43 leaders of other PBA chapters statewide, said members of the data business coalition “pretend to be advocates for Daniel’s Law while secretly seeking to undermine and weaken it.”
“They would rather spend millions of dollars spreading misinformation and lies than simply comply with a law meant to keep us and our families safe,” the letter says.
New Jersey enacted Daniel’s Law in 2020. It’s named after federal Judge Esther Salas’ son, Daniel Anderl, who was slain at the judge’s home that year by a gunman who wanted to harm Salas. Since state legislators passed the law soon after Anderl’s death, they have expanded it several times to protect additional public workers, including child welfare investigators.
Lawmakers amended it in 2023 to establish mandatory monetary damages for violations, among other things. The following year, Atlas Data Privacy Corp. filed 118 class-action lawsuits on behalf of law enforcement officers against data brokers accused of ignoring requests to remove the officers’ data from various websites.
Molinelli had called such lawsuits predatory, accusing Atlas of “engineering” the 2023 legislative amendments so that it could sue violators and reap the profits.
The PBA officials defended the lawsuits, saying the data brokers and businesses Molinelli represents continue to violate Daniel’s Law by selling law enforcement officers’ private information despite the ongoing litigation and officers’ pleas to them to stop.
“What you call ‘predatory lawsuits’ we call a fight to protect ourselves and our families from predators who seek to cause us harm,” the PBA officials wrote.
PBA officials have cited a leaked conference call, first reported by Politico earlier this month, during which data brokers and industry groups plotted how to weaken the law.
Molinelli, in a statement from a spokesman, said the PBA’s letter fails to address how best to protect public officials who do not want their personal information published.
“Many of those who signed this letter are friends of mine and I respect them greatly for what they do. Their misplaced efforts to attack me for wanting Daniel’s Law to work as intended are regrettably shrouded by the financial plans of Atlas Data Privacy Corporation,” he said.
Daniel’s Law has inspired similar legislation in other states, even though it has prompted several legal challenges here.
Still, legislators aim to expand it further.
One bill now in the Statehouse pipeline would extend privacy protections under Daniel’s Law to court administrators and deputy court administrators, while another would allow people protected under the law to use a post office box or address other than their home address on their driver’s license or other official identification cards.
Salas has recently said judges and their families have received unsolicited pizza deliveries from unknown persons — a signal, she says, that the people know where the judges live — and some of them are sent using her late son’s name.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)South Minneapolis along East Lake Street is a thriving immigrant neighborhood with block after block of family-run restaurants, churches and more businesses than you can shake a stick at, ordinarily serving a bustling foot traffic.  
As Sahan Journal reported not long after inauguration day, employees there are now scared to come to work. Customers are afraid to walk in the door. ICE raids and the threat of them frighten an entire populace witless, wreaking economic havoc.  
Undocumented immigrants already had to worry about being exploited by unscrupulous employers. 
In President Trump’s America, those who need protection are instead being targeted; the outrageous, mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador is just one example we know about. 
The U.S. Department of Justice, which not long ago prided itself on its independence, has now become a key lever in Trump’s effort to reverse the gains of the Civil Rights Movement. The first step was freezing the work of the Civil Rights Division, as the Washington Post first reported, “halting much of its investigative activity dating from the Biden administration and not pursuing new indictments, cases or settlements, according to a memo sent to the temporary head of the division.” 
That means stopping cases enforcing important civil rights statutes, like the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Here in Minnesota the changes are affecting federal oversight of the Minneapolis Police Department and its long history of unconstitutional policing, including off-the-charts levels of racial profiling as revealed in the 2023 DOJ report. 
What was catalogued in that report, former U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said, “made what happened to George Floyd possible.” After Floyd’s murder and days of ensuing carnage, it took nearly five years to put the federal police reform agreement in place. 
But Trump’s DOJ seems uncommitted to getting final approval. DOJ attorneys recently won a second 30-day stay on the pending consent decree case between Minneapolis and the federal government.
Trump’s right-wing pals are even pressuring him to pardon Derek Chauvin for his federal crimes. Thankfully, Trump can’t pardon the state murder charge. But still, expect all hell to break loose on Minneapolis streets should he issue the pardon for the federal civil rights charge.
Even if Trump holds off on the pardon, the prospects of a federal consent decree to oversee MPD aren’t great. The head of the once-proud DOJ Civil Rights Division is Harmeet Dhillon. As NBC News reported, Dhillon has “alleged fraud in the 2020 election, accused Google of discriminating against white men and spoken out against state laws to protect doctors who perform gender-affirming surgery for transgender minors.”
Luckily, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights already put its own agreement with the city of Minneapolis in place, but federal oversight would be good belt-and-suspenders insurance. 
Trump, who was once accused by the federal government of refusing to rent to Black tenants, issued an executive order “ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity,” which is double-talk, the effect of which is de facto legalized discrimination. 
“Federal civil-rights laws protect individual Americans from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, [protections supporting] equality of opportunity for all Americans. As President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced for the benefit of all Americans,” he wrote.  
He is, to be crass about it, taking a leak on our heads and calling it rain.
This gravely impacts women, racial and ethnic and religious minorities, lesbians and gays, not to mention the now frequently targeted transgender community. Everyone who isn’t a white heterosexual male and counts on established civil rights legislation is straight out of luck. The DOJ’s Civil Rights Division was created to protect citizens from the actions of bigots after the Civil War, enforcing the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution. They expanded that brief to protect other vulnerable folks. Now, contrary to Trump-speak, the DOJ is about the business of doing exactly the opposite.
A key area is the workplace, where women, Black and immigrant workers have made strides thanks to enforcement of anti-discrimination laws and, yes, diversity efforts by both the federal government and corporations. With Trump turning the clock back, Meta, Ford, McDonald’s, Walmart and Target all got in line. 
It took public outrage to restore recognition of the likes of the late Colin Powell, Jackie Robinson and other prominent Black veterans after Trump’s order to scrub government websites of “DEI,” i.e., Black achievement. 
Sadly, a prevailing reality is that some people of color like Justice Clarence Thomas — a disgrace to Thurgood Marshall’s legacy — will pull the ladder up after them. Where the clarion call once was “We shall overcome,” their credo is “I have overcome.” 
Erec Smith of the Koch-funded Cato Institute endorsed Trump’s sweeping edict, saying “the Trump administration isn’t getting rid of the concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion as they are typically understood. He’s getting rid of the critical social justice version, which is inherently divisive.”
A Trump executive order asserts, “The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination.” 
If you buy that, the proverbial bridge in Brooklyn is still available.

(Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)The Bible says pain and agony engulfed Jesus Christ in the final hours before his death, while fear of the future gripped his followers. 
Fear once again is prevalent in churches as Christians gather for Easter. This time it is because “roughly one in 12 Christians in the United States are vulnerable to deportation or live with a family member who could be deported.” 
That’s according to a new report, “One Part of the Body: The Potential Impact of Deportations on American Christian Families,” published by a coalition of Christian organizations.
“Many American Christians, we suspect, have not realized that among immigrants at risk of deportation, the vast majority — four out of five — are fellow Christians,” the report’s introductory letter said. 
Noem cheers court order requiring immigrants without legal status to register and carry documents

The report’s purpose “is to invite American Christians — within our congregations and within the halls of governmental power — to recognize that, if even a fraction of those vulnerable to deportation are actually deported, the ramifications are profound — for those individuals, of course, but also for their U.S.-citizen family members and, because when one part of the body suffers, every part suffers with it, for all Christians.”
Four South Dakotans with government power who could make a difference are U.S. Senators John Thune and Mike Rounds, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
Government action, or inaction as the case may be, is the source of great distress in churches today. 
“There is just a strong emphasis on fear,” among parishioners, said The Very Rev. Kristopher Cowles, vicar for Hispanic ministry in the Catholic Diocese of Sioux Falls. He also serves Our Lady of Guadalupe church in Sioux Falls. 
“They don’t know from day to day what is going to happen.”
Cowles is featured prominently in the report, which said that “80 percent of all of those at risk of deportation are Christians. Sixty-one percent of those at risk of deportation are Catholic, 13 percent are evangelical and 7 percent are adherents to other Christian traditions.”
The report notes that President Donald Trump said during his campaign there were as many as 20 million deportable immigrants present in the U.S. How many will be targeted for deportation is unknown. 
Noem, who said in a 2021 Newsmax interview that “our faith is everything — we love the Lord,” has been the tip of the spear in deporting immigrants.
The report quoted Cowles saying government policies often cause the problem. “So many of our laws make it nearly impossible to have a course forward even if they want to do so legally,” he said of immigrants. 
He wished there was more empathy among elected leaders. 
“I wish lawmakers would understand the sacrifices that so many people have gone through, and what so many of them are running from,” he said in the report. “Some are just looking for a better life and some are looking to just survive.”
Most people, the report said, want violent criminals and those with final orders of deportation to be the priority for immigration enforcement. But they don’t want blanket deportation. 
Reforming the immigration system must be a priority. Congress, which largely created this humanitarian problem, has the power to solve it.

Thune, Rounds and Johnson all say religion is central to their lives. 
Thune has said his faith in Christ is “the foundation for pretty much everything I do.” 
Rounds, in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, reflected on faith and his job. “I think part of it goes back to asking for wisdom and asking for the ability and the help to do what’s right, to make the right decisions. A lot of decisions are not black and white. It’s a matter of making the right decision long term. That saves lives. I think that’s something that all of us as Christians should be doing.”
Johnson has said “faith, family and freedom are pillars of our nation.”
Given their faith, and their powerful political positions and ability to influence this issue, they should not sit on the sidelines. It shouldn’t be that hard to sway Congress when 87% of voting members say they are Christians. 
Cowles reminded everyone that Jesus was an immigrant. “He made his way from Galilee and Judea into Egypt to flee the persecution of Herod.”
He pointed to the Catholic Church’s position on immigration. It says people have a right to migrate to sustain their lives and the lives of their families. It acknowledges that a country has a right to regulate its borders but that it should regulate them with “justice and mercy.”
“That is the issue we are running into right now,” he said.
Cowles added that Jesus “would stand with the immigrants because he understands the persecution of people.”
As Christians gather in churches this week and gaze at the image of Christ nailed to the cross, the authors of the “One Part of the Body” report have one wish.
“We hope that you will prayerfully ask the Lord what part you should play at a time when so many of your brothers and sisters are fearful of the impacts of deportation.”

An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.

The pair didn’t reunite until the evening, after Lopez-Gomez’s first court appearance earlier in the day. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans ruled Thursday morning that she lacked jurisdiction to release him because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him for 48 hours.
After Riggans’ inspection of his Social Security card and birth certificate, which an advocate waved in the courtroom, the judge said she found no probable cause for the charge.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
The arrest record the trooper filed states that Lopez-Gomez had said he was in the country illegally but that he had handed over his ID. There was no mention of the Social Security card on the arrest report. However, Lopez-Gomez told the Phoenix he had shown the trooper a copy of his Social Security card and Georgia state ID.
The HSI agent who took Lopez-Gomez to Wendy’s directed questions to a spokesperson, who didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment or questions as of this publication.
After the reunion with his mom, Lopez-Gomez returned to the parking lot of the jail, where 30 protesters had been demanding his release. They met him with cheers and hugs.
Lopez-Gomez will have to return to the Leon County Courthouse on May 6. He was charged under a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention.
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also made their first appearances on the same charge on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s voter-approved mandate for paid sick leave has not yet gone into effect, but some lawmakers are already trying to reduce the number of workers who would benefit from it.
A bill pending in the Alaska Legislature, House Bill 161, would exempt businesses with fewer than 50 employees, a change from the 15-employee threshold in the labor-rights initiative that voters approved in November. The bill would also drop seasonal workers from the mandate for accrued paid sick leave.The bill was introduced on March 28 by Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, with Rep. Julie Coulombe, R-Anchorage, as a co-sponsor. Both are members of the House minority. It has the support of a key majority member; House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, signed on as a co-sponsor on April 14.
It addresses Ballot Measure 1, a three-part citizen initiative that will raise Alaska’s minimum wage and protect workers against any employer-imposed political or religious meetings, as well as mandate paid sick leave, based on time accrued over work periods. Voters approved Ballot Measure 1 by a 58-42 percent margin. The new law is set to go into effect on July 1.
Ruffridge and Coulombe, during the bill’s first hearing on Wednesday, described the proposed changes as modifications that fit within the state constitution’s limits. While the constitution forbids sweeping changes within two years to any voter-passed initiatives, the bill “in no way seeks to repeal or change some of the key provisions of Ballot Measure 1,” chiefly the minimum-wage hike that was probably the most popular element, Ruffridge told the House Labor and Commerce Committee.
Coulombe said the changes amounted to a “few tweaks” that are necessary to help small businesses.
“What will happen if we don’t try to amend this a little bit, make the language a little cleaner and make it more adaptable to small businesses, we have small businesses that might actually just go out of business,” she told the committee.
The bill has the enthusiastic backing of the Alaska Chamber, a business group that campaigned against the ballot measure.
In testimony at Wednesday’s hearing of the House Labor and Commerce Committee, Kati Capozzi, the chamber’s president, called it a “vital correction” to a pending mandate that burdens small businesses, especially in the tourism and hospitality sectors.
“Maybe well-intentioned or maybe not, Ballot Measure 1 introduced a one-size-fits-all mandate that failed to account for Alaska’s unique economic landscape,” she said.
Echoing earlier comments by Ruffridge and Coulombe, Capozzi said voters were less aware of Ballot Measure 1’s sick-leave provisions than they were of the wage hike. “It’s become clear that many voters did not understand the true and full implications of the ballot measure,” she said.
One of the leaders of the Ballot Measure 1 campaign vowed to work against House Bill 161.
“For me, it’s really important that the voters will be respected here,” Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, said Thursday. “The voters have made this choice. The voters have said, ‘We would like this to happen.’ And whether or not the business groups can use a smaller group of people, the Alaska Legislature, to try to undo their will — that is something we will fight.”
Hall disputed the bill sponsors’ characterization of the changes as minor.
“This, in my mind, is a substantial change. It is repealing the benefit that the voters voted for,” she said.
She also disputed the contention that voters had not paid attention to the sick-leave provisions in the initiative.
“That is just silliness, because we were very clear that it was earned sick leave,” she said. “Almost all of our advertising was about that, so almost every single ad we put out was about somebody’s earned sick-leave benefit.”
She said she was expecting some pushback on the bill’s provisions, but not this soon.
“It’s a little bit shocking to me that it’s such an aggressive overreach of what the voters passed,” she said. “I’m not surprised that they’re going to fight us on this tooth and nail every single session, to try to claw it back. I’m a little surprised they’re starting before it’s even a law.”
Alaska was not the only state where voters in November approved a mandate for paid sick leave. Similar initiatives passed in Missouri and Nebraska.
Several other states already required paid sick leave prior to last year’s election.

It was supposed to be a trial that would be closely watched by California homelessness advocates, public defenders and legal experts. But instead, the case was thrown out by the judge — leaving some stakeholders wondering whether it makes sense to arrest homeless people at all.
As CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall explains, following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year granting local governments more authority to clear homeless encampments, cities across California have enacted more punitive policies banning public camping — including citing and arresting unhoused residents. 
But some attorneys and the unhoused residents they represent are eager to bring their cases before juries in order to demonstrate the shortcomings of enforcing camping bans and clear their names. That includes Wickey Two Hands, a 77-year-old homeless man who was poised to be the first person tried in court under Fresno’s anti-camping ban after police arrested him last year.
On April 10, however, a judge ended up dismissing all charges because the city waited too long to prosecute. 
The case’s conclusion underscores the considerable amount of time, labor and resources used — not only from the city and county, but also Two Hands’ lawyer, activists and local journalists — to enforce a policy that seeks to penalize public camping.

Ron Hochbaum, a law professor at the University of the Pacific: “When you think about all the people who were involved, from police to the city attorney’s office to judges and court clerks and so on. That’s probably hundreds of hours of work and thousands of dollars wasted. And that money would be better spent by simply offering Mr. Two Hands housing without arresting him.”

What will happen with new crop of CA crime bills?

In the aftermath of voters passing Proposition 36 in November to increase penalties for theft and other crimes, some Republican legislators have found their tough-on-crime bills are advancing further than before in a Legislature dominated by Democrats, reports CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
Senate GOP Leader Brian Jones of San Diego, for example, authored a bill that would add regulatory guardrails before the Department of State Hospitals releases sexually violent predators. In his fourth attempt to push the proposal, the Senate Public Safety Committee unanimously approved the bill earlier this month. Last year the proposal died in the Assembly after advancing through the Senate, and in previous years the bill never passed through committee. 
Jones says that after Prop. 36, he noticed a shift among Democrats and their attitudes toward stricter incarceration measures.

Jones: “The smart Democrats are getting it. The voters spoke overwhelmingly.”

But some criminal justice advocates don’t see it that way. Tinisch Hollins, the executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice, pointed out that the Legislature is also advancing bills the organization is sponsoring, including ones that would expand the state’s efforts to clear criminal records and require the California Department of Corrections to apply more good behavior credits to reduce prisoners’ time served.

Hollins: “Even Prop. 36 wasn’t a referendum on reform. There’s still plenty of support for different approaches to public safety that really address the root cause and prevent crime from happening in the first place.”

More federal attacks on CA college students

As part of President Donald Trump’s push to cut assistance to undocumented immigrants, his administration is revoking one vital policy that allows California to help students who don’t have legal status, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
In 2022 the federal TRIO programs — which provides financial assistance and counseling to low-income and first-generation college students — granted California special permission to also serve students who don’t have legal status. But in March, the U.S. Department of Education said it was revoking waivers to California colleges and universities that use federal funds to “provide services to illegal aliens.”
It’s difficult to track how many California college students lack legal status, but some data suggests that it could number in the thousands — most of whom attend community colleges. More than 100,000 California students are reportedly enrolled in TRIO programs.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez held his mother in a tight embrace and wept following his release from the Leon County Jail Thursday evening, where the U.S. citizen was held after his arrest for illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien.”
An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.

Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans ruled Thursday morning that she lacked jurisdiction to release him because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him for 48 hours.

Often, not much",Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/04/homeless-camping-california-trial/,"Wickey Two Hands was supposed to be the first person tried for camping in Fresno. Instead, after the city and county poured resources into his case, it was dismissed at the last minute.","In summary
Wickey Two Hands was supposed to be the first person tried for camping in Fresno. Instead, after the city and county poured resources into his case, it was dismissed at the last minute.


Wickey Two Hands sat at the defense table on a recent Thursday morning, holding in his lap the red baseball cap he’d doffed out of respect for the judge. 
The 77-year-old homeless man was supposed to be the first person tried in court under an ordinance Fresno passed last year making it a crime to camp in all public places. Over the past six months, he’d spent hours in a courtroom, arriving early for each hearing. He’d packed up and moved his campsite multiple times, trying to find out-of-the-way spots where he could avoid getting arrested again. 
But instead of sending Two Hands’ case before a jury, the judge — on the day trial was supposed to begin — dismissed all charges. The reason? The city waited too long to prosecute. 
Two Hands’ case shines a spotlight on a contradiction seen around the state in recent months. California cities are passing ordinances left and right that allow police to arrest or cite unhoused people for camping on their streets and sidewalks, or in their parks. Police are making arrests. But when it comes to prosecuting, trying or sentencing people for violating these ordinances, some cities haven’t been able to follow through. In many cases, prosecutors aren’t filing charges. If people are charged, their cases often are dismissed quickly. Two Hands’ case was a rarity for how close it came to trial. But in the end, it too was thrown out.
That has some wondering: what’s the point of arresting people at all?
Two Hands’ case was set to be a bellwether to see if Fresno’s camping ban — under which police have made several hundred arrests already — would hold up before a jury. The city and county — as well as Two Hands’ lawyer, activists and even local journalists — invested a considerable amount of resources in the case before it was ultimately dismissed last week without a trial or any public hearings on its merits.
“They wasted a lot of time and money pursuing this case,” said Ron Hochbaum, a law professor at the University of the Pacific who specializes in homelessness and poverty law. “When you think about all the people who were involved, from police to the city attorney’s office to judges and court clerks and so on. That’s probably hundreds of hours of work and thousands of dollars wasted. And that money would be better spent by simply offering Mr. Two Hands housing without arresting him.”

CalMatters analyzed the resources that went into prosecuting Two Hands’ case: 
At 8:40 a.m. on Oct. 14, 2024, two Fresno police officers came across Two Hands and his belongings on the side of the road and arrested him for camping in a public place and illegally possessing a shopping cart. 
Over the next six months, Two Hands attended four hearings in three different courtrooms. Before each hearing, he dropped off his belongings at a friend’s house and then caught the bus to the downtown Fresno courthouse, sometimes arriving as much as an hour early so he didn’t miss anything. After court, an advocate sometimes drove him back to his campsite. On April 10, the day his trial was supposed to begin, he missed work to attend court, skipping his scheduled shift at a wrecking yard and with it, his chance to earn money for food and other necessities for the day. 
City and county resources also went into each hearing. Public funds paid for the presence of a judge, a bailiff and staff from the city attorney’s office. The city brought on outside law firm Manning Kass to help prosecute the case. 
Kevin Little, a private attorney who specializes in civil rights litigation, signed on to defend Two Hands pro bono. Little estimates he spent between 100 and 150 hours on Two Hands’ case. He had two additional staff members helping him, and they put in another 50 to 100 hours. The week the case was supposed to go to trial, Little said he spent a couple nights working in his office until 3 a.m. 
“They wasted a lot of time and money pursuing this case.”Ron Hochbaum, law professor, University of the Pacific
Another attorney, Patience Milrod, was also in court on April 10. She was there to represent Pablo Orihuela, a Fresnoland journalist who had been covering Two Hands’ case and received a subpoena to testify on behalf of the prosecution. Attorney Karl Olson was standing by to contest a subpoena issued to Fresno Bee reporter Thaddeus Miller, according to the Bee.
In addition to Orihuela and Miller, journalists from CalMatters and ABC30 were there to cover the trial.
About two-dozen activists and local community members also showed up at the courthouse — some arriving as early as 7 a.m. despite work and childcare obligations — to support Two Hands on the day his trial was set to start. Activist Wes White drove two-and-a-half hours from Salinas to be there. 
After all that, Judge Brian Alvarez dismissed the case. He found that the trial should have started by March 6, and going past that date would violate Two Hands’ right to a speedy trial. Two Hands’ supporters filed out of the courtroom and filled the hallway, cheering, until a bailiff asked them to keep it down.

“I’m really shocked by how much money and resources they put into this,” said advocate Dez Martinez, who recently helped Two Hands get into a shelter. “There was so much money used in this so they can make a point because they don’t want to lose a case. It just bothers me that they used that (many resources) and finances into punishing Wickey instead of doing what I did: sit down and talk to him, figure out why does he not want to go inside.”
The trial originally was set to start Feb. 20, but the city asked for a delay, which was granted by Judge Carlos Cabrera. Judge Alvarez appeared to disagree with that ruling. 
The city blamed Two Hands’ team for the case getting thrown out. The defense’s subpoena request forced the city to review an extensive amount of documents, which took extra time, Deputy City Attorney Daniel Cisneros told the court. The city also had tried to prevent the case from going to trial by offering Two Hands a plea deal, which it said would come with a shelter bed. Two Hands declined, instead opting to try to clear his name through a trial. 
“The City’s position is to continue to offer plea deals to defendants who accept housing and services offered by the City,” the city attorney’s office said in an emailed statement from Noemi Schwartz. “It is unfortunate that this defendant declined the services and housing offered by City at a congregate shelter at Travel Inn and will likely end up back on the streets without shelter and assistance.”
Fresno’s new camping ordinance went into effect in September, making it a misdemeanor to sit, lie, sleep or camp in a public place. But most people arrested aren’t prosecuted, and even fewer come close to a trial. Fresno police made 322 arrests under that ordinance from October 2024 through January 2025. During that time, the city attorney’s office filed charges in just 132 camping cases. The defendant failed to show up in court in more than half of the cases in which charges were filed. Only one other case, in addition to Two Hands’, was listed as headed toward trial. 
It’s a similar situation in other cities, from the Bay Area to Southern California. Police in Los Angeles made 238 camping arrests last year, and the city attorney’s office declined to file charges in two-thirds of those cases. In San Francisco, nearly four in five illegal lodging arrests made since August 2024 have not resulted in charges, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
“Cities and district attorneys aren’t interested in prosecuting the cases because they know they don’t have enough room in jail and prisons to incarcerate everyone who is experiencing homelessness,” Hochbaum said. And they know slapping someone with a fine won’t stop them from sleeping outside, he said.
Instead, he said, many cities are using the threat of arrest to force unhoused people to move when they want to clear an encampment. 
For the time being, Two Hands is sleeping inside after five years on the street. Martinez said she got him a 90-day stay at a city-run shelter — with no help from the city attorney’s office. 
“(It’s) a pretty good day in my life,” Two Hands said outside the courthouse, after his case was dismissed. “77 seasons I’ve been here, you know, I think I deserve it.”
While Two Hands was hesitant to accept a shelter bed at first, Martinez said after spending months talking to him, getting to know him and showing up at his side to his court dates, she won his trust. She promised to keep fighting to get Two Hands into permanent housing, sign him up for Social Security, help him access health care, and get him whatever else he needs. 
“It’s not that he wants to stay outside,” Martinez said. “He’s tired. He doesn’t want to die on the sidewalk. He didn’t want to be given something and have it be taken away.”
Fresno still has yet to try anyone for sleeping outside, but that could change. Little is representing another unhoused man who was arrested for camping — and plans on bringing that case to trial. 
“I hope the message the city gets,” Little said, “is leave the unhoused alone. Help them and don’t prosecute them. But if you are going to choose unfortunately to prosecute these cases, then you better come ready, because we’re not backing down.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041025_Homeless-Case_AP_CM_35.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

Chuck Bonham
Charlton H. Bonham is the director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.


This week, a public federal process determined there will be no commercial salmon fishing off California’s coast for the third year in a row. It’s a grim milestone for our state. 
While we will see some recreational ocean fishing, we’re at the low-water mark. With so few fish available, we know this won’t be enough to meet the demand of our state. That’s hard news in hard times.
Thirty years ago, the idea we would be implementing — yet alone discussing — these restrictions would have been unthinkable. Back then, millions of salmon swam through the rivers of California every year. It was a bountiful, thriving species.
But last year, the number of adult salmon in the Sacramento Index, a critical measure of the Sacramento River salmon population and an indicator of the overall health of California’s salmon, shrunk to roughly 100,000 fish. It’s a tiny fraction of salmon’s former might.
The reasons for the decline are numerous and complicated. Decades of severe drought, climate disruption, water management challenges and habitat loss threaten the future of salmon in California. The loss of salmon would wound California deeply.
Salmon are the basis of a multibillion-dollar fishing economy that creates jobs across the state. They support thriving forests, rivers and floodplains, and serve as one of the most popular seafood choices across the country. Salmon provide vital subsistence to numerous California Tribes. Recreational salmon fishing trips form the basis of family legend and lore.
For the salmon lovers among us, these are dark times. But I see glimmers of hope.
Two weeks ago, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife revealed the progress on California’s “Salmon Strategy for a Hotter, Drier Future.” It was an update on the strategy Gov. Gavin Newsom released last year, which outlined dozens of key action items the state must take to better support healthy salmon populations.
In the last year alone, state fish and wildlife and its partner agencies have made critical headway on nearly 70% of the action items set by Gov. Newsom. Another 26% are already done.
California finished removing the outdated and obsolete Klamath River dams, allowing for a free-flowing river and access to cold-water habitats blocked for more than a century.
California’s initiative to fast-track approvals for salmon restoration projects led to the streamlining of more than 60 important projects to support salmon populations over the past year.
Fish and wildlife has also worked with the State Water Resources Control Board to develop flow recommendations in drought-prone watersheds like the Scott and Shasta rivers and Mill and Deer creeks, ensuring salmon populations have enough cold water to survive during dry periods.
Investments to expand and modernize the state’s fish hatcheries, ensuring California is supporting the production of a resilient salmon population, have increased fall run production from state-operated hatcheries in the Central Valley by over 9.7 million fish.
The state’s salmon strategy was designed for long-term salmon support. But we’re already seeing early benefits, some that even surprised fish and wildlife officials. Ten days after the final Klamath dam came down, state scientists spotted salmon swimming north of the dam sites into Oregon. 
Experts originally estimated that would take 10 years.
Data shows that, while salmon numbers from 2024 are down, California saw the highest number of jacks (2-year-old fish) returning to the Central Valley since 2019. Jacks are an important predictor of the number of adult salmon that will return to spawn the following year.
In Lagunitas Creek, there’s been a 60% increase in spawning of endangered Coho salmon. In Mendocino County, adult coho returns have almost quadrupled their 15-year average.
To be clear, these wins are just the beginning. The road to reviving California salmon will be long. But these successes give me hope and the drive to keep fighting for salmon.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/110723-Yreka-And-Klamath-Falls-LV_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

Are Democrats shifting their way?,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/04/california-democrats-crime/,A California Republican state senator finds his crime bills getting a warmer welcome this year. Democrats say they’re just responding to their voters.,"In summary
A California Republican state senator finds his crime bills getting a warmer welcome this year. Democrats say they’re just responding to their voters.


Republican state Sen. Brian Jones has been trying to block sex offenders from being released from prison through California’s elderly parole program for several years. Last week, for the first time, his bill to do so made it out of its first committee. 
It was just one of many votes Senate Bill 286 will have to survive in a long road ahead in the Capitol, but it caught Jones’ attention. In a Legislature dominated by Democrats who often shelve Republican tough-on-crime proposals, the approval from the Senate Public Safety Committee was unanimous.
“I don’t think it would have passed a committee last year,” said Jones, the Senate minority leader.
California’s Democratic legislators — who for years have been passing progressive measures designed to reduce sentences and lessen mass incarceration by emphasizing more rehabilitative solutions to crime — were dealt a blow last fall when an overwhelming majority of voters approved Proposition 36. 
The measure backed by business owners, police and Republicans, increased sentences for some drug and theft crimes, partially undoing more lenient measures that voters approved just 10 years ago. Though many Democrats opposed the measure, they’re now tasked with providing funding to carry it out.
Jones, of San Diego, said he’s seeing Democrats inching toward stricter incarceration measures as a result. He said he saw a window to bring back the legislation this year.
“The smart Democrats are getting it,” he said. “The voters spoke overwhelmingly.”
The Public Safety Committee also gave unanimous approval this month for another bill Jones authored, SB 379, that would add regulatory guardrails before the Department of State Hospitals releases sexually violent predators. It’s his fourth year in a row pushing that measure; the proposal passed the Senate and died in the Assembly last year, after failing to clear a single committee both years before that. SB 432, authored by a different Republican senator to increase penalties for selling or giving fentanyl to minors, also got unanimous approval in the committee this month. 
Freshman Sen. Jesse Arreguín, an Oakland Democrat who chairs the committee, said his fellow Democrats don’t intend to return to an era of overcrowded prisons or harsh penalties for lower-level crimes. But he acknowledged they’re also shifting their thinking in response to their voters, and called that approach “pragmatic.”
“That was the direction I was given as chair of the Public Safety Committee, was that we need to provide more balance in terms of how we look at criminal justice policy,” he said, referring to the Democratic caucus. “Just focusing specifically on restorative justice and prevention, and not focusing on accountability (for offenders), that’s not where the voters are now.”
Criminal justice reforms still advancing
So far, the shift hasn’t been enough to worry Tinisch Hollins, executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice, a group that advocates for reduced imprisonment and pushed for the 2014 sentencing changes that voters approved.
She pointed to bills her organization has sponsored that are also advancing through the Legislature, including legislation to expand the state’s efforts to clear criminal records to give past offenders second chances, and to require that the California Department of Corrections apply more good behavior credits to reduce prisoners’ time served. With the state tight on cash, she said she doesn’t believe lawmakers will be eager to significantly increase imprisonment and sees a “consensus that we shouldn’t go back that way.”
“Even Prop. 36 wasn’t a referendum on reform,” Hollins said. “There’s still plenty of support for different approaches to public safety that really address the root cause and prevent crime from happening in the first place.”
Any stricter measures the Legislature approves this year will ultimately be narrow, with Republicans pointing to extreme examples to push their case.

Jones’ elderly parole bill targets a program the Corrections Department first created in 2014, in response to a court order to reduce prison crowding, that allows prisoners who are older than 60 and have served at least 25 years of their sentences to petition for release. 
He tried in 2019 to restrict those convicted of sex offenses from being eligible; the bill never got a hearing. In 2020, lawmakers quietly lowered the eligibility for some prisoners to age 50, if they’ve served at least 20 years, though many have not been approved for release. The following year, Jones proposed a bill undoing that change for sex offenders, which went nowhere.
Between January 2021 and June 2024, the Board of Parole Hearings released 1,762 people through the elderly parole program, corrections spokesperson Emily Humpal wrote in an email. Department data analyzed by CalMatters show that while more people have been released under the elder program since 2021, the rates at which the board grants parole fluctuate between 14% and 20% each year, hovering just above the board’s overall parole-granting rate. The department would not immediately provide a breakdown of their convictions, nor of how many of those released were between the ages of 50 and 60.
Now, 12,303 people currently imprisoned – nearly 14% of the prison population – are eligible for either form of elderly parole, Humpal said.
Jones’ bill would bar those convicted of sexual felonies such as rape and child sexual abuse from parole eligibility at age 50. It would not affect their eligibility upon turning 60, or the parole eligibility date in their original sentences. 
He also proposed blocking the earlier eligibility from people convicted of murder, but Arreguín’s committee removed that provision with Jones’ agreement before voting to advance the bill. 
Proponents of the measure, including San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan, say victims shouldn’t be forced to relive the trauma of parole hearings and the prospect of their abusers’ release before the end of their original sentences. 
They point to Mary Johnson, who identified herself as the childhood victim of rape and sexual abuse by her uncle. The abuser, Cody Klemp, was originally sentenced in the 1990s to 170 years. In 2023, under the elderly parole program, the Board of Parole Hearings recommended his release — then rescinded the decision last year. His next hearing is scheduled for 2029.
“Suddenly, I was no longer a 49-year-old woman, but I was a 13-year-old trapped and powerless and fighting again,” Johnson said in a press conference. “No victim’s family should have to fight over and over again to ensure that a dangerous predator serves the sentence that they were given.”
Closing the doors on the rehabilitated?
A group of criminal justice reform and civil rights advocates including the American Civil Liberties Union opposes the legislation, arguing it would close the door on those who have been rehabilitated in prison and pose less of a public safety risk. Studies have found the chances of re-offense decrease as a defendant ages. 
Gary Harrell, who was given a life sentence for his participation in a murder, testified that despite becoming eligible for parole in 1984, he wasn’t released until about 40 years later, after he had gone before the parole board about 20 times. He said in the last two decades of his incarceration, he turned his life around, and now works a day job while in his spare time giving homeless Sacramento residents food and hygiene products. 
“I have taken so much from others and now it’s time to give back and do my part to make the world a better place,” he said. “I hope you can see that the people who will be impacted by this bill are people like me who have changed and want to give back.”
Arreguín said he proposed removing Jones’ exclusion of people convicted of murder to focus the bill on sex offenses. 
That tactic has yielded bipartisan backing in the last legislative session.
In 2023, Republican Sen. Shannon Grove of Bakersfield pushed a bill to increase penalties for child sex trafficking. Democrats in the Assembly Public Safety Committee resisted but, after a public outcry, Gov. Gavin Newsom stepped in with rare public comments in support of the legislation, which ultimately won more Democratic support and his signature.
Last year Grove’s bill to increase penalties for soliciting a minor for prostitution — targeting the buyers of sex — also prevailed. Senate Democrats carved out exclusions for 16- and 17-year-olds who are allegedly solicited, out of concern it would inadvertently rope in older teenagers who aren’t actually involved in or victims of trafficking. (The legal age of consent is 18.) This year, Grove is turning heads with a bill, Assembly Bill 379, co-authored with an Assembly Democrat, to undo those exclusions and apply the changes to all minors. 
Jones acknowledged the tactic of focusing on sexual offenses is an incremental step toward tightening criminal sentences overall. 
“We’re smart enough to know how far we can go,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/031723-SAN-QUENTIN-REHABILITATION-CENTER-MHN-08-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

(Photo: Alejanda Rubio/Nevada Current)President Donald Trump’s efforts to carry out mass deportations and detain legal permanent residents and green card recipients has created increased “fear and uncertainty” throughout the state, immigrant groups have told Nevada lawmakers. 
Two bills proposed this session, which recently passed out of committee, seek to provide a measure of reassurance to anxious families. One would protect students from being taken from school by immigration officials. Another would establish a procedure for families to select potential temporary guardians if parents are deported. 
“While we may not have control over the events that are unfolding on a national scale, we do have the power to make a meaningful impact within our own communities,” Noé Orosco, the Government Affairs Manager with Make the Road Nevada, told lawmakers in March. 
The Trump administration has defied court orders seeking to restrict aggressive federal immigration tactics, and rescinded long-standing policies that prohibit immigration enforcement in “sensitive” places such as schools, churches, and hospitals.
‘Afraid to attend school’
Assembly Bill 217 would prohibit school employees from granting permission to immigration officers to enter a school, or provide student records, including information on a student’s family, without a warrant.
“Across the nation, we have seen instances where officers have gone to schools and have intimidated teachers, staff and students,” said Democratic Assemblymember Cecelia González, who sponsored the bill. “This is really a response to the fears of our students, staff and families and mixed-status families.”
González, who presented the bill to the Assembly Education Committee in March, said Clark and Washoe county school districts already have existing policies to prevent employees from granting permission to immigration enforcement officials seeking to enter a school.
The bill would simply codify that policy and ensure other districts throughout the state follow suit. 
González sought to make a violation of the law a misdemeanor, which received pushback from Nevada Association of School Boards.
The bill was amended so the first violation “will be disciplined under the discretion of each school district.” School employees could face a misdemeanor charge for any subsequent violation. 
The original version of the bill also prevented school police from using tasers and “chemical agents” such as pepper spray on students but was edited out of the legislation to focus on immigration enforcement. 
Orosco, who presented the bill alongside González, said the legislation was needed to address “an overwhelming sense of fear and uncertainty, particularly those who come from mixed-status families.”
The anxiety students feel about losing a parent to deportation, or being taken as well, “follows them into the classroom where it severely impacts their ability to concentrate and engage in learning,” he said.
“Many students are afraid to attend school because they worry about their family safety,” he said. “The thought of immigration enforcement officers potentially being present on campuses creates an environment of distress.” 
AB 217 passed out of committee in late March with only Republican Assemblymember Richard Delong opposed.
“My concern with the bill, and I will be a no on this, is because there’s a chance that federal law could change in the future and thus we set up a situation where no matter what a school official does, they’re going to be in violation of one law or another,” he said. “I don’t want to put anyone in that position”
Democratic Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett, the committee chair, pointed out that “federal law can change at any point, and our state laws could be a violation of federal law at any point.”
‘Solutions that prioritize family unity’
González, along with Democratic state Sen. Fabian Doñate, are also sponsoring Assembly Bill 460 that seeks a streamlined process for selecting a temporary guardian for minors prior to any immigration action.
“I think there’s some value in the fact that individuals were coming to us with this solution, and so that’s why we’re putting that bill forward,” Doñate said during the March bill hearing.
Nevada is home to one of the largest populations of mixed-status families in the country, González said at the hearing.
A 2020 report published by the American Immigration Council estimated that “about one in seven children in the state was a U.S. citizen living with at least one undocumented family member.” Some estimates put that number in Nevada at one in 10 households 
Both figures make it likely that throughout the state “that in every single one of our districts there are hard working families that pay taxes and contribute to our community, yet live with the daily fear of separation,” González said. 
The legislation, which passed unanimously out of committee last week, would establish a form for parents or guardians to nominate a temporary guardian for a minor. 
The form would need to be signed by the parent or guardian, two “impartial adult witnesses” and notarized before being placed in the Nevada Lockbox, an electronic registry maintained by the Nevada Secretary of State.
The legislation would require “a court to consider the form requesting to nominate a guardian of a minor in determining which person is most suitable to be the guardian for the minor,” González said. 
“Regardless of where we stand on immigration policy, we can all agree that children should not bear the brunt of these challenges,” González said. “As policymakers, we have a responsibility to provide solutions that prioritize family unity, stability and the well being of our most vulnerable children.”
The original version of the bill also sought to expand eligibility for welfare support assistance for children living with guardians if an immigration order led to their separation. It also allocated $2 million to the Nevada’s Department of Education for the Trauma Recovery Grant Project, which provides funding for trauma support for children.  
Both were removed from the bill. 
“It’s not lost on me the conversations that we’ve been having about our state’s budget and what that is going to look like this session and beyond,” she said. “If we have the opportunity to include (the funding), we would love to.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CeciliaGonzalez-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) was finally able to meet Thursday night with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Beltsville resident who was erroneously deported last month to his native El Salvador, where he has been held incommunicado in that country’s megaprison for terrorists.
The meeting followed two days of attempts by Van Hollen to see Abrego Garcia, including an attempt earlier Thursday when soldiers turned away him and Chris Newman — the lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s wife and his mother — at a checkpoint about 3 kilometers away from the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, where Abrego Garcia is being held.
Van Hollen said that while the soldiers allowed other cars to pass, they said they had “been ordered not to allow us to proceed any further than that point.”
It is unclear what led to the the change in policy, but Van Hollen posted a photo on social media after 9 p.m. Thursday of him talking with Abrego Garcia.
“I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance,” Van Hollen said in his post. “I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.”
Abrego Garcia, seen in the photos in jeans, a checkered shirt and a Kansas City Chiefs ballcap, appears healthy. It was a different look than the shaved heads, baggy white shorts and T-shirts and Crocs or sandals that CECOT inmates are wearing in most photos of the facility.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who insisted during a White House meeting Monday with President Donald Trump that his country had no intention of releasing Abrego Garcia, trolled Van Hollen with his own social media posts of the meeting shortly before the senator’s Thursday. Bukele mockingly referred to Abrego Garcia “miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture,’ now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador.”
“Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody,” Bukele posted.
Van Hollen unsuccessfully sought a meeting when Bukele was in Washington, and again when he traveled to El Salvador Wednesday. He was able to meet instead with Salvadoran Vice President Félix Ulloa, who denied his requests Wednesday to either visit or speak on the phone with Abrego Garcia.
The Maryland Democrat arrived in the Central American country Wednesday in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia, whom the Justice Department admitted in court was deported in error, back to the United States, or at least check on his wellness.
A U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 allowing Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant in the U,S., to daus here because sending him back to his home country would put him in grave danger from gangs there that he said caused him to flee in the first place.
Van Hollen said that since Abrego Garcia was sent to CECOT, he had not spoken with anyone outside of the prison walls until their meeting Thursday. “This inability to communicate with his lawyers is a violation of international law,” Van Hollen had said earlier Thursday.
The senator pointed out that El Salvador is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
“That covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,’” he said.
Van Hollen also said he met with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and they discussed “the full range of important bilateral relations between the United States and El Salvador.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other Republicans have criticized Van Hollen for making the trip, repeating the accusation that Abrego Garcia is a gang member.
Representatives for the White House and DHS did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.
Appeals court slams administration’s inaction
Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s case continues to work its way through U.S. courts as a flashpoint conflict between two branches of government that has led to the precipice of a constitutional crisis.
On Thursday, a federal appeals court panel dismantled the administration’s latest appeal, saying the government had done “essentially nothing” to attempt to return Abrego Garcia in compliance with last week’s Supreme Court order.
A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said the executive branch was due deference in conducting foreign policy, but that the administration’s inaction in seeking Abrego Garcia’s return amounted to defiance of a judicial order.
The unanimous ruling was written by 4th Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan. The other two judges, Robert Bruce King and Stephanie Thacker, were nominated by Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done,” the panel wrote. “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”
The appeals ruling responded to the government’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ order this week for the Trump administration to offer evidence on how it has sought to help with Abrego Garcia’s release from CECOT.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” — but stopped short of requiring — his return to the United States.
In unusually frank language, the 4th Circuit panel warned Thursday the conflict between the executive and judicial branches threatened the foundation of U.S. government.
“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” the court asked. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present.”
Near the end of the order, the panel urged the administration to obey the judicial branch.
“We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos,” the judges wrote. “This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.”
Neither country taking action
The 4th Circuit panel pointed out that the leaders of both the United States and El Salvador claimed they had no power to return Abrego Garcia.
“We are told that neither government has the power to act,” they wrote. “The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.”
During a White House visit this week, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he would not bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.
The Trump administration has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error.” The administration continues to accuse him of being part of the gang MS-13, despite no charges or convictions of any criminal offenses against him, including gang-related crimes.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Utah has rates of sexual violence that often trump the national average — according to the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office, 1 in 3 Utah women will experience sexual violence, compared to 1 in 5 women nationally.  
Yet this year, the state’s service providers are forced to fundraise and solicit federal money, which is increasingly short supply, after lawmakers snubbed the Utah Coalition Against Sexual Assault’s request for funding that would have gone to the state’s rape crisis programs. According to the request, the money was intended to provide “meaningful sexual prevention work,” like education and training. 
“Prevention education works. It can change the way individuals think. It can change the way communities interact. It changes relationships. It is the least funded source of service for victims in the state of Utah,” said Gary Scheller, associate director of the Rape Recovery Center.
The coalition asked lawmakers for almost $3.3 million — the Legislature’s Social Services Appropriations Committee recommended just over $1.6 million. But ultimately, funding for the coalition was not included in the final budget.

Now, with April being Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Scheller’s nonprofit, which provides advocacy for victims, clinical therapy, education and training, will be forced to fundraise and look to the federal government to fill the void.  
Lawmakers said it was a tight budget year, and a number of programs never received funding. Still, some of the programs funded by the state’s nearly $30 billion budget include $40 million in annual funds for the Utah Fits All Scholarship voucher program, $20 million in one-time funding for the state’s first-time home buyer program, and dozens of other programs and allocations that cost far more than what the Coalition Against Sexual Assault was asking for. 
“What I would like to say really loudly to our state Legislature is, what you fund reflects your priorities,” Scheller said on Thursday during an event at the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office marking Sexual Assault Awareness Month. “So when we see millions going here and millions going there and this being cut and that being cut, that is equivalent to the state Legislature saying, these are our priorities, these not so much.”
The Utah Domestic Violence Coalition is in a similar boat, after their request for $200,000 in annual funds was also left out of the state’s budget. The money would have allowed police departments around the state to continue to administer a critical health care service for victims of domestic violence while bolstering investigations.
Legislature snubs funding for domestic violence health care service, forcing nonprofit to fundraise

Scheller said the lack of state funds will have a “significant” impact to the Rape Recovery Center.  
The center, and other sexual assault support programs, have been sharing a $600,000 allocation from the state spread out over three years — for the Rape Recovery Center, that’s about $15,000 to $20,000 each year, according to Scheller. 
Now that the Legislature snubbed their request this year, Scheller said education and prevention programs, which are already underfunded, will continue to be spread thin. 
“These prevention and education programs, with state school board approved curriculum, where we can get into schools and talk to students about consent and healthy relationships — those will be greatly minimized. So now we’re going to go looking for other ways to continue to do that,” Scheller said. 
Sex crimes continue to be an issue in Utah. According to Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill, 88 out of 100 women who are sexually assaulted in Utah will choose not to come forward. Of the 12 that do report the crime, six will likely be re-victimized “though the way that we respond to them,” Gill said. “Because we’re not trauma informed, because we’re not victim centered.” 
Data from Gill’s office shows the extent of sexual violence in the county, which fluctuates year to year. 
The office filed 81 rape charges in 2023, compared to 89 in 2024; 51 object rape charges in 2023, compared to 54 in 2024; 22 rape of a child charges in 2023, compared to 10 in 2024; 104 sex battery charges in 2024, compared to 72 in 2024; 100 lewdness charges in 2023, compared to 90 in 2024; 35 sodomy of a child charges in 2023, compared to 26 in 2024; and 20 aggravated sexual assault charges in 2023, compared to 15 in 2024. 
“I hope this encourages our policymakers to know that they need to fully fund our institutional partners and our community partners,” Gill said.

The legislation passed despite attempts from minority Democrats in both chambers to counter passage of the legislation. In the Senate, the majority GOP used cloture petitions and procedural moves to effectively prevent Democrats from debating the measures.  
Speaking after the House adjourned Thursday, Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, said HB 437, sponsored by Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, establishing a shark alert system and the first bill on the agenda, was the exception to a day where time “was spent on things that will not move Alabama forward.” 
Other than that, the agenda consisted of an expansion of the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law; a ban on drag performances; a mandate for displaying the Ten Commandments in public schools; a bill allowing local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws and a bill renaming the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.”
Drummond said the Legislature should be preparing for cuts to federal spending proposed by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. The possible reduction include more than $800 million to Alabama Medicaid, a cornerstone of health care in the state. 
“We’ve got about, what about less than 10 days left in this session. And when we leave and those cuts happen, our children, as well as the citizens of Alabama, are going to be left with no recourse,” Drummond said. “What will they do? How will we fill these holes?”
High tension in the Senate
The atmosphere in the Senate became tense as majority Republicans clotured debate six times and kept Democratic senators from speaking on bills. Republican senators spoke at length on each of their own bills and asked for their bills to be read at length after calling for cloture, effectively excluding Democrats from debate for most of the Thursday session.
That led to a brief, heated exchange between Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, and Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth. Singleton, who tried to get Ainsworth’s attention several times, asked what he needed to do to be recognized.
“Do we have to shout?” Singleton asked.
Ainsworth maintained Singleton was out of order and he would be recognized when appropriate.
“Here’s the deal – It’s my decision who to recognize. For seven years, right now seven years, since I’ve been in here, always to the sponsor and I always go back to the sponsor and I’m going to continue doing that,” Ainsworth said to Singleton.
Senate Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said in a statement sent during the session that “Senate Republicans are serious about promoting conservative policies.”
“Senate Republicans are holding the line. We’re standing up for Alabama families and fighting for the values that make this state such a special place to live, work, worship, and raise children,” Gudger said in the statement.

‘Fundamentally unconstitutional’

Democrats in the House got more opportunities to speak, though Republicans clotured debate on the “Gulf of America” bill.
Thursday was the 23rd day of the 2025 legislative session. The Legislature can meet for up to 30 days in a 105-day calendar period. The last day the Legislature can meet is May 20. 
“The Legislature is not taking any action. The leadership of the state has not taken any action to put forth information so we can be working on a plan to help the people in our town, our state, absorb some of these cuts, or we rearrange some of the things we are doing to make up for some of the things that’s going to be lost,” Rep. Sam Jones, D-Mobile, said.
Rep. Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, criticized the agenda, saying most of the bills would end up in court and cost Alabama over $500,000, like previously challenged laws. 
“The number one thing that we did today was taxpayers money by passing out of this house bills that are fundamentally unconstitutional on its face,” Tillman said. “There will be a ton of challenges to these bills if they become law.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9167-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

The chamber adopted a committee substitute 76-8 that removed a portion of the bill that would prohibit educators from referring to students by their preferred gender if it conflicts with their assigned sex at birth.
Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, objected to the measure, saying kids would be less receptive to learning if they did not feel welcome in a classroom. 
“If they don’t trust a teacher, if they think a teacher doesn’t like them or use them differently or views them as unequal, they’re not going to be as open to learning,” he said.
Gidley rebutted, saying students could still confide in a teacher, but the teacher has to stick to the curriculum during instructional time. He said he has received complaints from a student that said their teacher could not teach without mentioning “all things gay and transgender.” He did not say, and has previously declined to say, which school this happened in.
“That is not part of the curriculum, or what the parents signed up for, and not what the parents are paying for,” he said.
Rep. Neil Rafferty, D-Birmingham, the only openly gay member of the House, used his debate time to address LGBTQ+ Alabamians.
“I want you to know you are not the problem. You are not broken, and you’re absolutely not alone,” Rafferty said. “They’re not theories. They’re not talking points, not threats to be neutralized. They’re people. They’re Alabamian, and they deserve better than what we are offering them right now.”
The bill now moves to the Senate.
The House also passed a bill that prohibits public schools and libraries from hosting drag performances in the presence of children without parental consent.
HB 67, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, passed 76-9 with no discussion. The legislation defines drag performances as “a performance in which a performer exhibits a sex identity that is different from the sex assigned to the performer at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers.”
The bill now moves to the Senate.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), right, meets with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident who was erroneously deported to El Salvador by ICE agents last month. (Photo courtesy Sen. Van Hollen)Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) was finally able to meet Thursday night with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident who was erroneously deported last month to his native El Salvador, where he has been held incommunicado in that country’s megaprison for terrorists.
The meeting followed two days of attempts by Van Hollen to see Abrego Garcia, including an attempt earlier Thursday when soldiers turned away him and Chris Newman — the lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s wife and his mother — at a checkpoint about 3 kilometers away from the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, where Abrego Garcia is being held.
Van Hollen said that while the soldiers allowed other cars to pass, they said they had “been ordered not to allow us to proceed any further than that point.”
It is unclear what led to the the change in policy, but Van Hollen posted a photo on social media after 9 p.m. Thursday of him talking with Abrego Garcia.
“I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance,” Van Hollen said in his post. “I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.”
Abrego Garcia, seen in the photos in jeans, a checkered shirt and a Kansas City Chiefs ballcap, appears healthy. It was a different look than the shaved heads, baggy white shorts and T-shirts and Crocs or sandals that CECOT inmates are wearing in most photos of the facility.
Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who insisted during a White House meeting Monday with President Donald Trump that his country had no intention of releasing Abrego Garcia, trolled Van Hollen with his own social media posts of the meeting shortly before the senator’s Thursday. Bukele mockingly referred to Abrego Garcia “miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture,’ now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador.”
“Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody,” Bukele posted.
Van Hollen unsuccessfully sought a meeting when Bukele was in Washington, and again when he traveled to El Salvador Wednesday. He was able to meet instead with Salvadoran Vice President Félix Ulloa, who denied his requests Wednesday to either visit or speak on the phone with Abrego Garcia.
The Maryland Democrat arrived in the Central American country Wednesday in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia, whom the Justice Department admitted in court was deported in error, back to the United States, or at least check on his wellness.
A U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 allowing Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant, to stay in the U.S. because sending him back to his home country would put him in grave danger from gangs there that he said caused him to flee in the first place.
Van Hollen said that since Abrego Garcia was sent to CECOT, he had not spoken with anyone outside of the prison walls until their meeting Thursday. “This inability to communicate with his lawyers is a violation of international law,” Van Hollen had said earlier Thursday.
The senator pointed out that El Salvador is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
“That covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,’” he said.
Van Hollen also said he met with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and they discussed “the full range of important bilateral relations between the United States and El Salvador.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other Republicans have criticized Van Hollen for making the trip, repeating the accusation that Abrego Garcia is a gang member.
Representatives for the White House and DHS did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.
 Appeals court slams administration’s inaction

Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s case continues to work its way through U.S. courts as a flashpoint conflict between two branches of government that has led to the precipice of a constitutional crisis.
On Thursday, a federal appeals court panel dismantled the administration’s latest appeal, saying the government had done “essentially nothing” to attempt to return Abrego Garcia in compliance with last week’s Supreme Court order.










“This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”


– 4th Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III



	A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said the executive branch was due deference in conducting foreign policy, but that the administration’s inaction in seeking Abrego Garcia’s return amounted to defiance of a judicial order.
The unanimous ruling was written by 4th Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan. The other two judges, Robert Bruce King and Stephanie Thacker, were nominated by Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done,” the panel wrote. “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”
The appeals ruling responded to the government’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ order this week for the Trump administration to offer evidence on how it has sought to help with Abrego Garcia’s release from CECOT.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” — but stopped short of requiring — his return to the United States.
In unusually frank language, the 4th Circuit panel warned Thursday the conflict between the executive and judicial branches threatened the foundation of U.S. government.
“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” the court asked. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present.”
Near the end of the order, the panel urged the administration to obey the judicial branch.
“We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos,” the judges wrote. “This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.”
 Neither country taking action

The 4th Circuit panel pointed out that the leaders of both the United States and El Salvador claimed they had no power to return Abrego Garcia.
“We are told that neither government has the power to act,” they wrote. “The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.”
During a White House visit this week, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he would not bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.
The Trump administration has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error.” The administration continues to accuse him of being part of the gang MS-13, despite no charges or convictions of any criminal offenses against him, including gang-related crimes.

SB 5, sponsored by Sen. Chris Elliot, R-Josephine, would remove the board’s appointing authority and increase its membership by one, from 16 to 17 members. The governor would be the appointing authority for most seats, including members from each congressional district, with eight at-large appointments coming from the speaker, president pro tempore, and the minority leaders of the House and Senate.
“What this bill does is make those appointments not self-appointments, where they may continue to appoint themselves or their friends, but rather appointments from other elected officials that are accountable to the people of the state of Alabama,” Elliot said on the floor.

The Department of Archives & History did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Currently, the Alabama Department of Archives and History has two trustees from each congressional district and two additional at-large members, plus the governor or their designees. The Senate must approve each appointment, which Elliot kept in the proposed bill.
Elliot said when introducing the bill that while the governor gets a majority of appointments, he tried to ensure geographical diversity and kept “standard diversity language … to assure that the membership of the board is inclusive and reflects the racial, gender, geographic, urban and rural and economic diversity of the state.”
Senate Republicans killed debate on every bill Thursday, and Democrats did not have a chance to speak on the board legislation. After the Senate adjourned, Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, said that “this is all about DEI” and that the board has not done anything wrong to warrant the restructuring.
“This is a board that allowed someone, a third party, to come in to be able to utilize their facilities to be able to do history about gay and lesbians in this state. That’s what this is all about,” Singleton said.
Elliot was one of several Republicans who attacked the Archives Department for hosting a presentation on LGBTQ+ history in Alabama in June 2023, claiming the board is not accountable to elected officials, calling it a “unicorn.”
Elliott then introduced a bill in the redistricting special session in mid-2023 to strip Archives of $5 million, which did not pass.
He also introduced a similar bill for the 2024 legislative session that would have given state officials and legislative leaders the power to appoint board members, while keeping the board size the same. The bill passed the Senate and a House committee but did not reach the House floor.

In response to economic uncertainty, the University of Missouri System is imposing immediate hiring restrictions, purchasing controls and slowing spending.
The cost-saving measures, which aim for a minimum $16 million in savings for fiscal year 2025, were presented Thursday at the Board of Curators meeting in Rolla.
While the system “remains well positioned with a strong balance sheet,” broader pressures on the higher education sector are spurring such cuts, said Ryan Rapp, UM System executive vice president for Finance and Operations.
One of the key concerns is potential cuts to federal research funding, such as those from the National Institutes of Health.
“NIH is the largest funder of university research throughout the United States. And so to replace the level of funding that potentially can be at risk is very significant,” UM System President Mun Choi said. “We will continue to make the case to NIH and other agencies and educate them on the value of our research so that the funds will continue to flow to the University of Missouri.”
Part of the system’s financial strategy, Rapp said, is keeping administrative spending low and maintaining current academic spending.
The system spends just over a quarter of its labor budget on administration, Rapp said, compared to a 38.5% benchmark average. Additionally, 56.8% of its labor budget is allotted to academics, exceeding the 52.5% average at peer institutions.
The University of Missouri has also cut educational expenses per degree awarded by 20% since 2017, according to Rapp’s report. More “moderate” tuition increases are expected, with state appropriations projected to rise by 1.5%. The curators increased tuition by 5% for all undergraduates in May 2024, and will vote on tuition and fee rates for fiscal year 2026 at its May meeting.
Even amid the UM system’s economic stress, Choi boasted increased application rates for fall 2025 at all four universities. First-time college applications showed double-digit increases with MU at 12%, the University of Missouri-Kansas City at 15%, Missouri University of Science and Technology at 15% and the University of Missouri-St. Louis at 5%.
“We are very proud of the work that our faculty, staff and administrators have done to share the message that we provide a very high-quality, affordable education at our universities,” Choi said.
The curators also approved two new degree programs at the meeting: a doctoral program in human development and family science at MU and a masters in geospatial engineering at Missouri S&T.
MU’s Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory building was officially renamed the Dr. Dan Brown Building, in honor of the late veterinarian and former state senator.
Board Chair Todd Graves highlighted recent system milestones, including the April 2 ribbon cutting for a 47,000 square foot addition to the MU’s research reactor and the Wednesday groundbreaking of a 127,000-square-foot Bioplex research hub at Missouri S&T.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/18/ct-tax-delinquents-drivers-licenses/,The measure is sparking pushback from some who say it unfairly targets the poor while CT treats wealthy delinquent taxpayers with kid gloves.,"Faced with a slumping economy and likely big cuts in federal aid, state legislators are once again weighing whether to turn delinquent taxpayers over to collection agencies — and block renewal of their driver’s licenses or vehicle registrations.
But the measure also is sparking pushback from groups that say it unfairly targets the poor even as Connecticut treats wealthy delinquent taxpayers with kid gloves.
“If we want people to work and pay off tax debt, we can’t take their driver’s license in the meantime,” said Jeff Gentes, a lawyer with the Connecticut Fair Housing Center specializing in fair lending and foreclosure issues. “It’s an abuse of government power.”
Violette Haldane, executive director of Advocacy to Legacy, a Hartford nonprofit that teaches youth leadership and civic engagement, said the bill pending before the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee is “very punitive.
“And to take away someone’s driver’s license [when] that has nothing to do with driving, nothing to do with safety, just seems so wrong.”
The bill raised by the committee is designed to whittle down state government’s estimated $3 billion tax gap — the margin between what it’s owed and what it currently collects.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration reported the 2022 tax gap in January as directed by the legislature. It also notified legislators that the Department of Revenue Services is facing a real challenge in resources.
DRS Commissioner Mark Boughton said the department is seeking authorization to hire attorneys to help with collections from delinquent taxpayers who have left Connecticut. Boughton said the state faces “thousands of thousands” of cases like this, with an aggregate outstanding debt of about $258 million.
But critics note the committee’s bill is much broader in scope than the tax department’s current request.
First, it authorizes DRS to contract with collection agencies as well as with lawyers. Second, they can use these to pursue delinquents residing both in and out of Connecticut.
Legislators balked three years ago when the Lamont administration sought permission to sell delinquent tax debt to private collection agencies.
The Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent office within the IRS, classified privatized collections as one of the IRS’ “most serious problems” in its 2017 report to Congress.
About 44% of all taxpayers targeted by private collection agencies on behalf of the IRS “are at risk of economic hardship,” according to the report. And the median income of households targeted by collection agencies that later entered into installment agreements to repay their debt was $38,021 per year.
“With unacceptable frequency,” the Taxpayer Advocate Service added, “taxpayers whose debts are assigned to PCAs [private collection agencies] are placed in installment agreements they cannot afford.”
Critics also noted that while Connecticut continues to explore using collection agencies that target poor households, its history with wealthy tax delinquents is marked by extreme patience.
The state offered seven tax amnesty programs — a benefit typically used by households and businesses that can afford specialized legal counsel or accounting services — between 1990 and 2021. That means once every 4.6 years, on average, the state waives certain penalties on overdue filers to enhance revenue collections.
Besides raising the issue of collection agencies, the new legislation also stipulates that once a filer’s tax payment is overdue for 30 days, the state would notify that person that in another 60 days, the delinquent status would be reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
The license wouldn’t be suspended. But unless the taxpayer successfully appeals the matter, the DMV “shall not issue or renew” that person’s license or vehicle registration until delinquent taxes, including interest and other penalties, have been paid.
Gentes, who also supervises a clinic at Yale Law School, said that provision — like the option to employ collection agencies — is designed chiefly to intimidate low-income residents who lack the resources to overcome a temporary loss of transportation.
“We should not be using government to punish poor people,” he added.
The committee drafted the measure largely in response to the administration’s tax gap report. But, according to that report, most of Connecticut’s tax gap isn’t tied to the low-income households that, critics say, the bill would target the most.
According to that analysis, nearly 80% of Connecticut’s uncollected taxes involve under-reporting of income, a problem typically connected with businesses and households that can afford tax attorneys and accountants. 
Another 14% involves filers who don’t pay the full amount they claim to owe, and 6% involves those who don’t file altogether.
Complicating matters, the department’s contingent of auditors, who are essential to targeting underreporting, has been shrinking for more than a decade, according to the tax gap report.
DRS had 228 auditor positions this fiscal year, down 20% since 2012 and 11% since Lamont became governor six years ago.
Boughton said most states audit 3% of tax returns each year. Connecticut audits less than 1%.
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the Democratic-controlled committee, said the measure remains a work in progress, adding that she and others on the panel have several concerns. The finance committee must complete action on all bills it had raised by Thursday.
Horn said while Connecticut should seek ways to recoup delinquent tax dollars, particularly from taxpayers who leave the state, it cannot craft a system that targets one income group. She added that the need for more auditors to tackle the largest portion of the tax gap also must be addressed.
“I do believe DRS is understaffed,” she said.
Rep. Joe Polletta of Watertown, ranking House Republican on the finance panel, said he also wants lawmakers to make a serious effort to reduce tax delinquency — but in a fair manner across all income groups.
“If you owe a single dollar to the state of Connecticut, you should pay in a timely manner,” he said. “No one should get preferential treatment.”
But Polletta said he thinks withholding driver’s licenses for tax reasons only will make it harder for many households to pay what they owe. And he noted DMV Commissioner Antonio Guerrera testified before the committee that administering the withholding of driver’s licenses and vehicle registrations would be a burden on the agency and should be stripped from the bill.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_071-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 08:01:30.211429

(Getty Images)There are some big opinions on the overall impact of the property tax bill that lawmakers passed and Gov. Mike Braun celebrated. I don’t think it’s either as good or as bad as some believe — but today, I want to focus on some smaller provisions that deserve notice.
They aren’t sexy, like a $300 homeowner credit or a business personal property tax cut. But they do make a difference.
The first is a bond debt cooling-off period.
Under current law, when a local unit of government is planning to bond for a new project, it’ll often do it when another bond is set to expire. That means local officials can tell taxpayers they won’t see an increase in their tax bill. That is technically true, but they also won’t see a decrease.
Senate Enrolled Act 1 requires a one-year freeze after a bond expires so that taxpayers see the reduction.
Indiana Senate sends finalized local property, income tax plan to governor

Another change is moving all referenda votes to the general election. Schools use referenda largely for construction projects but can also hold them for school security and operational needs if they feel the state hasn’t provided what they need.
Of course, they still have to convince taxpayers to fund those needs.
For years, these votes were allowed in primary elections, when fewer Hoosiers go to the polls. Lawmakers believe moving them to general elections gives more transparency to the costs that lie above the percent caps for bills.
According to data collected by the Indiana School Boards Association, the school referendum pass rate in Indiana is 16 percentage points higher at the primary election than at the general election. The organization believes this is because primary voters are better informed and highly motivated to vote for or against the referendum. But voters in the general election are often surprised by the referendum and reflexively vote no.
Several provisions in the new law require affirmative voting on taxes, which can only be a good thing.
One section says if a unit’s assessed value remains the same, its levy cannot exceed the year before unless its fiscal body votes to do so by ordinance following a separate public hearing. Also, if assessed value does grow, it requires a decrease in the tax rate to bring in the same amount of money unless it’s affirmatively raised.
This language is meant to draw attention to the automatic nature of property taxes, which are essentially a calculation involving tax rate and assessed value.
Similarly, local income taxes — which got a lot of attention in discussion over the property tax package — will revert to zero each year. This forces an annual vote by fiscal leaders of local government to continue collecting that money.
I’m not actually sure this is necessary, and I can’t imagine state lawmakers would want to vote on the state income or sales tax every single year. But it is consistent with other moves to make the overall taxation system more open and understandable.
In the weeds
The last bits of language I want to highlight are deep in the weeds of property taxes.
The maximum levy growth quotient currently limits how much local property tax levies can rise in a year based on a six-year rolling average of non-farm personal income growth. Because of inflation, it rose to 5% in 2023 compared to 3.4% in 2019. Lawmakers last year put in an artificial cap of 4% and Senate Enrolled Act 1 extends that another year.
The bill also limits excess levy appeals by units. In that past, cities, counties and other units were allowed to ask for more revenue based on certain circumstances, such as assessed value growth and school transportation costs. Those won’t be allowed any longer, though an appeal would still be an option in case of natural disaster or other emergency.
None of these items individually — or even collectively — will likely drop your tax obligation in any massive way. But they do create a more responsive and open system so that Hoosiers can more easily understand the decisions that are being made. It also puts local officials on the hot seat instead of state lawmakers.
“They’re waving a flag, saying we’re the ones cutting your taxes … when what they’re doing is shifting everything on to the local government and saying, ‘You be the bad guys,’” Sen. Ron Alting told Based in Lafayette.
He was one of 12 Republicans to vote against the bill. Some believe it didn’t go far enough to cut property taxes.
In the end, those who simply disagree with the mechanism of property taxes will never be pleased with what occurred. But from a pragmatic standpoint, this package was more than I thought Gov. Mike Braun could get.

(Photo by Veronica Gabriela Cardenas, Pool/Getty Images)The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.






During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation, and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director for public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
 ‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’

Private immigration detention dates to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corp. of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.


Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada, and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, although those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.
Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county, and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting, and food safety.
State inspectors would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.










They're incentivized to cut corners.


– Setareh Ghandehari, Detention Watch Network’s advocacy director


CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.

In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio, and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
 Troubling conditions

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.

State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The University of Minnesota, where a graduate student was detained and stripped of his student visa late last month, is the country’s only university actively contracted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, having leased its gun range to the agency since 2022 according to public federal spending data. 
A Minnesota Reformer analysis of ICE contracts also found that a gun range jointly owned by the cities of Cottage Grove and Woodbury holds one of the largest contracts for gun range leasing to ICE in the country, while a manufacturer in Anoka, Minn. provides more ammunition to the agency than any other contractor. 
Overall, contractors in Minnesota receive less in ICE contracts than those in states like Virginia and Texas, which each have had over $400 million in contracts since Jan. 2024, compared to Minnesota’s $7 million. Still, the data shows the two ways that Minnesota stands out: in producing ammunition and leasing gun range facilities to the agency. 
The findings come at a time when the Trump administration has been actively ramping up its immigration enforcement tactics, which have included a flurry of executive actions and what legal experts deem a legally questionable expansion of ICE’s reach. Immigration enforcement is becoming notably more aggressive in higher education, with hundreds of foreign students, including five from Minnesota State-Mankato, getting their visas revoked in recent days. Students and faculty nationwide have responded with protests against ICE, including at the University of Minnesota, where the existence of the gun range contract seems largely unknown. 
University of Minnesota leases gun range, making it ICE’s only existing contract with a university
The University of Minnesota has received $17,395 since 2022 to lease its Rosemount gun range to federal immigration enforcement for training, according to the spending data. The currently active contract, which ends in May, amounts to $18,867 to be paid over twelve months. 
Apprehension around immigration enforcement is high at the university, where Turkish graduate student Doğukan Günaydin was arrested and stripped of his student visa on March 27 for a 2023 drunken driving conviction, the New York Times reported. University president Rebecca Cunningham called the arrest, whose reasons were initially unknown, “deeply concerning” in a statement the day after. Elected officials quickly responded on social media, and activists organized a protest in downtown Minneapolis. 
In an email, university spokesperson Jake Ricker confirmed that the campus police department manages a firearm range on university property, which ICE, along with other law enforcement agencies, has reserved and used “for several years.” 
“As a public university, decisions about reviewing space requests” are required to be made “in a viewpoint neutral manner,” Ricker added. 
The last time another educational institution received contracts from ICE was when the Vermont State Colleges provided leadership training to the agency in 2023, according to the spending data. Johns Hopkins previously received over $1 million in ICE contracts, which, after a year of campus protests, were ended in September 2019 — though the school has since signed contracts with Customs and Border Protection, according to a Mother Jones report. 
The larger University of Minnesota community seems unaware of the agreement. Luisa Gaona, president of the university’s chapter of Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social, an organization that helped circulate a petition to support immigrants and non-citizens on campus, said she was surprised to hear about the contract. 
“I just don’t know why the university is collaborating,” Gaona said. “I don’t see the point there.” 
Gaona said that the contract will likely diminish trust in campus police among already-wary students. 
In her statement, university president Cunningham noted that campus departments “do not enforce federal immigration laws, and our officers do not inquire about an individual’s immigration status.” 
“Their focus remains on public safety, fostering trust and maintaining strong relationships across the University community,” Cunningham wrote. 
Still, Ricker previously told the campus newspaper that the university “cannot ignore federal court orders or subpoenas.” 
The Trump administration has rescinded prior protections from immigration enforcement in schools and is detaining international students with no charges. ICE had largely been targeting students who have expressed criticism of U.S. support of Israel in the Israel-Gaza war. The decision to arrest and jail Günaydin for an old DWI signals a worrying expansion of ICE’s authority, according to immigration lawyers. 


Twenty miles away from the university gun range is HERO Center and Shooting Range, a gun range jointly owned by Cottage Grove and Woodbury, Minn., that has received over $290k in contract payments from ICE since 2020, according to Cottage Grove spokesperson Phil Jents. 
That’s the second highest of active agreements ICE has with gun ranges, according to the spending database. In February alone, ICE spent $5,292 using the facility, Jents said. 
In other cities, contracts with ICE to use local training facilities have been controversial. In September 2019, Portland, Ore., police terminated a two-year contract to lease its training facility to immigration enforcement following criticism. 
Minnesota leads in ammunition manufacturing for ICE
Minnesota is also the top producer of rifle ammunition for immigration enforcement, with over $28 million in contracts since 2020. That number is driven largely by the Kinetic Group, formerly Vista Outdoors, a Czech-owned ammunition manufacturer based in Anoka, Minn. with over $6 million in active contracts with ICE. 

A 2023 press release confirms that one of the company’s brands received a contract from the Department of Homeland Security for ammunition “made exclusively for law enforcement and at our Anoka, MN headquarters,” though the press release did not give a dollar amount. 
The company’s most recent contract was signed in February for over $500k of ammunition and lists the principal place of performance as Fort Benning, Ga., a U.S. Army post where, as of 2019, ICE had plans to build a “hyper realistic” urban combat training facility modeled after a city in Arizona.

It’s just one of the 273 notifications the average teen receives daily, according to Common Sense Media.
Her focus fades and learning stalls. A United Nations study found that it can take up to 20 minutes to regain concentration after such an interruption—making the cost of distraction cumulative, not momentary.
Students spend an average of 43 minutes on their phones each school day—nearly a full class period. Over the course of a school year, that equals roughly 130 hours of missed instruction. Missouri students cannot afford these losses, especially when more than a third of the state’s fourth- and eighth-graders score below basic proficiency in reading, with similar concerns in math, as reported by the National Assessment of Educational Progress.
Research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development shows that even the mere presence of a phone—or being seated near one—can negatively impact academic performance, particularly in math. A recent survey found that 53% of school leaders believe phones harm academic progress, while 73% report they diminish students’ attention spans. This distraction doesn’t just affect individual students; it erodes focus throughout the entire classroom.
Several St. Louis-area districts have adopted stricter cellphone bans after previous attempts failed to curb phone use in class. These early successes offer a practical roadmap for schools statewide, proving that focused classroom environments are possible with clear phone policies.
If we are serious about raising achievement and closing learning gaps, we must prioritize focus—beginning with limiting phone use during class.
The February 2025 SLU/YouGov Poll found that 70% of likely Missouri voters support banning phones during class across all K-12 schools. Nationally, 53% of adults favor similar restrictions for middle and high schoolers, and 83% of National Education Association members back a full school-day phone ban. Teachers, parents, researchers, and voters are all aligned in this rare moment of consensus on the need for change.
School safety bill advances in Missouri House with restrictions on cell phone use

Banning phones promotes equity by addressing the digital divide. Not every student has access to the latest devices, and phone use in class can exacerbate inequalities. Students with ADHD, learning differences, or trauma histories are especially vulnerable to digital distraction. Well-defined policies level the playing field, fostering more focused, inclusive classrooms.
Some families raise safety concerns, particularly in light of school shootings. However, experts recommend structured communication systems—not student cell phones. In a crisis, phones can spread misinformation, jam emergency lines, and prevent students from hearing or following safety instructions.
The Missouri House recently advanced a school safety bill that includes provisions for limiting cellphone use, reflecting ongoing discussions on how to address distractions in schools. This bill is one approach among many that seek to balance safety and learning environments, and it has garnered significant attention for its potential to create clear, student-centered policies.
While some schools have implemented phone restrictions, the lack of a statewide policy creates inequities for students, families, and teachers. A consistent framework at the state level would ensure that all schools, regardless of where they live, can create environments that support learning.
Schools don’t need to start from scratch. Many districts already use effective tools like wall-mounted phone caddies, magnetically sealed pouches, or classroom tech agreements. The goal is to create classroom norms that promote learning. With clear guidance and local flexibility, districts can implement practical, age-appropriate policies supported by staff and families.
Missouri wouldn’t be going it alone. Currently, at least 19 states have laws or policies banning or restricting cellphone use in schools or recommending local districts adopt similar measures, according to an Education Week analysis. Additionally, another 16 states have introduced similar legislation this year.
The issue of cellphone use in classrooms is complex. Finding the right balance between reducing distractions and supporting students’ needs will require thoughtful, evidence-based decisions. The stakes are high for student engagement and success, and thoughtful, evidence-based decisions will be key to shaping effective policies moving forward.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/teacher-in-a-classroom-1536x864-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-18 08:01:30.211429

Facing the continued collapse of Chinook salmon, officials this week shut down California’s commercial salmon fishing season for an unprecedented third year in a row.
Under the decision by an interstate fisheries agency, recreational salmon fishing will be allowed in California for only brief windows of time this spring. This will be the first year that any sportfishing of Chinook has been allowed since 2022.
The decision by the Pacific Fishery Management Council means that no salmon caught off California can be sold to retail consumers and restaurants for at least another year. In Oregon and Washington, commercial salmon fishing will remain open, although limited.
“From a salmon standpoint, it’s an environmental disaster. For the fishing industry, it’s a human tragedy, and it’s also an economic disaster,” said Scott Artis, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Association, an industry organization that has lobbied for river restoration and improved hatchery programs.
The decline of California’s salmon follows decades of deteriorating conditions in the waterways where the fish spawn each year, including the Sacramento and Klamath rivers.
California’s salmon are an ecological icon and a valued source of food for Native American tribes. The shutdown also has an economic toll: It has already put hundreds of commercial fishers and sportfishing boat operators out of work and affected thousands of people in communities and industries reliant on processing, selling and serving locally caught salmon.
California’s commercial fishery has never been closed for three years in a row before.
Some experts fear the conditions in California have been so poor for so long that Chinook may never rebound to fishable levels. Others remain hopeful for major recovery if the amounts of water diverted to farms and cities are reduced and wetlands kept dry by flood-control levees are restored.

 
This year’s recreational season includes several brief windows for fishing, including a weekend in June and another in July, or a quota of 7,000 fish.
Jared Davis, owner and operator of the Salty Lady in Sausalito, one of dozens of party boats that take paying customers fishing, thinks it’s likely that this quota will be met on the first open weekend for recreational fishing, scheduled for June 7-8.
“Obviously, the pressure is going to be intense, so everybody and their mother is going to be out on the water on those days,” he said. “When they hit that quota, it’s done.”
One member of the fishery council, Corey Ridings, voted against the proposed regulations after saying she was concerned that the first weekend would overshoot the 7,000-fish quota.
Davis said such a miniscule recreational season won’t help boat owners like him recover from past closures, though it will carry symbolic meaning.
“It might give California anglers a glimmer of hope and keep them from selling all their rods and buying golf clubs,” he said.
Sarah Bates, a commercial fisher based at San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf, said the ongoing closure has stripped many boat owners of most of their income.
“It continues to be devastating,” she said. “Salmon has been the cornerstone of many of our ports for a long time.”
She said the shutdown also has trickle-down effects on a range of businesses that support the salmon fishery, such as fuel services, grocery stores and dockside ice machines.
“We’re also seeing a sort of a third wave … the general seafood market for local products has tanked,” such as rockfish and halibut. She said that many buyers are turning to farmed and wild salmon delivered from other regions instead.
Davis noted that federal emergency relief funds promised for the 2023 closure still have not arrived. “Nobody has seen a dime,” he said.
 Fewer returning salmon

Before the Gold Rush, several million Chinook spawned annually in the river systems of the Central Valley and the state’s northern coast. Through much of the 20th century, California’s salmon fishery formed the economic backbone of coastal fishing ports, with fishers using hook and line pulling in millions of pounds in good years.
But in 2024, just 99,274 fall-run Chinook — the most commercially viable of the Central Valley’s four subpopulations — returned to the Sacramento River and its tributaries, substantially lower than the numbers in 2023. In 2022, fewer than 70,000 returned, one of the lowest estimates ever.

 
About 40,000 returned to the San Joaquin River. Fewer than 30,000 Chinook reached their spawning grounds in the Klamath River system, where the Hoopa, Yurok and Karuk tribes rely on the fish in years of abundance.
The decline of California’s salmon stems from nearly two centuries of damage inflicted on the rivers where salmon spend the first and final stages of their lives. Gold mining, logging and dam construction devastated watersheds. Levees constrained rivers, turning them into relatively sterile channels of fast-moving water while converting floodplains and wetlands into irrigated farmland.
Today, many of these impacts persist, along with water diversions, reduced flows and elevated river temperatures that frequently spell death for fertilized eggs and juvenile fish.
 The future of California salmon is murky

Peter Moyle, a UC Davis fish biologist and professor emeritus, said recovery of self-sustaining populations may be possible in some tributaries of the Sacramento River.
“There are some opportunities for at least keeping runs going in parts of the Central Valley, but getting naturally spawning fish back in large numbers, I just can’t see it happening,” he said.
Jacob Katz, a biologist with the group California Trout, holds out hope for a future of flourishing Sacramento River Chinook. “We could have vibrant fall-run populations in a decade,” he said.
That will require major habitat restoration involving dam removals, reconstruction of levee systems to revive wetlands and floodplains, and reduced water diversions for agriculture — all measures fraught with cost, regulatory constraints, and controversy.
State officials, recognizing the risk of extinction, have promoted salmon recovery as a policy goal for years. In early 2024, the Newsom administration released its California Salmon Strategy for a Hotter, Drier Future, a 37-page catalogue of proposed actions to mitigate environmental impacts and restore flows and habitat, all in the face of climate change.
California Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Charlton H. Bonham said the decision to allow limited recreational fishing “brings hope. We know, however, that this news brings little relief” to the industry.
He said salmon “are still recovering from severe drought and other climate challenges and have not yet benefitted from our consecutive years of wet winters and other actions taken to boost populations.”
However, Artis of Golden State Salmon Association said while the state’s salmon strategy includes some important items, it leaves out equally critical steps, such as protecting minimum flows for fish. He said salmon are threatened by proposed water projects endorsed by the Newsom administration.
“It fails to include some of the upcoming salmon-killing projects that the governor is pushing like Sites Reservoir and the Delta tunnel, and it ignores the fact that the Voluntary Agreements are designed to allow massive diversions of water,” he said.
Experts agree that an important key to rebuilding salmon runs is increasing the frequency and duration of shallow flooding in riverside riparian areas, or even fallow rice paddies — a program Katz has helped develop through his career.
On such seasonal floodplains, a shallow layer of water can help trigger an explosion of photosynthesis and food production, ultimately providing nutrition for juvenile salmon as they migrate out of the river system each spring.
Through meetings with farmers, urban water agencies and government officials, Rene Henery, California science director with Trout Unlimited, has helped draft an ambitious salmon recovery plan dubbed “Reorienting to Recovery.” Featuring habitat restoration, carefully managed harvests and generously enhanced river flows — especially in dry years — this framework, Henery said, could rebuild diminished Central Valley Chinook runs to more than 1.6 million adult fish per year over a 20-year period.
He said adversaries — often farmers and environmentalists — must shift from traditional feuds over water to more collaborative programs of restoring productive watersheds while maintaining productive agriculture.
As the recovery needle for Chinook moves in the wrong direction, Katz said deliberate action is urgent.
“We’re balanced on the edge of losing these populations,” he said. “We have to go big now. We have no other option.”

Mike Braun is all that remains for a Medicaid work requirements bill to become law, though such a move would require federal approval before it could go into effect.
Under Senate Bill 2, Hoosiers getting their health insurance under the Healthy Indiana Plan would need to log at least 20 work or volunteer hours a week with the overseeing state agency, a move that supporters hope will curb the program’s enrollment numbers. 
“I’d like to remind everybody who Medicaid is for: it is for our poor and our disabled. So every dollar … that is being redirected to somebody who should not be eligible, is taking a dollar away from somebody — some Hoosier — who is poor and or disabled,” said Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown. 
  Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, pushes back against Senate Bill 2 on April 17, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Every other member of the voting Republican caucus agreed: moving the bill forward on a 37-10 vote.
The program, otherwise known as HIP, covers working-age Hoosiers with low-to-moderate incomes and has been in place — in some form or another — since former Gov. Mitch Daniels’ administration. 
But Democrats decried the move, countering the belief that it would decrease costs. Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, pointed to a provision that quadruples eligibility checks from an annual process to a quarterly effort.
“My concern is Senate Bill 2 will eventually continue to drive up the costs of administering Indiana’s Medicaid program. So while we’re trying to save money, the way the language sits now … will drive up costs, administrative costs, bureaucracy,” said Yoder. “… Making Indiana’s Medicaid program more complicated will only increase the likelihood of eligible Medicaid members losing their coverage.” 
She also worried that the proposal would have a ripple effect on greater health care access across the state, such as the closure of clinics and longer emergency department waits.
Breaking down budgets: Why Medicaid expenses are growing

Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, said his daughter accessed disability services under a Medicaid waiver. 
“You’ll find that those of us that rely on Medicaid are also the most defensive of Medicaid and making sure that those folks that are on the program are eligible … and are being served appropriately,” said Bohacek. “… the path that we’re going on now, it will make the entire program untenable. And this program is way too important for those that quality.”
The Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimate that imposing Medicaid work requirements could cull between 102,000-116,000 Hoosiers from the expansion population rolls, far short of the more than 250,000 who would have to be cut in order to meet the 500,000 cap suggested in an earlier version of the bill. 
Though the bill no longer includes an explicit numerical cap, the language allows the Family and Social Services Administration to limit enrollment based on funding, which Sen. Fady Qaddoura called an “appropriation cap.”
“I see this as a policy goal of capping Medicaid enrollment based on appropriations,” said the Indianapolis Democrat. “… there are other solutions. The solution is not to reduce eligibility. The solution is not to reduce appropriations.”
 Details

Republicans point to the bill as a way to save much-needed money going into the next two-year budget cycle — though the Healthy Indiana Plan isn’t funded by state dollars. Instead, the federal government pays for 90% of the insurance program while provider and cigarette taxes cover the remainder. 
Several patient and anti-poverty advocates rallied earlier this month to oppose the restrictions proposed under Senate Bill 2, including the Indiana chapter of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. 
Lucy Dagneau, a senior director overseeing the organization’s national Medicaid campaigns, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that work requirements, specifically, can have a detrimental impact on those with cancer. Such constraints can “impose additional barriers to care and paperwork between cancer patients and their doctors,” Dagneau said.
“I think in a state like Indiana, it seems so unfortunate that the state would take steps backward when the Healthy Indiana Plan has been so successful and such a lifeline for people with cancer and a support in the lives of people who could be diagnosed with cancer,” said Dagneau.

According to ACS CAN, Medicaid covers the care of an estimated one in ten adults with a history of cancer and one in three children diagnosed with cancer.
“ACS has done a number of studies that show that Medicaid expansion specifically improves cancer survival rates. It reduces cancer mortality (and) it increases the likelihood that cancer patients receive timely treatment and an earlier stage diagnosis,” Dagneau said. “Pretty much across the cancer care continuum, Medicaid expansion makes dealing with cancer, preventing cancer and treating cancer better.”
Though listed exemptions to the bill’s work requirements would likely include someone diagnosed with cancer, “qualifying for and maintaining an exemption can be confusing and onerous,” according to ACS CAN. 
The biggest driver of Medicaid costs is Indiana’s aging population, many of whom rely on it to pay for nursing homes, assisted living facilities, home health aides and other long-term care costs. 
Senate Bill 2 also includes language that would assess the so-called “lookback period,” where regulators assess an individual’s financial assets before determining their Medicaid eligibility. 
“That’s actually how wealthy people get on Medicaid … you can sign all your assets over to a family member and then you have to wait five years and then you go on Medicaid,” said Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka. “We’re just not sure that they’re really waiting five years and we just wanted to … report on what they’re doing to claw back from those violators.”
However, like with the Medicaid work requirements and increased administrative workload, such a provision would need federal approval.

The hope is that creating an alliance between the 14 universities in the Big Ten Conference to defend “academic freedom, institutional integrity, and the research enterprise,” as the resolution reads, will make schools stronger together.
Just this week, the faculty senate at fellow Big Ten school Michigan State University adopted such a resolution, as have Indiana University and the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.

Schools are already seeing the negative impacts of President Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric and threatening executive orders, Sandra Levitsky, a professor of sociology and law at the University of Michigan said Thursday during the faculty senate meeting. The university’s administration quickly folded to Trump’s demands to shut down diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies, shuttering the doors of the school’s DEI office, Levitsky said.
“The University of Michigan abandoned DEI in-part to avoid the wrath of Trump and most schools, not just ours, have been cowed into this kind of preemptive capitulation. Most schools, not just ours, have gone silent, just when we need them to speak up,” Levisky said. “Hoping that our university is going to step out of this defensive crouch is not going to be enough, because the reality is, this is an existential moment for higher education and most schools, not just ours, are genuinely terrified about what might happen next.”
U-M-Motion-to-establish-alliance
 
The United States is on the cusp of an authoritarian administration, Associate Professor of History and Gender Studies Yi-Li Wu said during the faculty senate meeting, and everyone must look themselves in the mirror and determine what they will do as democratic institutions like higher education are attacked.
And silence or eager compliance are not survival strategies, Wu said, noting that Columbia University, which has had hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding pulled and several Pro-Palestinian students arrested, is a prime example of the reality that compromising on core values will not save schools from Trump’s wrath.
In reflecting on U of M’s smothering of the DEI office, Wu said it would appear the administration is trying to play a quiet game to stay out of the spotlight, but it won’t work.
“They apparently think that the best course is to work behind the scenes with lobbyists and to avoid making any public noise that might draw attention to us. They apparently think that ‘do it to the other guy, not us’, is a viable strategy for survival,” Wu said. “But we have seen that complying and silence do not work.”
The university’s faculty senate will have until Sunday to vote on whether to adopt the resolution.
The resolution is a “mutual suicide pact”, physics professor Keith Riles said, urging his colleagues to vote against the the Mutual Defense Compact Thursday.
It’s important to choose battles and allies wisely, Riles said, and after years of the university disregarding anti-discrimination laws, faculty members have “provoked the understandable anger of voters for whom Donald Trump is a vehicle for retribution.”
“Many of you have deluded yourselves into thinking that discrimination against whites and Asian Americans, especially males, is somehow magically permissible,” Riles said. “The Trump administration is, yes, it’s attacking this university, I understand that, but the university has much to answer for…You brought this on all of us.”
Though the Thursday meeting of the faculty senate was in large part called in response to the university’s recent decisions on DEI policies, Fred Terry, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science, said the stakes are much higher and broader.
What the Trump administration has set into motion is a regime where any research area, public discourse or curriculum that the president disagrees with will be gutted, with universities risking severe consequences if they don’t give in to Trump’s wishes, Terry said. This defies academic freedom and defiles the university’s mission to serve the state and the world through research and cultivating citizens for the betterment of the future.
But that doesn’t mean that banding together will protect schools, Terry said, but the cost of not trying presents a greater danger.
“I do have to observe that with a unified effort, we may not win, particularly in the near term. This is not a low stakes game. There may be real suffering by many in our community. We cannot engage in this fight lightly, but we cannot give up without giving up our intellectual integrity. Measures like motion one are clearly our best hope,” Terry said.
Following the faculty senate meeting, Democratic elected officials gathered at the Diag on the Ann Arbor campus to rail against the Trump administration cancelling student visas in recent weeks at schools across the country, including U of M and MSU.
It’s two weeks until graduation at plenty of Michigan schools, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) told a small crowd at the Diag Thursday, and Democrats in Congress are demanding answers about why this crackdown on visas is happening just before students are about to have their hard work rewarded on the graduation stage.

“I’m here to make this promise to all of you. We are demanding answers. No one will silence my voice. Do not let them silence yours,” Dingell told students on campus, affirming the crowd that diverse students and diverse perspectives are what makes campuses and the dialogues that can happen richer.
After announcing his campaign Thursday morning for the 2026 race for the open U.S. Senate seat to represent Michigan, Democrat Abdul El-Sayed joined the rally on campus to encourage students to “fight back” against Trump’s fear tactics.
Trump’s policies prey on people’s pain, El-Sayed said. By coercing his followers into cynicism about the economy and creating divisions between people groups, El-Sayed said Trump has won back the White House where he is implementing policies that will help his billionaire friends like Elon Musk, while leaving the middle class worse off than before.
“If we’re not willing to protect our democracy, if we’re not willing to go back to back working with one another to protect what it means to be an American, the question we have to ask ourselves is, ‘who will’,” El-Sayed said.

While Trump has used his power to pardon January 6 protestors who vandalized the U.S. Capitol and assaulted law enforcement in support of him in 2021, he’s calling for the arrest and deportation of students who speak out against his policies, U of M Junior and member of the College Democrats group Amber Henson said.
The First Amendment rights of students are on the line, and as college campuses have long been the stage of social movements throughout American history, threats to these rights must be answered, Henson said.
Leading up to Thursday, as the U of M College Democrats were organizing the rally, Henson said there was one student in the group who was concerned that their visa status would be revoked if they attended. As the daughter of Polish immigrants and as an International Studies student, the pull to protect international students and speak against federal acts to attack them is strong.
Young people have a lot to lose right now for speaking out, Henson said, but they also have a lot to gain as they face what decades of ramifications of this current administration could mean for their lives.

Phil Murphy says ""market manipulation"" is behind rising energy costs. Critics say Murphy's focus on offshore wind is to blame. (Amalie Hindash for New Jersey Monitor)The fight between New Jersey Democrats and the state’s electric grid operator escalated this week, with Murphy asking federal officials to investigate whether the company is responsible for the “exorbitant” rate increases set to take effect in less than two months. 
In a Wednesday letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Murphy asked officials to probe whether grid operator PJM Interconnection’s most recent electricity auction may have been “subject to market manipulation” that will result in ratepayers’ bills increasing by hundreds of dollars a year beginning June 1. 
“I believe that billions of dollars in excessive costs for consumers are the direct result of fundamental flaws in PJM’s capacity market and were foreseeable and preventable,” Murphy wrote. 
PJM operates the grid for New Jersey and 12 other states. The company held a rate-setting capacity auction last July — in New Jersey, utilities annually buy electricity supply through auctions — and the state Board of Public Utilities has blamed the auction as the “main driver of these increases.” The board announced in February it approved the new rates, resulting in increases of about 17% to 20%, depending on the service territory. 
Democrats are anxious over the skyrocketing costs, which will kick in days before voters cast their ballots in the June 10 primary, when all 80 Assembly seats and the governor’s race will be on the ballot. Lawmakers have introduced a seven-bill package they say is intended to lower costs for consumers, including bills that would set new processes to determine a utility company’s profit margins and end a surcharge tacked onto monthly bills. 
In a statement, PJM officials blamed the price hikes on “insufficient generation in-state” and denied any market manipulation in the auction. PJM echoed complaints of New Jersey Republicans who say Murphy’s focus on offshore wind projects has resulted in energy supply issues.
“Consumers are now paying the price for this failure,” said Jeff Shields, PJM spokesman. 
During a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting Thursday, commission chairman Mark Christie praised PJM and said politicians have been too critical of PJM. The company is “actually deserving of praise,” Christie said.
“I think is in many ways misplaced and lot of it is because of state policies that have sort of come to a head just recently. So I just want to say that with regard to defending PJM and defending their staff who work very hard, and work in good faith, by the way,” Christie said. “I never doubted PJM’s good faith.”
Another commissioner, Willie Phillips, said that those comments were “spot on and very well said.”
Christie said during a press conference that while he hadn’t seen Murphy’s recent letter, he’s seen his complaints, adding “a lot of these problems are some 20 years in the making, and I think a lot of it is just the very construct of a mandatory capacity market.” 
State Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris) has argued that the state’s energy policies under Murphy have led to supply-demand imbalances, and this, rather than market manipulation or anything PJM did, caused electricity prices to soar.
“You can’t increase demand to the point where the state can’t meet it, and they don’t have the supply to meet it. When you do that, it’s purely economics,” Bucco told the New Jersey Monitor. “Prices go up, and now our residents are going to be faced with that.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_1729_1-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-04-18 07:00:17.247106

Amid a bipartisan push to improve school safety and students’ mental health, Republican lawmakers have put forward a package of bills that aims to create a comprehensive “school-community mental health system” and put additional crisis teams in schools.
The bill package cleared a legislative hurdle on Wednesday when the House Education and Workforce Committee voted to move it forward.
Last year, the legislature passed several bipartisan school safety bills that were introduced after a student shot and killed four students at Oxford High School in 2021. Those measures took lawmakers more than three years to approve, in part, because Democrats wanted to include gun reforms in proposed measures, and Republicans wanted to leave those measures out. A bipartisan House of Representatives school safety task force also researched the issues and interviewed school and public safety officials, community members, and survivors of school shootings, including Oxford, and their families.
Democrats eventually altered their proposals to gain support from Republicans.
Some of the newly introduced Republican bills touch on areas the original school safety task force agreed would be priorities: physical security, mental health, data processes, staff, and education. The bills do not address firearms and criminal justice, which were also among the original goals of the task force.
Rep. Kelly Breen, a Democrat from Novi, said in a March 26 hearing for the bills she was “alarmed” that the legwork the taskforce did and the input from school and public safety officials was not reflected in the new Republican bills. For example, Breen said the bills require hiring of hundreds of new mental health staff while schools already struggle to fill open positions.
One of the bills that moved forward this week would require every intermediate school district — or regional agencies that work with the Michigan Department of Education and local school districts to develop programs and meet goals — in Michigan to hire a mental health coordinator to develop and implement the comprehensive system. It would integrate community or faith-based mental health services in public and private schools. Few details about how this would play out in schools were available.
With state funds, the coordinator would also facilitate and deploy a behavioral health care technology platform for schools, as well as oversee and monitor Medicaid billing and the Caring 4 Students program, which partially reimburses school districts for mental health services for students who are eligible for Medicaid.
The bill would also require each ISD to have at least one emergency and safety manager to serve as a liaison between state and local school and law enforcement entities. The manager would perform risk assessments, facilitate response training with schools, and implement prevention programs.
It could cost an estimated $16.8 million in state funding for every ISD in the state to add the staff, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill. Schools would not have to meet the requirements if the state does not allocate the money to fund the positions, according to the bill.
The House Education and Workforce Committee voted to move the bill forward during a meeting Wednesday.
Republican state Reps. Nancy DeBoer, Rylee Linting, Joseph Fox, Tom Kunse, Joseph Pavlov, and Alicia St. Germain voted in favor of moving the bill to a vote in the full House. Democratic state Reps. Matt Koleszar and Regina Weiss voted against it.
Democratic state Reps. Jimmie Wilson Jr. and Erin Byrnes abstained, as did Republican state Rep. Brad Paquette.
 Here’s what the other new Republican proposals would do


Require every public school to establish its own crisis team by July 1, 2026. The team would be responsible for initiating lockdowns, helping evacuate students and staff, as well as reuniting families after a safety crisis. The teams would include the school’s principal, vice principal, a school resource officer, and other school personnel. Private schools would have to establish an emergency operations plan.
Change the requirement for public schools to review their emergency preparedness plans with local law enforcement from every two years to every three years. Private schools, which currently are not required to share their plans, would also have to adhere to the requirement.
Local schools that don’t currently have temporary locking systems – or systems that immediately lock doors as a barrier in active shooter situations – would have to install them.
Increase the number of lockdown drills schools must complete each school year from three to four. At least one of the drills would have to take place during lunch, recess, or another time when students are gathered outside of classrooms. At least one would have to take place between class periods.
Require public and private school identification cards to include contact information for the OK2SAY program, which facilitates anonymous tips on potential threats to school and student safety. An existing provision that schools are not legally liable when suicide prevention numbers are not included on student IDs would be extended to situations in which schools don’t include OK2SAY information.
Require the Michigan Department of Heath and Human Services to make materials related to suicide, depression, and anxiety available to private schools that request it. Public schools can already receive such materials.
Require the Michigan State Police’s Office of School Safety to compile quarterly reports on the OK2SAY tips it receives for the School Safety and Mental Health Commission.

The bills will go forward for a full vote in the Republican-controlled House. In order to become law, they would also need to pass votes in the Democratically controlled Senate, and be signed by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Earlier this year, Whitmer signed several other school safety bills into law. Among the measures, public schools now must have behavior threat assessment and management teams.

(Photo by Althea Dotzour / UW–Madison)Federal funding cuts and national culture war politics cast a long shadow over a state legislative committee hearing Thursday as Wisconsin’s higher education leaders asked lawmakers for additional investments in the next state budget — warning that disinvestment by the state could damage  public universities’, private nonprofit schools’ and technical colleges’ ability to serve students and the state. 
Lawmakers working on the 2025-27 state budget are gathering feedback from agency heads and members of the public just as higher education institutions across the country are facing an onslaught of threats from the Trump administration. 
As Republican lawmakers on the Assembly Colleges and Universities Committee grilled Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman and other higher education leaders on their budget goals, they appeared skeptical about providing additional funding. They pointed to current levels of spending and diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which state Republicans have demanded be cut from the UW. Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, expressed concerns about federal cuts to research and recent targeting of international students whose visas have been revoked. 
Rothman defends $855 million budget request
Rothman asked lawmakers whether the state is going to let its public universities “atrophy.” If not, he said,  new investments need to be made. The UW system has requested an additional $855 million, with the support of  Gov. Tony Evers, in the upcoming budget. 
The money  would be used to keep college affordable and accessible for Wisconsinites,  invest in retaining talented staff and support innovation, Rothman said. He told lawmakers the money would help UW maintain its two-year campuses and avoid raising tuition.
“We are at a state that without additional support from the state, student successes that we are seeing across our universities are at risk,” Rothman said. He noted that the state’s investment in the system has not kept up with inflation, and the money would put Wisconsin at the median nationwide. This would be up from Wisconsin’s current position of 43rd out of 50 when it comes to state investment in public universities.
This is not the first time Rothman has testified to lawmakers about the system’s request, having addressed lawmakers on the Joint Finance Committee, which is in charge of writing the budget on April 1.
Committee Chair Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Greenville) asked Rothman where he thought the money would come from.
“That is a challenge for the Legislature… This is an investment in the future of the state. We are returning $23 for every dollar that is invested in the Universities of Wisconsin,” Rothman said, citing a number that comes from a 2018 study.
Murphy told Rothman that he was “leery” of that number.
“If we’re increasing the money to the university by $855 million, are you telling me that I can expect $20 billion?” Murphy asked.
Rothman pointed out that lawmakers and their constituents have benefited from the existence of UW schools.
“At this table, you represent districts that have 9,000 students currently in school at the Universities of Wisconsin… More than half of you have attended one of our universities and hopefully you have benefitted from that,” Rothman said.
Murphy attended UW-Fox Valley from 1972 to 1974, according to his legislative biography. The school was merged with UW-Fond du Lac and UW-Oshkosh in 2018, and is now known as UW Oshkosh-Fox Cities. That campus is set to close in June.
Trump administration threats hanging over college campuses across the nation were central to the discussion over whether lawmakers should provide universities additional state funding.
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) brought up diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at UW institutions. An audit released last week found campuses haven’t been tracking their spending on these efforts. The audit was part of Republican lawmakers’ ongoing targeting of DEI, and comes as the Trump administration has also ramped up efforts to try to eliminate diversity programs in education. 
Republican lawmakers used staff pay and capital projects funding during the last legislative cycle as a negotiating tool with the UW system to get concessions on DEI efforts, including a reduction in positions focused on DEI. 
“We’re trying to see more of an effort to see in money savings, and I know there’s been reductions in positions, but there’s also been requests to add more,” Nedweski said. “We had a deal on DEI. Would you say that the UW system kept up their end of the deal?”
“Yes,” Rothman said.
“I wouldn’t say that’s what the audit says,” Nedweski said. 
Rothman responded that the UW has gone above and beyond the terms of  the deal, having reduced staffing by 43 positions even though the agreed upon deadline won’t arrive until December 2026. 
“We were on our way when the [Legislative Audit Bureau] did its field work in May of 2024,” Rothman said. “Since that time, we have made significant progress, and we are in compliance with the agreement as it relates to the positions. We’ve exceeded what we said we were going to do.” 
Nedweski said she was concerned about being able to measure the outcomes of the investments in DEI programs. 
“We now have a pattern within the UW system and our other state agencies where taxpayers are making investments in things like employees teleworking without knowing if there’s productivity. We’ve heard repeatedly from the UW system that we don’t really know their actual impact,” Nedweski said. 
Rothman noted that nearly 36,000 students graduate with degrees from Universities of Wisconsin schools each year. 
“I think that is an extraordinary [return-on-investment] for our state,” Rothman said. 
Murphy asked Rothman about a letter from the Trump administration sent to over 60 schools, including UW-Madison, warning that they could face consequences if they don’t address “antisemitism” on campus. UW-Madison is one of many schools where students joined encampment protests against the war in Gaza last spring. The Trump administration has said the university didn’t properly protect Jewish students.
“How do we control this antisemitism problem on our campuses?” Murphy asked. 
Before Rothman answered the question, Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) interjected, asking what the topic had to do with the budget. 
Murphy shot back that, as chair of the committee, he could ask what he wanted. 
“If you think this isn’t a budgetary issue, I think you should talk to Columbia University and see what they would say about that,” Murphy said. Columbia became a target of the Trump administration after large student protests there and has had over $400 million in federal funding, mostly for medical and other scientific research, terminated, despite agreeing to police student protesters and place the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies under scrutiny.
Rothman said the UW system is navigating First Amendment issues and being inclusive, but that the UW has done a lot of work to ensure that all students, including Jewish students, those with conservative beliefs, veterans, those who are disabled, “feel they are part of the campus community.”
Democrats on the committee expressed concerns about federal cuts to research funding, potential threats to Pell Grants and student loans and the targeting of international students. 
Emerson asked about the impact of federal cuts to research. The Trump administration has been targeting funding for higher education institutions across the country, including cutting over $12 million in research funding to UW-Madison. The flagship campus has laid off six employees so far.
Rothman said he is deeply concerned about the federal cuts. UW-Madison and UW-Milwaukee are both tier one research institutions and the federal government invests about $1 billion annually in UW schools for research, Rothman said. 
“It’s not like we can start five years from now, six years from now… These research engines were built over generations,” Rothman said. “If they are not maintained, that’s gone.” 
Rothman said the impact would be felt in sectors across the state including as research would be lost and researchers even in the private sector could be affected as many are educated at public universities. 
Rothman said that philanthropic support would be incapable of filling the gap that would be left from federal funding cuts.
Nedweski said she thought there is skepticism among taxpayers about the federal funding of research. She asked whether the UW system is expecting Wisconsin taxpayers to pick up the cost. 
“I don’t think that the state could afford to pick up what could be lost,” Rothman said. “I think what’s going to happen if that occurs is that research capacity is going to decline, research infrastructure is going to decline and that will be our new reality going forward.” 
Emerson also asked Rothman whether the Trump administration’s move to cancel foreign students’ visas is having a “chilling effect” on prospective international students. Dozens of UW students and alumni, including 26 at UW-Madison, have had their visas cancelled by the Trump administration in recent weeks as a part of an unprecedented nationwide move by the federal government targeting international students. 
“Do we have fewer applications from international students for next school year?… Are there international students who are thinking of finishing their bachelor’s or higher education back home?” Emerson asked.
Rothman said that it was too early to know as most applications have already been submitted. He said that about 10,000 international students attend UW schools.
“We may have a number of international students who might be accepted into our universities that will not come because of this. We know there is anxiety among our international students just generally, for reasons that are understandable,” Rothman said, adding that the university is seeking to support students, but is  not providing legal representation to them.
Private, nonprofit schools and tech colleges on budget requests
Wisconsin Association of Independent Colleges and Universities President Eric Fulcomer told lawmakers the top priority for private nonprofit colleges and universities is doubling the funding for the Wisconsin Grant (WG-PNP) Program, which provides assistance to undergraduate, Wisconsin residents enrolled in a degree or certificate program at non-profit, independent colleges or universities based in Wisconsin, from $57 million to $114 million.
Fulcomer’s organization represents 22 private nonprofit colleges and universities in Wisconsin, including Marquette University, the Medical College of Wisconsin, Beloit College and St. Norbert College. It also includes Northland College, which was founded in 1892, but announced in February the school will be closing after this year’s graduation due to financial hardships.
There has been no additional investment in the grant program in the last two state budgets. Private, nonprofit schools don’t receive state funding to sustain their operations, but many students rely on the funding to be able to attend the schools. 
Among its neighboring states, Wisconsin ranks last when it comes to the amount of need-based grants awarded to students attending private nonprofit schools. The investment would not bring Wisconsin to the top, but would bring it to the middle among states in the Midwest. Currently, Wisconsin can give a maximum amount of $4,400.
The schools’ request is more than the governor’s budget request; Evers  proposed a 20% increase.
“I would prefer a larger increase,” Fulcomer said. “20% would be welcomed but it’s not enough to move the needle.”
If there is no increase in the budget, Fulcomer said the award will need to be reduced to $3,850, bringing Wisconsin even further below its peers.
Nedweski asked if he had suggestions for where the money for the budget request could come from. The state has a $4 billion budget surplus, which Evers wants to pull from to fund many priorities in his budget.
Fulcomer noted that about a quarter of all bachelor’s degrees and a third of all master’s degrees come from Wisconsin’s private, nonprofit schools and that students are providing millions in revenue to the state via taxes. 
“It’s a good investment, but I’m not in a position to tell you where you might find those dollars,” Fulcomer said.
“We are not operating with a lot of extra money in the next biennium. If you get more, it has to come out of somebody else’s bucket,” Nedweski said.
Rep. Rob Kreibich (R-New Richmond) commented that he thinks lawmakers “should reward success” and he admires the retention and placement rates for the private schools. 
Emerson asked about what would happen if the Pell Grants were reduced or eliminated — a question that comes as the federal grants face a shortfall and as there is also uncertainty surrounding the future of student loans. 
“Potentially we’d be looking at a 27% cut to enrollment,” Fulcomer said. “Cutting the Pell Grant or eliminating the Pell Grant would be devastating for our sector.”
Wisconsin Technical College System President Layla Merrifield asked for  about $60 million from the state, including $45 million that would go toward general aid for its 16 colleges. The technical college system’s budget for 2024-25 totaled about $1.3 billion with $592.9 million coming from state aid. 
“There’s almost no better investment that you could make in Wisconsin’s economy, in its workforce and its people than the technical college system,” Merrifield said. “Our outcomes are well documented. We are transparent with our data, both our failings and our successes.”
Murphy thanked Merrifield for her approach to the budget. 
It is “a little bit what we were looking for from the UW today…,” Murphy said. “They want $855 million, but it’s taken nine months, and we still don’t have very much detail around what they expect to do with that money.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin has issued a letter asking elected leaders in Milwaukee to temper the acquisition and use of surveillance technologies by the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD). On Thursday evening, the police department went before the Fire and Police Commission (FPC) to push for the use of facial recognition technology. This, along with the common council’s recent approval of drone usage by the MPD, has spurred the ACLU to call for a two-year pause on the adoption of new surveillance technologies, and craft frameworks to regulate the technology MPD already has “with meaningful opportunities for community input.” 
Although it acknowledges that many on the council and within MPD “care deeply about the safety and well-being of our city,” the ACLU’s letter also warns that “history has shown time and again, authoritarianism does not always arrive with flashing lights and villainous speeches — it often comes wrapped in routine procedure, paperwork, and people ‘just doing their jobs.’” 
“We are already seeing how surveillance technology is being weaponized in real time,” the ACLU continued, citing data-gathering, automatic license plate readers, artificial intelligence (AI), and other tools that are used to “target and detain individuals.” 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The MPD has long denied that it uses facial recognition technology. As part of an investigation into surveillance technologies which the department obtained ahead of the 2020 Democratic National Convention (DNC), Wisconsin Examiner reviewed “investment justification” records from the state’s Homeland Security Council which suggested that the Southeastern Threat Analysis Center — a homeland security-focused aspect of the MPD’s intel-gathering Fusion Center — utilized Clear facial recognition technology. It was described as a “mobile device” that would allow police to “conduct timely identification of individuals in the field to prevent terrorist attack.” 
By contrast, MPD PowerPoint presentations prepared for the April 17 FPC meeting openly advertise the use of facial recognition. The PowerPoint details two examples of arrests made using facial recognition software. One “case study” from March 2024 involved a fatal gun violence incident where the suspects fled. The PowerPoint said that they were later seen at a gas station, and that facial recognition software provided leads to both suspects. Noting that “facial recognition results are advisory in nature and are to be treated as investigative leads only,” the PowerPoint states that a Department of Corrections agent confirmed the software’s results, leading to arrests the next morning. 
One of the PowerPoint slides shows in-custody photographs of the arrested men above pictures of them masked in a gas station. The slides showed that the facial recognition software had a “similarity” rating of 99.7% for one man, and 98.1% for another. Both men are waiting for a trial. The other case study focused on a sexual assault incident involving a gun. Like the other example, surveillance footage of the suspect from a gas station helped lead to the arrest. MPD sent out a facial recognition request to local agencies. It was answered by the Wauwatosa Police Department, which returned two pictures of the same individual. The pictures had similarity ratings of 99.1% and 98.9% respectively. The arrested man was sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
The PowerPoint presentation lists 14 cases from the North and South Sides of Milwaukee. It states that MPD “would be diligent in balancing the need for effective, accurate investigations and the need to respect the privacy of others,” and that facial recognition does not establish probable cause to arrest someone or obtain a warrant. “It may generate investigative leads through a combination of automated biometric comparisons and human analysis,” the PowerPoint states. “Corroborating information must be developed through additional investigation.” 
 
PUBLIC Facial Rec for FPC
A PowerPoint presentation detailing the Milwaukee PD’s plans for facial recognition software. 
 
MPD has reviewed procedures for the technology’s use nationwide, and stated that “oversight of the system will consist of an audit report showing information requested, accessed, searched, or disseminated.” All requests for facial recognition must be approved by a supervisor, and the department will keep a log of each search and the type of crime involved. Biometrica is the chosen facial recognition vendor. The PowerPoint states that the company has worked with the NAACP and the ACLU to provide anti-bias training for users of the software. 
The reassurances, however, do little to quell the concerns of privacy advocates. In their letter to the MPD and common council, the ACLU of Wisconsin highlighted ongoing immigrant roundups by  the Trump administration, and the deportation of Milwaukee residents to a notorious maximum security terrorism prison in El Salvador. “It is being used to monitor and prosecute political protesters, people seeking reproductive health care, LGBTQ+ individuals, and doctors trying to provide care,” the letter states. “These are not projections — these are present-day realities carried out by bad actors within the federal government and local jurisdictions.” 
The ACLU letter warns, “while we trust that our local leaders and police officers have good intentions, history reminds us how quickly larger systems can override those intentions.” 
In recent years MPD has expanded its network of surveillance cameras and other activities such as its phone surveillance operations remain shrouded in secrecy. MPD has also built up its social media surveillance footprint using AI-powered software, after downplaying the very existence of those activities in years past. 
“Data collected in Milwaukee does not stay in Milwaukee,” the ACLU states. “Once it enters a federal pipeline, it can be accessed, shared, and used in ways we cannot predict — or stop. That’s why now, more than ever, we must choose restraint. The rule of law at the federal level is unraveling before our eyes.”

The same set of concerns came up during a March 20 FPC meeting, where commissioners discussed the MPD’s use of drones and facial recognition technology. Police officials claimed that complaints about law enforcement using drones lagged behind the rate of agencies acquiring the technology, suggesting that the public approves. Police officials said that MPD’s “Airborne Assessment Team,” which is attached to the department’s Specialized Patrol Division, would help increase situational awareness, de-escalate dangerous situations, aid search-and-rescue, help manage major events and offer unique opportunities to “positively engage” with the community. In protest situations, drones would allow MPD to monitor an area while not physically placing officers nearby, whose presence could trigger an escalation among the protest crowd. 
MPD said that its drones do not have facial recognition capabilities. Still, the growth of MPD’s surveillance powers have worried some community members. Commissioner Bri Spencer said during the meeting that it would be nice for a community-based tech advisory board to be established to help review MPD’s surveillance requests. Spencer said that nationwide and historically, it’s not unheard-of for law enforcement surveillance programs to get out of hand. 
“I get it for water rescue, I’m very worried about things like protests,” said Spencer. “I think for very good reason. Our federal government is doing some very funky things right now with protesters. So I get what you’re saying, and I see in the SOP that you’re like, ‘We’re not going to do that.’ I don’t know if that’s sufficient in terms of a protection, particularly for people who are skeptical about the use of these technologies.” 
Police officials said that drones are a crowd management tool, and that during the Republican National Convention (RNC) they helped monitor protest movements to ensure opposing groups didn’t come into contact with one another. Spencer reiterated, “I think I just worry about the cost to individual civil rights and, like, how that’s going to just keep growing in our society…I wish the public had more input into whether or not the use of this type of technology is happening here. Talking to the community is not the same as letting them have a decision about whether or not they want drones in their city being run by police.” 
MPD spokespeople said the department based its drone usage procedures on best practice guidance from the ACLU, and that the department is “very late” to the drone game. The Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office, for example, officially announced its drone program in 2021.

Ahead of the DNC nearly five years ago, the MPD acquired large white vans called “critical response vehicles”, which are also attached to the Specialized Patrol Division and came equipped with their own tethered aerial drones. Wisconsin Examiner found that the sheriff’s drones were used to monitor police accountability protests, with the number of flights dropping significantly once the protests subsided. 
In its letter Thursday, the ACLU stressed that police abuse of surveillance “is not ancient history” but rather “it’s living memory for many in our city.” Some may remember the reign of police chief Harold Breier, who surveilled civil rights activists, LGBTQ+ communities, and Black Milwaukeeans. “And those who carried out that surveillance often believed they were ‘just doing their jobs.’” The ACLU’s letter questions what a personality like Chief Breier would do with today’s surveillance powers. 
“We’re not calling for a ban,” the letter states. Instead, the ACLU calls for a  two-year pause on acquiring new surveillance technologies, especially facial recognition technology, “while we assess the potential risks.” In the meantime, the letter urges city leaders to “pass a framework for regulating existing surveillance technology, such as adopting a Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) Ordinance to bring accountability to these decisions before it’s too late.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot_2021-03-15-Wisconsin-Examiner.png,,,2025-04-18 07:00:17.247106

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Dozens of bills are headed to the governor’s desk for final sign-off, but even more have stalled — or appear to be dead altogether.
Despite earlier momentum, legislation dealing with rape kit backlogs, immigration enforcement, social media restrictions for minors, and more ultimately missed key deadlines and failed to advance in the final weeks of the session.
Those issues won’t be officially settled, however, until lawmakers close out the session for good. Bill language could still reappear elsewhere — via closed-door conference committees — during the coming days.
Republican leadership said they plan to finish this year’s business by Thursday, April 24, but the session isn’t legally required to end until end-of-day on the following Tuesday, April 29.
‘Dead for good’
Although a bill prohibiting some Hoosier minors from using social media without their parents’ permission got bipartisan support in the Senate, the House took no action.

Senate Bill 11 would have required anyone under the age of 16 to secure permission from their guardians before accessing apps like Facebook, Instagram or TikTok. Another provision allowed Indiana’s attorney general to issue a civil investigative demand to determine if a social media site violated the law, with civil penalties up to $250,000. 
Following a 42-7 vote in the Senate in January, the bill was assigned to the House Judiciary Committee. Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, never gave the proposal a hearing.
The bill’s author, Sen. Ryan Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, attempted to amend the language into a foreign trade bill during the second half of the session, but he told the Indiana Capital Chronicle it was deemed non-germane, so he never called it for a vote.
“It’s dead for good,” Bohacek said, but he’s open to bringing the bill back in 2026.
One of several controversial anti-immigration bills this session also died in the second-half of session despite passing the full House in February.
House Bill 1531 would have mandated local compliance with federal immigration detainer requests and leveraged local government funding to ensure cooperation with federal authorities like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
It also would have targeted employers who hire a person who is not legally allowed in the U.S.
The bill died after the Senate Judiciary Committee, helmed by Fort Wayne Republican Sen. Liz Brown, declined to hold a hearing.
“I’ve had a lot of conversation with Sen. Brown in the second half of the session … she’s not comfortable moving it this year due to a few different things in the bill,” said bill author Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, who could file a similar bill in a future session. “I’m still looking at other options, but more than likely, it’s not moving this year.”
Still, a separate immigration-focused proposal, House Bill 1393, is headed to Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.
 Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, speaks on the House floor on Jan. 30, 2024. (From Prescott’s official Flickr page)
The bill requires jails and detention facilities to tell county sheriffs when they have probable cause to believe that someone they’re booking on unrelated misdemeanor or felony charges isn’t legally in the country. Sheriffs would have to report that information to ICE.
Senators additionally killed a contested elections bill that aimed to put school referendums and public questions only on general election ballots. 
Rep. Tim Wesco, R-Osceola, who authored House Bill 1681, previously emphasized that more voters participate in general elections than primaries. Democrats opposed, arguing that the change would strip local control and put more financial stress on schools.
Ultimately, though, the referenda language was signed into law in Senate Enrolled Act 1.
Also dead is House Bill 1413, which sought to eliminate the state’s backlog of rape kits and help counties with legal costs. Rep. Becky Cash, who authored the proposal, pointed to the current six- to eight-month wait for rape kit processing in Indiana, which crime technicians and law enforcement have attributed to a lack of equipment and staff.
The bill earned unanimous support from the House, and the chamber’s budget-drafting committee created a $2.5 million line item for the proposed Rape Kit Backlog Fund. Momentum continued in the Senate corrections committee, but the multi-million dollar appropriation is likely in jeopardy following this week’s grim revenue forecast. State budget writers said cuts are on the way.
Left out of the budget, too, was a $500 tax credit per newborn child for eligible taxpayers — or $250 for a married person filing a separate return.
Originally offered in Senate Bill 497, the credit would have been available for families earning up to 720% of the federal poverty level. The proposal passed 47-0 from the Senate but never made it into the state’s spending plan.
Other bills on the chopping block
Hundreds of other bills additionally failed to cross the finish line. Among those are:
House Bill 1174, pay day loans: The House narrowly advanced Rep. Jake Teshka’s bill to create new, longer-term loans of up to $5,000 — with steep monthly service fees stacked atop interest and other charges. The measure would have also allowed lenders overseeing larger borrowing, like car loans, to charge interest rates as high as 36%, up from the current cap of 25%. The Senate’s insurance committee left the bill untouched.

House Bill 1285, special education classroom cameras: A repeat attempt by Rep. Beck Cash, R-Zionsville, to mandate round-the-clock electronic recording equipment in special education classrooms, sensory rooms, seclusion spaces and time-out areas was stripped from the underlying bill by the House Education Committee. What’s left in the measure — which has since advanced from the Senate and is awaiting final House approval — are provisions to allow parents an opportunity to collect their student’s property if the child no longer attends the school, and another to permit parents to record meetings concerning their child’s individualized education program. The bill also requires schools to always have present in each building at least one employee who has obtained nonviolent crisis intervention training.
Senate Bill 126, annexation: An attempt to bridge the differences between House and Senate lawmakers in an annexation compromise met its demise last month after the author criticized the process and rebuked committee members. Sen. Jim Buck, R-Kokomo, has repeatedly authored legislation to rein in what he describes as an “abusive” form of annexation that’s “tilted in favor of the municipalities.” But he rejected an attempt to meld two bills into an annexation compromise, seemingly killing the effort altogether.
House Bill 1432, iGaming: A push to legalize online lottery and casino games passed easily out of the House Public Policy Committee earlier this year but didn’t get a hearing in the Ways and Means Committee, which would’ve taken a closer look at the financial aspects of the proposal. Rep. Ethan Manning, R-Logansport, authored the bill and estimated that the digital lottery and casino games, coupled with sports wagering tax hikes, could bring the state of Indiana more than $300 million annually in new revenue. But some were concerned that online options would cannibalize in-person gaming or lottery sales.
House Bills 1618 and 1237, new state emblems: A lively committee presentation by Jasper Elementary School fourth-graders was not enough to convince lawmakers to name the persimmon as Indiana’s state fruit. That bill died in committee without a vote, as did another proposal to make Myotis sodalis, also known as the Indiana bat, the official mammal of the Hoosier State.
Opposition brings likely end to Indiana utility siting bill, but the issue isn’t going away

House Bill 1628, utility siting: Overwhelming opposition from county officials killed the Republican proposal to shift authority over large-scale utility infrastructure projects from local governments to the state. The bill received multiple hours of discussion in the House utilities committee, but it was never put to a vote and failed to advance to the full chamber. Bill author Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, called it a response to ongoing resistance of local governments to greenlight solar, wind and other renewables projects that are increasingly necessary to support the state’s growing energy demands. Locals said decision-making control over the zoning and approval processes for those proposals was theirs, not the state’s.
Senate Bill 171, abortion pills: A move to ban pill-based abortions, and to require women to file an affidavit of rape to meet one of the state’s few exceptions, got no traction. Filed by Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, the bill would have outlawed the use of abortion pills even in abortions that meet the state’s narrow exemptions. And it would have required a woman who seeks an abortion under the state’s rape or incest exceptions to provide the doctor with an affidavit under penalties of perjury attesting to the rape or incest. The same requirement was defeated in 2022 during an amendment fight.
Senate Bills 201 and 284, closed primaries and early voting: Legislation slashing early in-person voting days and closing primary elections to unaffiliated voters garnered mixed committee testimony in early February before quietly dying in the Senate. Sen. Gary Byrne’s bill would’ve cut Indiana’s early voting timeline from 28 days down to two weeks. Another measure offered by Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, would have added text to voter registration forms asking Hoosiers to choose their political parties and warning that affiliation is required to vote in a primary election. It also would’ve required county election officials to affiliate registered voters with either the Democratic or Republican Party based on their last primary election votes, and would’ve created a way for voters to change their affiliations.

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Mental illness doesn’t check voter registration. Suicide doesn’t screen for partisanship. These crises are indiscriminate and omnipresent, cutting across class, race and creed. 
Yet Oklahoma’s failure to fully fund its 988 mental health crisis hotline reveals something chilling: for many state leaders, saving lives is negotiable — so long as it’s politically inconvenient.
In 2024, more than 39,000 Oklahomans called 988 in moments of acute distress. The hotline has become a vital alternative to 911 for those experiencing suicidal ideation, substance abuse crises, or psychosis — circumstances in which police presence is often inappropriate, and occasionally lethal. 
This is not a theoretical benefit. It is a demonstrable public health tool. And yet, lawmakers continue to defer, delay, and dilute every serious effort to secure its future.
The preferred mechanism to sustain 988 — a modest monthly telecom fee — has failed in the Oklahoma Legislature. Despite being modeled after the fee that funds 911, lawmakers balk at this proposal, wary of the optics. Some cite inflation. Others gesture vaguely toward “tax fatigue.” But all of them are missing the point.
This is not a fiscal debate. It is a referendum on priorities.
When the state wants to fund something, it does — and Oklahoma is proving that. Even as the legality is still being debated by the U.S. Supreme Court, Oklahoma has been fighting to direct public dollars toward a religious charter school. Meanwhile, State Superintendent Ryan Walters has proposed spending $3 million to put Bibles in classrooms.
As of mid-2024, the Office of Management and Enterprise Services reported $8.5 billion in state collections — 2.1% above the year’s projected estimate. 
There is no budgetary emergency. There is, however, a chronic unwillingness to spend political capital on the unglamorous work of mental health care.
But the clock is ticking. Federal funding might carry Oklahoma through fiscal year 2026, but how much longer can we keep kicking the can down the road? Hard decisions can only be postponed for so long. Without a sustainable revenue stream, Oklahoma risks gutting a system that has already proven its value.
And people will die. Not metaphorically. Not someday. Actually. Soon.
When the state abdicates responsibility, the burden does not vanish — it shifts. It falls to emergency rooms, already overwhelmed. It falls to police, untrained and ill-equipped. It falls to families, who are left to navigate overdose, psychosis, and suicidal crisis without trained professionals. 
And when the system fails, it is not the politicians who pay the price. It is the parent identifying a child in the morgue. It is the patient handcuffed during a panic attack. It is the person who dies on hold.
Let’s be clear: this is not about the money. It’s about optics. About cowardice. About lawmakers who want credit for caring, but not the consequences of doing.
To call 988 “life-saving” in a press release and then vote against funding it is not just hypocrisy — it’s complicity. 
The same legislators who boast of their mental health platforms during campaign season are the ones now waffling over 60 cents a year. That’s the cost of the proposed surcharge. Less than a drive-thru meal. Less than a single Starbucks run. And yet, for some, even that is too much.
Nationally, the need is unmistakable. Suicide remains the 11th leading cause of death in the United States, and Oklahoma’s suicide rate has risen by nearly 49% over the last two decades. Oklahoma ranks among the worst in the nation for health and well-being, and 1 in 5 adults report a diagnosable mental illness. In rural counties, access is often nonexistent.
The 988 line isn’t a silver bullet. But it is a start — a bridge between crisis and care. The hotline connects callers to trained behavioral health responders, often dispatching mobile crisis teams instead of law enforcement. It prevents unnecessary ER visits. It de-escalates violent episodes. It saves lives. All for less than a dollar per person per month.
This is policy at its most basic: spend a little to save a lot. But too many lawmakers are focused on ideological optics over empirical outcomes. They fear being labeled as tax-and-spend liberals. They fear their own base. And so they equivocate, allowing a proven, necessary, life-saving system to twist in the political wind.
There is no bipartisan spin that can reconcile this contradiction. You cannot champion mental health while defunding its infrastructure. You cannot claim to care about life and then balk at funding the system that protects it. And you cannot, in good conscience, govern a state where the price of survival is deemed too high at 60 cents.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Attorneys in a lawsuit against Idaho pathologist Dr. Ryan Cole for his alleged false cancer diagnosis that led a woman to undergo major surgery reached an agreement to dismiss the case.
But almost no information about the agreement is public.
Idaho 4th District Judge James Cawthon on April 10 agreed to dismiss the medical malpractice lawsuit, following a stipulation between attorneys on both sides. That came months after Cole and the patient’s attorneys began mediation, which is a legal process to work toward agreement. 
Filed in April 2023, the lawsuit was scheduled for a jury trial in April. Granting a request from both sides’ attorneys, the judge dismissed the case with prejudice. Each party will pay their own costs and attorneys’ fees. 
In November, patient J.B.’s attorneys submitted a ream of additional evidence in court. Those included statements from six doctors — who either worked with the patient, or were independent from her medical care — that disagreed with Cole’s diagnosis of a rare and aggressive form of endometrial cancer. The Idaho Capital Sun is identifying the patient only by her initials to protect her medical privacy.
In legal declarations, two independent pathologist doctors called Cole “reckless” in rendering the patient’s cancer diagnosis.

Cole, an Idaho pathologist, gained fame for false and misleading statements he made about COVID-19. He serves as an appointed Idaho health official.
Early last year, Washington state regulators restricted Cole’s medical license in the state after they found he spread COVID disinformation and broke medical practice by virtually prescribing ivermectin to COVID patients. The drug — long used as an anti-parsitic in humans but which lacks evidence to treat COVID — can now be sold over the counter in Idaho, after the Legislature widely approved the deregulation this year.
Cole and his attorney, Nancy Garrett, could not be immediately reached for comment. Mallam Prior, an attorney for the patient, declined to comment to the Idaho Capital Sun, saying the lawsuit’s outcome was confidential.
 Two pathologist doctors call Cole’s misdiagnosis ‘reckless’ in legal declarations

In 2021, Cole ran a laboratory being used by women’s health practices in the Boise area. J.B.’s nurse practitioner sent Cole’s lab a biopsy from her body that summer. 
She had invasive surgery after Idaho Dr. Ryan Cole misdiagnosed her. Now she’s suing.

After she underwent surgery to remove her female reproductive system, J.B. learned she didn’t have cancer, the Sun previously reported.
Part of Cole’s stance against COVID vaccines included false claims that they cause cancer.
There is no evidence that COVID vaccines can raise, or lower, a person’s risk of cancer. There is evidence that they lower a person’s risk of severe illness, death and chronic health issues after a COVID infection.
“I have seen a 10- to 20-fold increase of uterine cancer in the last six months in my laboratory,” Cole said at a meeting of America’s Frontline Doctors in San Antonio, Texas, about two weeks after he misdiagnosed J.B. with cancer of the uterine lining. “In the last six months. When did we start shots? January? How much solid-tumor cancer increase are we going to see over the next several years? Probably a lot.”
In November, as part of the plaintiff’s additional evidence submission, J.B’s attorneys wrote that Cole “claims to have retracted his comment that he was seeing a 20-fold increase of endometrial cancer in 2021 when there is nothing he can point to in order to demonstrate he has actually done so.”
Actually, Cole’s cancer diagnosis records — which the plaintiffs’ attorneys obtained as part of the lawsuit’s evidence discovery process — show “less than a 1% increase,” the legal filing alleged. 
That was part of the patient’s attorneys’ request for a jury to require Cole to pay punitive damages in the lawsuit.
  Dr. Ryan Cole speaks at a “Defeat the Mandates” rally in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 23, 2022. “Let doctors be doctors, and let us treat patients and save their lives. Don’t shackle our hands. We will not comply with your silliness,” he said. (Screenshot from livestream video)
Six other doctors — including five pathologists — evaluated the patient’s tissue samples and disagreed with Cole’s diagnosis, the filing alleged.
Dr. Matt Tannenbaum, an Idaho Falls pathologist who disagreed with Cole’s diagnosis of the patient, wrote “it is my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability and far more likely than not that Dr. Cole was negligent and reckless when misdiagnosing (the patient) with serous carcinoma.”

Dr. Paul Cohen, who serves as chair of pathology at Yale University’s hospital in Connecticut, wrote that “Dr. Cole’s level of incompetence in this case rises to the level of being reckless.”
“He either knew or should have known that there were problems with the diagnosis of serous carcinoma, that it was an incorrect diagnosis, and that by rendering such diagnosis it was creating an unreasonable risk of harm to (the patient) and a high probability that such harm would actually result,” Cohen wrote. 
Cole maintained his cancer diagnosis for J.B. was correct, despite the lawsuit and another review of the slides since his initial diagnosis, the filing alleged. 
 Cole is still licensed as doctor in Idaho, and serves on Central District Health board

The medical malpractice suit J.B. filed in Ada County accused Cole of negligence and other harms. The lawsuit also was against his business Cole Diagnostics, based in Garden City. 
Washington regulators restrict medical license of Idaho doctor who spread COVID-19 disinformation

The company is still registered as an Idaho business and lists Cole as president, business filings from the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office showed Thursday night.
Cole is still licensed to practice medicine in Idaho, the Idaho Board of Medicine’s licensing records website shows.
In 2024, his Idaho license temporarily lapsed, prompting questions about his status on the Central District Health board, the Sun previously reported. In September, Cole renewed his Idaho medical license.
Central District Health is a regional Idaho government public health agency that serves Idaho’s two most populated counties in and around Boise — Ada and Canyon — and two rural counties: Elmore and Valley. 
Cole remains on the Central District Health board.
In the state of Washington, Cole’s medical license is active with restrictions, the Washington State Department of Health’s website shows.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont said his message of money out of politics resonates across the political spectrum. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)How strange that due to the disastrous policies of “their president,” Montana’s all-Republican Congressional delegation and governor are now too scared to even face Montanans in town halls.  And yet Bernie Sanders flies into Missoula on his national “Fighting Oligarchy” tour and draws “thunderous applause and standing ovations” from an over-capacity crowd of 9,000 Montanans on an afternoon in the middle of the week.  
Why?  Because people know Bernie is telling the truth about what’s going on in this nation, not fabricating excuses and downplaying the very real damages taking place while they hide under their MAGA hats.  
He’s also correctly calling out the fact that both Republicans and Democrats are responsible for the on-going tragedy that sees American democracy, once the envy of the world, turning into an oligarchy of billionaires whose greed knows no bounds or even a scintilla of concern for “the little people.”
Nor was Bernie speaking from a bullet-proof cage surrounded by nasty looking thugs with sunglasses and earbuds to ensure no one gets close to him.  Quite the opposite — top Republicans nowadays don’t dare do what Bernie did — walk out into the overflow crowd of thousands to shake hands and talk directly to the people who couldn’t get in.  
The few Republican politicians who dare venture into the realm of “we the people” are being met by angry crowds whose interests and hope for a better future they have so grievously betrayed.  Just ask 91-year old GOP Senator Chuck Grassley, who was bluntly told “his” people in supposedly “red state” Iowa are now really “pissed” because he won’t stand up to “dictator” Trump.   
In an astounding contrast, there’s no denying that Bernie’s huge crowds are showering this 83-year old dynamo with love and hope, many with tears in their eyes because his words go straight to the challenges they are experiencing and they want to believe that somehow we can overcome the insulated and isolated billionaires and return our government to the people, not the 1 percenters who want ever more, no matter the cost to the rest of us.
That’s part of the reason Bernie Sanders is the most popular Senator in the nation. In his own words from his Missoula speech: “We can either have extreme wealth inequality, with the toxic division and corruption that it requires to survive, or we can have a fair economy for working people along with the democracy and freedoms that uphold it. But we cannot have both.” 
Speaking truth to power, Bernie laid it out: ““We don’t accept this blue state–red state nonsense. We are the United States of America, not red states, not blue states.  I believe honestly that I speak for conservatives, moderates and progressives, for the overwhelming majority of the American people, who understand that there is something fundamentally wrong in our campaign finance system where billionaires can buy elections.”
Apparently that rankled Montana’s millionaire governor, Greg Gianforte, who posted: “Bernie Sanders and AOC are in Montana pushing their far–left agenda — but Montanans rejected them and their puppet Joe Biden after four years of failed policies. The people have spoken. They aren’t feeling the Bern.”
I got news for the gov — who has never drawn anything close to Bernie’s crowds or approval ratings. Bernie won the Montana Democratic primary election in 2016 because he, not Hillary Clinton, spoke to Montanans’ concerns. They “felt the Bern” then and obviously are “feeling the Bern” again.  Why?  Because they’re feeling burned — by Gianforte, our do-nothing congressional delegation, and by the eternally lying fool in the Oval Office.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bernie-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 07:00:17.247106

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Idaho Medicaid allows people with disabilities to live their most independent lives, makes preventive care accessible, helps ensure safe deliveries of healthy babies, assists seniors when they are most vulnerable, and saves families with medical emergencies from financial ruin. 
That’s why it’s alarming that Congress is considering $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. This staggering figure puts health care at risk for more than 340,000 Idahoans — half of whom are children. By cutting $364 million from Idaho’s health care system, it would force Idaho into an impossible bind: slash critical health services or raise taxes. 
Republicans in Congress are eyeing cuts to Medicaid. But what does Medicaid actually do?

U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo’s recent statements opposing health care cuts are heartening. It’s imperative that our entire congressional delegation take a thoughtful, bipartisan approach to keep Medicaid whole. 
Proponents justify these cuts with claims about reducing “fraud, waste, and abuse.” But let’s be clear:

Fraud is rare and usually involves deliberate billing schemes by corporations, not patients gaming the system.
Waste often means system inefficiencies, such as avoidable emergency room visits or lack of care coordination, that are best solved through smarter care models, not blanket cuts.
Abuse can refer to overbilling, administrative errors, and regulatory gray areas — which call for oversight, not slashed funding.

These terms are often used to create political cover for cuts that hurt people. In truth, 95% of Medicaid dollars go directly to pay for health care rather than administration. This is a much higher rate than any private insurance company can claim. With as lean and efficient as Medicaid is, there is not $880 billion worth of fraud to eliminate — only critical services that keep our health system functioning. 
Rural Idaho would be disproportionately impacted. One in five rural residents depends on Medicaid. When funding drops, clinics close, providers leave, and health care access disappears. This makes our existing health workforce shortage, already severe in 43 of 44 counties, much worse.
Proposed nationwide “work requirements” are also harmful. Most working-age Medicaid enrollees already work, or can’t due to illness or caregiving responsibilities. 
Previous experiments with work requirements led to thousands of people losing coverage, not because they were ineligible, but because of bureaucratic red tape. These policies are costly to administer and serve only to push people off care, doing nothing to assist with employment.
Furthermore, cuts to Medicaid don’t save money; they just shift costs in harmful, expensive ways. When people lose coverage, they are forced to roll the dice: sometimes delaying care until it’s less effective, costlier or too late. They may end up with emergency room bills they can’t afford. 
When hospitals absorb the costs of uncompensated care, everyone pays higher insurance premiums and health care costs, while health outcomes worsen.
Instead of rushing to slash the backbone of our health care safety net, let’s press pause and assess the consequences for Idaho. Congress should focus on smart, targeted reforms: Strengthen fraud prevention by investigating the companies that are bad actors. Lower prescription drug prices. Expand provider access in rural areas. These real solutions don’t jeopardize people’s lives or Idaho’s economy.
We must stop the gutting of health care benefits for our neighbors, veterans, cancer survivors, seniors in nursing homes, and people living with disabilities. Congress is on recess and back in Idaho this week and next. We hope Sen. Crapo, Sen. Jim Risch, Rep. Mike Simpson, and Rep. Russ Fulcher will hear from Idahoans on how important it is to protect Medicaid for future generations.

But what many still don’t know is that every one of them was certified by a single, government-run lab in Bruceton, Allegheny County in Pennsylvania. It’s called the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. The name N95 actually comes from their certification standards.
The lab, near Pittsburgh, is operated by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) and is the only facility in the country that is capable of offering the agency’s stamp of approval. The same lab certifies a host of other protective masks and respirators used by firefighters, doctors, painters, factory workers, coal miners, pharmaceutical manufacturers, welders, chemical plant employees, construction crews and others. Many American employers are statutorily required to provide them to workers.
An estimated 5 million Americans workers are required to use respirators at their place of employment.
But according to a dozen current and former NIOSH employees and union representatives who have worked at or with their personal protective equipment division, that lab has halted almost all of its regular work and is preparing to shut down in June.
That’s because of the most recent announcement of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency, run by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees across its various divisions. Hundreds of those cuts are in NIOSH, the division that studies and recommends ways to prevent workplace health and safety hazards.
“It’s kind of the sabotage of guide rails that have been set up for industry to help keep workers safe,” said Jonathan Szalajda, a lab employee and former deputy director of the National Personal Protective Technology Lab. “It’s a situation where we’re leaving workers defenseless, and I think it’s certainly a step back from what we’ve done to protect workers over the last half century.”

Since the beginning of mass layoffs at federal agencies overseen by the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), virtually every employee at the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory has taken a buyout or early retirement offer, been put on administrative leave, or received a notice that their job is subject to what’s called a “reduction in force” and that their last day will come in June.
It’s not clear if the impending layoffs will hit every remaining employee because, according to workers and union officials, leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control have not been answering questions. Moreover, almost all of the lab’s supervisors have been placed on administrative leave, along with their HR contact.
The reduction in force notices are confusing as well. Some sent out to individual employees note that layoffs will happen in their division, and they may or may not be subject to them. But another sent to the union that oversees the bargaining unit employees at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab said all of their jobs would be eliminated. Virtually every lab employee that isn’t part of that union has already been placed on leave or told their position will be terminated in June.
Given the lack of communication, and the sweeping layoffs that have hit other parts of the federal government, including NIOSH itself, employees at the personal protective equipment division are expecting the worst.
Already, the lab’s workforce has shrunk from 120 to 70 this year, and the remaining employees are facing layoffs that the Department of Health and Human Services says will come in June.
A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referred questions to the Department of Health and Human Services, which did not respond to multiple inquiries from the Capital-Star. NIOSH is a research agency within the CDC, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
“We have no idea what we’re supposed to do,” said one remaining lab employee who spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “We have no idea what to tell the manufacturers. This is so important, we just feel there’s no way this can be real.”
Szalajda said the lab has stopped accepting requests from manufacturers to certify new respirators. The remaining lab employees who weren’t laid off have shifted their focus to preparing for the lab to be shut down.
New research has also stopped because of time constraints and a freeze on federal employee credit cards that has made it impossible to buy necessary materials.
Instead, workers are finalizing research projects that are near completion, and preparing them for publication.
‘Someone will have to own the travesty’
Szalajda and others have said they expect the lab’s closure to result in the market being flooded with substandard masks.
Along with certifying new products, lab employees regularly inspect respirator manufacturing plants and test masks that have already been approved to ensure they’re still being manufactured to NIOSH standards. That work, however, has stopped, largely because of a freeze on approval of employee travel reimbursement. According to Szalajda, the lab has also stopped sending out contractors because they’re not certain they’ll ever be paid given the rapid changes.
Szalajda worries about “a Wild West scenario” where respirator manufacturers are free to cut corners in production, and no one will be there to catch them.
“The American public, if you’re buying a respirator or a mask to do home improvements or hobbies or anything, you’re going to be at the mercy of those companies to not become lax,” said Linda Chasko, a NIOSH employee who was speaking in her capacity as vice president of the federal employees union that includes the Allegheny County NIOSH campus employees.
The potential closure has also alarmed industry members, who have spent significant time and money ensuring their respirators meet NIOSH standards, and rely on the certification for new products.
The closure of the lab could also cede the respirator market to foreign companies whose products are tested according to their own government’s standards. NIOSH certification, however, had often been referred to as a “gold standard,” Szalajda said.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, KN95 masks were often billed as an alternative to N95s, which were at times difficult to find. The primary difference is that KN95s were certified in China. However, issues were found with a number of certified KN95s, which led to numerous recalls.
There is also a fear that counterfeit masks will spread. Part of the Personal Protective Technology Lab’s mission was to find and study respirators with fake NIOSH-approval stamps, and work with distributors to stop their spread.
One of the last research projects that lab employees are working to finalize is a comprehensive study on the efficacy of counterfeit masks. They found that virtually all of them failed to consistently meet NIOSH standards for filtering air particulates. Between an HHS communications freeze and uncertainty that the report can be finalized before the lab closes, it’s unclear if the report will ever be released to the public.
“We’re expecting there could potentially be an influx of counterfeit equipment,” said Chasko. “What’s at stake is the respiratory health and overall health of all the workers in industries that use equipment reliant on NIOSH standards.”
The lab’s closure could also cause problems for certain industries, like coal, where companies are statutorily required to provide NIOSH-certified respirators for miners. It’s unclear what will happen if NIOSH is no longer able to provide that certification.

For example, every underground coal mine is required by law to provide specialized respirators called closed-circuit escape respirators. They’re for the worst case scenario: escaping a deadly and low-oxygen environment where something has likely gone very wrong.
Those respirators are not just approved by NIOSH, but regularly audited by the lab to ensure they still work after being stored in harsh underground conditions with heavy dust exposure. The same masks are also required in certain Navy ships.
“We have found failures,” one employee said about their regular audits.
Personal protective equipment researchers in Morgantown, West Virginia, the other NIOSH office where research on respirators and protective gear is done, were also hit with layoffs.
One Morgantown NIOSH employee who worked with the personal protective equipment team on firefighter safety recommendations was notified on April 1 that they would immediately be placed on administrative leave. That will end with their termination on June 1.
Still, they’re hoping the decision will be reversed, and requested anonymity for fear of being targeted in the event that some employees are brought back.
“We were told it was just going to be a consolidation … that the scientists would not be let go,” the employee said about the layoffs, which have affected almost everyone at the Morgantown NIOSH campus. “But the scientists went in the first round.”
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the federal employee union that represents the Morgantown NIOSH employees, said almost all work at the division has stopped, with almost everyone put on administrative leave ahead of terminations in June.
“You wouldn’t believe how confusing it’s been,” Tinney-Zara said. She said leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have not been communicating with union officials. She can’t even provide an exact number of workers who have been told they’re being laid off.
Mostly, she gets updates through the news like everyone else. Most recently, U.S. Rep. Riley Moore, a West Virginia Republican, said some of the layoffs at the Morgantown facility, which does extensive work on coal miner safety, were made in error. But Tinney-Zara hasn’t been able to confirm that or find out where he got that information.
“It’s a real tragedy,” Szalajda said about the lab’s closure and cuts at NIOSH. “For people who work in this business, it’s not just the paycheck. It’s a lifestyle. People who have been involved within our division, they work there because of a mission, the attractiveness of doing something that makes a difference in people’s lives.”
But Szalajda is hopeful that HHS may still reverse course. He and other employees are waging something of a pressure campaign by reaching out to lawmakers, industry partners and media.
Moreover, he believes that even if the lab, or most of NIOSH, is shut down now, one day it will be replaced. But it may be a hard learning curve for whoever’s brought in to get it running. He expects many of the most experienced people on staff now, would not return.
“It’s just kind of a recipe for disaster,” Szalajda said. “It may not be something that happens right away, but there will be some sort of incident that will show the void of what’s been left from stepping away, and someone will have to own the travesty that comes after that.”

The Japanese automotive maker is being impacted by President Trump’s new 25 percent imported automobile tariffs. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)I’m old enough to remember when hundreds of thousands of Buicks, Mercurys, Oldsmobiles, Plymouths and Pontiacs rolled off the assembly lines every year in Flint, Dearborn, Lansing, Detroit and Pontiac, the respective hometowns of these storied brands.
The problem is that too many other people, including influential policymakers, also wistfully recall those days and somehow believe they can be resurrected.
Mercury, Oldsmobile, Plymouth and Pontiac ignobly landed in the junkyard of automotive history decades ago.
There hasn’t been a Buick built in Flint, the brand’s former hometown and birthplace of General Motors, since 1999. Buick still exists but sells only a small fraction of the approximate 800,000 U.S.-produced vehicles it shipped to dealers annually in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
President Donald Trump says he’s determined to restore U.S. auto manufacturing through stiff tariffs that will force domestic and foreign automakers to build all the cars and trucks they sell to American consumers here.

While he has repeatedly flip-flopped on tariffs for other goods, such as smart phones, Trump is holding steady (at least as I’m writing this sentence) on 25% tariffs for foreign-built autos and parts. Those include many vehicles built outside the U.S. by Detroit automakers.
(Whoops. The president said he’s considering pausing tariffs to give the industry more time to build plants in the U.S.)
“Foreign automobile industries, bolstered by unfair subsidies and aggressive industrial policies, have expanded, while U.S. production has stagnated,” Trump said on March 26 in announcing his own aggressive industrial policy.
Trump sees a hermetically sealed U.S. auto industry as the centerpiece of his plan to create a “golden age of America.” And his hyper-loyal lieutenants charged with implementing the tariffs couldn’t be more delusional in their support.
“(W)e want the tires made in Akron. We want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw. And we want the cars manufactured here,” said Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro.
Trump puts the blame on the decline of the U.S. auto industry squarely on free trade. Trade deficits with other countries have led to “the hollowing out of our manufacturing base,” distorted supply chains and threatened national security, he said.
His common refrain is countries that run a trade surplus with the U.S. are “ripping us off.”
(Side note: popular Chinese-built Buicks saved the brand from extinction, although Buick and other non-Chinese automakers are struggling there as of late.)
Some economists agree that globalism has destroyed millions of blue-collar factory jobs in the U.S.
Prominent among them is Susan Houseman, director of research at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo. Houseman has been widely noted for her eye-opening  finding that liberalized trade with China in 2001 was the root cause of the staggering loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
Other economists insist the decline in manufacturing employment has been a result of increased productivity made possible by the proliferation of factory robots.
“What you see is that the real story in the auto sector is automation,” Jason Miller, a Michigan State University business professor, told CNN Business.
Surprisingly, there are more automotive assembly jobs in the U.S. then there were in 1994, the year the much-maligned North American Free Trade Act took effect, according to Labor Department data cited by CNN. (There are about 183,000 fewer auto parts jobs than at the start of NAFTA.)
It’s a different story in Michigan because of something we don’t like to talk much about—the precipitous competitiveness decline of the Detroit Three automakers.
Except for monster pickup trucks and gargantuan SUVs, American consumers generally prefer Asian and European brands not built in Michigan. That’s tough to say for someone like me, who grew up in a mostly GM family.
Ford, GM and Stellantis (formerly Chrysler) sold just 5.4 million cars and light trucks in the U.S. last year, down nearly 60% from the more than 12 million cars they sold in 1999, according to a University of Michigan economic forecast.
Overall, 15.8 million cars and trucks were sold last year in the U.S., dominated by foreign brands.
Forecasting sales this year is a nightmare because of Trump’s 25%, confusing tariffs on foreign-built cars and parts. But higher prices resulting from the tariffs could cuts sales by 700,000 vehicles this year, according to auto analytics firm Cox Automotive.
In February, before the auto tariffs were enacted, U-M economists predicted the Detroit Three’s U.S. market share would fall to a record-low 32.7% by 2026 following decades of declining sales.
Less market share means less need for assembly plants, parts and workers. It shouldn’t be surprising then that auto manufacturing employment in Michigan has plunged from its most recent high of 91,000 in 2000 to about 49,000 in February.
They key to reversing that trend is for the Detroit Three to build more vehicles that appeal to American buyers lost to Honda, Hyundai and Toyota. Tariffs won’t save them.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2208357928-1024x704.jpg,,,2025-04-18 06:05:42.546358

Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, speaks during a floor session in the Senate on April 17, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A North Dakota legislative committee this week recommended adding $1 million in the budget bill for the Office of Management and Budget for a “life education committee” to teach people about abortion alternatives.
The amendment was brought by Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg.
Myrdal said the program would help inform pregnant women considering abortion of other options.
“What we’ve found in the state is that they don’t have information about what those are: pro-life centers, adoption services for women and families in crisis pregnancy,” Myrdal said. 
North Dakota Supreme Court hears arguments over abortion ban

The state’s Abortion Control Act already requires health care professionals to make pregnant women aware of alternatives before they can obtain abortions.
The committee established by the amendment would oversee a campaign to teach the public about state abortion laws, laws and policies “supporting life and family values,” as well as resources available for pregnant mothers, families and children, it states.
While the campaign would be supervised by the committee, it would be carried out by a third party contractor, according to the amendment.
The contractor would be hired through the Office of Management and Budget in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.
The committee would include three people appointed by Gov. Kelly Armstrong, two people chosen by the House majority leader and two people chosen by the Senate majority leader.
The life education committee would also be tasked with overseeing a video the state must produce to educate abortion providers about state abortion laws, the amendment states.
Lawmakers set aside $50,000 for the video under House Bill 1511, which Armstrong signed into law on Wednesday.
Bridget Turbide, executive director of North Dakota Right to Life, spoke before the Government Operations Division of the Senate Appropriations Committee in favor of the amendment on Wednesday. The amendment originally recommended $1.5 million, which Turbide said is needed to educate the public properly. Lawmakers cut this down to $1 million.
Some committee members asked why Turbide wanted the state to conduct the program as opposed to a private organization.
She said that the messaging would be more effective coming from the state.
“The public are going to agree with the state education over the private a lot of the time,” she said.
North Dakota judge vacates state abortion ban, ruling it unconstitutional

Sen. Terry Wanzek, the committee’s chair, asked Turbide to prepare more specific details on how third-party contractors would use the money to share with lawmakers.
The amendment was made after the budget bill had its public hearings in the House and Senate.
Christina Sambor, an attorney and lobbyist for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, questioned why the amendment was rolled into the Office of Management and Budget bill so late in the legislative session.
“Why wasn’t this a separate piece of legislation that requires a public hearing like everything else?” she asked.
Sambor also noted that the North Dakota Supreme Court sent a strong message against lumping policy issues to budget bills when it ruled in 2023 that the state’s previous OMB budget violated the state constitution’s single-subject rule.
Myrdal said the amendment aligns with existing laws that signal the state’s preference for birth over abortion.
“This is just going forward as a state and doing what we can to inform people of the services. It’s not really controversial,” Myrdal said.
When asked if the amendment constituted a policy change during the appropriations process, Myrdal said no. 
“Appropriations should not write policy and there are times they go, ‘Shoot, we forgot that little thing,’” she said.
Katie Christensen, state director of external affairs for Planned Parenthood North Dakota Action Fund, said the campaign and proposed committee would be a “disastrous use” of public money.
“North Dakotans are facing real struggles accessing sexual and reproductive health care, and yet politicians obsessed with banning abortion care about one thing: pouring money into their misguided priorities,” she said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor.
The committee gave the bill a do-pass recommendation. It is headed to the full Senate Appropriations Committee next. 
Lawmakers passed a law in 2023 that banned all abortions, except in cases of rape or incest in the first six weeks of pregnancy or when the pregnancy poses a serious health risk to the mother. That law was struck down by a district court judge last fall, who found that women have a right to seek abortions for any reason up to the point of fetal viability.
The state appealed the lower court’s decision to the North Dakota Supreme Court, which has yet to rule on the case.

Bryan King, R-Green Forest, speaks against Senate Bill 354, the $750 million Franklin County prison appropriation, on the Senate floor on Monday, April 7, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)With one major exception, Arkansas lawmakers gave Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders almost everything she asked for in the 95th General Assembly, and even then it wasn’t a total loss.
The Legislature’s Republican supermajority passed bills addressing Sanders’ priorities: maternal health, a higher-education overhaul, concerns about the effects of social media platforms on children and restrictions on the influence of China in Arkansas.
The big exception: funding for a planned 3,000-bed prison in rural Franklin County on the western side of the state. 
Senate Minority Leader Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, told the Advocate Wednesday that he’s experienced longer and more challenging sessions since being elected to the state Legislature in 2010, but the 2025 session saw “quite a lot of conflict.”
Much of the controversy arose over efforts by one legislator to dissolve the State Library and its board and another lawmaker’s efforts to police the use of public restrooms. Then there was a conflict about funding a new state prison.

“The biggest story is probably the defeat of the appropriation for the prison in Franklin County, especially considering that was one of the governor’s top priorities,” Leding said. 
A $750 million appropriation bill to support the prison’s construction died after five failed votes in the Senate this month. Sanders has pushed for the new penitentiary to alleviate overcrowding in county jails. State officials and residents have fought against the project, citing concerns about transparency, infrastructure and staffing. 
State lawmakers this week also challenged a separate bill that would have added $250 million to a correctional facilities set-aside fund into which the Legislature placed $330 million during the 2023 legislative session. 
An additional $75 million appropriated in 2022 for prison expansion has already been allocated to the Arkansas Department of Corrections, which can use the funding to move the project forward. 
Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said Wednesday that money will support the hiring of architects and engineers who can help officials get a better understanding of the project’s overall cost. Initial estimates set the prison’s price tag at $825 million.  The state Board of Corrections has already sought proposals from architects and general contractors.

“I would have liked to have funded the entire prison, but the members saw fit to just fund a portion of it, and that’s great,” Hester said. “We’re moving in the direction we want to go, just not as fast as we wanted to go.”
Putting a more positive spin on the rejection of the $750 million appropriation bill, its primary sponsor, Searcy Republican Sen. Jonathan Dismang, told the Joint Budget Committee Monday that the corrections department isn’t likely to use all $75 million allocated to the agency before next year’s fiscal session — when lawmakers can again explore options for funding prison expansion in April. If officials need more money before then, they can request lawmakers’ approval for a temporary appropriation increase, he said.

Sanders’ effort to address the state’s poor maternal health outcomes found bipartisan support this session and culminated with her signing Act 124 into law just two weeks after announcing the policy.
The Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act changes the state’s Medicaid program by establishing presumptive Medicaid eligibility for pregnant Arkansans, offering reimbursements for doulas and community health workers and establishing pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage for specific treatments.

Aaron Pilkington of Knoxville, are at right during a press conference at the state Capitol on Feb. 6, 2025. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)
Arkansas has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation, and the third-highest infant mortality rate, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. 
Sanders last year convened a Strategic Committee for Maternal Health to develop recommendations for addressing the state’s maternal health crisis. Sanders’ efforts have not included support for expanding Medicaid coverage for postpartum mothers from 60 days to 12 months after birth because she said it would be “duplicative.” Arkansas is the only state that has not taken advantage of this federal option.
Rep. Aaron Pilkington, R-Knoxville, and Sen. Breanne Davis, R-Russellville, presented legislation this session that would have provided the extended coverage to qualifying pregnant Arkansans. House Bill 1004 advanced through the House before failing in a Senate committee earlier this month. 
Arkansas’ Medicaid expansion program, called ARHOME, covers people up to 138% of the federal poverty level. ARHOME covered 237,327 Arkansans as of the end of February, the latest figures available from the Department of Human Services. Regular Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program covered another 230,058 adults and 421,192 children, for a total 888,577 Medicaid beneficiaries.
Since Jan. 1, 2023, Medicaid covers pregnant Arkansans with incomes of up to 214% of the federal poverty level, or about $45,200 for a family of two or $68,700 for a family of four. 
This coverage expires two months after birth, leaving many postpartum Arkansans to “fall through the cracks,” Davis told the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee on April 9. 
“We have got to address this holistically, and I think there’s been a lot of really good work done, but it has not included this group of women,” who do not qualify for Medicaid expansion, she said.

The proposal to expand coverage had supporters from both political parties. House Minority Leader Rep. Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, proposed a similar bill that was never heard in committee. 
Social media
Sanders signed two bills Wednesday that she said in January’s State of the State address she hoped would reach her desk during the session.
The two bills cleared the Legislature on the last two days of business. One new law allows parents to file civil lawsuits against social media platforms if content on those platforms harms their children, and the other amends the state’s blocked social media age verification law.
The Social Media Safety Act of 2023 was the first of its kind in the nation and required social media platforms to verify the age of new account holders in Arkansas. Those under 18 could only access sites with parental permission. A federal judge temporarily blocked the law before it went into effect and permanently blocked it in March.
The amendments to the Social Media Safety Act will go into effect in August. They more clearly define social media and apply the definition to more platforms, lower the age of minor users from under 18 to under 16 years old, prohibit social media algorithms from targeting minors, and add a penalty for noncompliance.

The other bill Sanders signed would hold social media companies accountable for showing and promoting content to a child without that child’s consent if viewing the content leads to “significant bodily or cognitive harm.”
Sanders has yet to take action on a third social media regulation bill on her desk, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act. That bill would ban technology companies from collecting data from Arkansas minors except under specific circumstances, such as for financial transactions.
Companies would also be barred from retaining that data and disclosing it to third parties that use the information in advertising targeted to children, and they would be required to provide notice and obtain consent if they are collecting data under permissible circumstances.
Ballot measures
Sanders signed a slew of bills that place new restrictions on direct democracy, the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote. Many were sponsored by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, who in 2026 will run for Secretary of State, the office that oversees elections.
Hammer and other Republican lawmakers said adding regulations to the process of soliciting and gathering signatures on petitions will protect the integrity of direct democracy and discourage fraudulent behavior.
New requirements include but are not limited to:

Signature gatherers, known as canvassers, must inform potential signers that petition fraud is a criminal offense
Canvassers must request a photo ID from potential signers
Potential signers must read a petition’s ballot title or have it read to them
Ballot titles must be at an eighth-grade reading level or lower
Petition sponsors cannot submit more than one conflicting petition at the same time

Democratic lawmakers and members of the public said the restrictions will have a chilling effect on the people’s right to initiate new laws and constitutional amendments.
In February, a committee rejected a proposed enforcement agency within the Secretary of State’s office to investigate the validity of submitted ballot initiative documents.
On Wednesday, the final day of the session, the House voted down a bill that would have given the Legislature the authority to overturn voter-approved constitutional amendments.
The Red Menace
The Legislature also took up multiple “foreign adversary” bills. While the bills technically targeted several nations — such as Iran, Russia and North Korea — China has been repeatedly mentioned by lawmakers intent on rooting out the Communist country’s perceived influence within Arkansas.
Sanders promoted the legislation, saying in press conferences and on social media that Arkansas is the first state to “kick China off of our farmland and out of our state.”

The session’s efforts built off of legislation passed in 2023 and 2024 that limited Chinese businesses from owning land in Arkansas and prohibited them from operating cryptocurrency mining facilities.
Many of the bills passed in the last days of the session, such as House Bill 1680, which built on Act 636 of 2023’s prohibition against land ownership by foreign adversary-controlled businesses. HB1680 added more prohibitions on such businesses, banning them from holding leases on land or having an interest in agricultural land within 10 miles of “critical infrastructure” such as dams or power generation facilities.
Other foreign adversary bills targeted higher education. Act 473 of 2025 requires extensive screening of individuals being considered for employment by a university or college if the person is from a covered foreign adversary such as China, depending on the role they are being considered for. It also creates a high bar for higher education institutions to enter into research agreements or cultural exchanges with groups from foreign adversary nations, requiring they be rejected unless a strong state interest is identified.
Another bill, House Bill 1352, prohibits funding for institutions of higher education that have a Chinese cultural center or a Confucius Institute. A federal government report in October 2023 noted there are fewer than five Confucius Institutes left in the U.S. since Congress restricted federal funding to schools with institutes. 
Under House Bill 1604, government agencies would be prohibited from buying promotional items such as stickers and mugs from Chinese businesses, while House Bill 1683 would bar government agencies from buying electric vehicles or their components if the vendor could not certify that it was not made using forced labor. 
HB1683 took particular aim at alleged forced-labor practices in China — specifically mentioning alleged human rights abuses committed against the Uyghur people — although the importation of goods made with forced labor has been illegal in the U.S. since 1930 with the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. 
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act of 2021 established that there is a presumption that all goods imported from China’s Xinjiang region, where allegations of forced labor are concentrated, are produced using forced labor.

(Photo: John Partipilo)The Tennessee General Assembly’s 2026 budget trimmed $35 million from a funding bucket intended to support ongoing efforts to preserve North America’s most ecologically diverse freshwater river while serving the growing Middle Tennessee population’s water needs.
The Duck River, a “scenic treasure” according to Gov. Bill Lee, provides water to an estimated 250,000 Middle Tennessee residents. Its water levels reached concerning lows in 2025, and an increase in dead mussels signaled the river’s health is in peril, scientists say.
Lee’s budget proposal originally earmarked $100 million “to create a regional water supply strategy that will solve this problem once and for all,” he said in his 2025 State of the State Address.
The $59.8 billion budget approved by the Tennessee General Assembly on Wednesday allocated $65 million to projects involving the river. House Majority Leader William Lamberth, a Sumner County Republican, said in a Thursday news conference that when viewed “as a whole, 98% plus of the budget was almost exactly what the governor proposed.”
TDEC: $100M Duck River budget ask could be used toward regional Tennessee River pipeline

Rep. Jody Barrett, a Dickson Republican, represents Hickman County, which is bisected by the Duck River. While his constituents’ concerns about the river are mostly environmental for now, residents of neighboring Maury County are looking toward the Duck as a “saving grace” for water shortages, he said.
“Certainly $35 million is going to have some practical impact. As far as how that money was going to be used, I’m not exactly sure, so I don’t know that it will be a considerable immediate impact,” Barrett said. “But obviously it’s an emergency situation, depending upon where you are along the river.”
Barrett said he understands part of the reasoning behind the funding redirect was a lack of specificity on how the funding will be used.
Lee’s November executive order to conserve the Duck River tasks the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) to “evaluate large-scale engineering projects” for cost and feasibility.
TDEC Commissioner David Salyers in March referred to the proposed $100 million as “incentive money” to encourage partnerships among regional utilities. 
Salyers chairs the 19-member advisory group created by Lee to make recommendations to the governor and state lawmakers. He told lawmakers last month that the funding could be put toward a potential pipeline from the Cumberland or Tennessee rivers to “really solve the problem” of drinking water access. 
But Salyers also acknowledged that a full solution will likely require hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of several years.
“While we are disappointed by the reduction in funding by $35 million for the Duck River projects, we recognize that conservation requires sustained commitment over time, not just in moments of opportunity,” Harpeth Conservancy CEO Grace Stranch, also a member of the governor’s advisory group, wrote in an email to Tennessee Lookout. “I am honored to serve on the Duck River Planning Partnership and look forward to working with partners across the region to identify sustainable, collaborative solutions for protecting one of Tennessee’s most vital natural resources.”

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Tennessee’s bill restricting education for undocumented immigrant students could be dead for the year.
The Lookout is hearing from key lawmakers that the measure won’t make it to the House floor for a vote this session.
Because of the potential for a major financial impact, lawmakers put the measure sponsored by House Majority Leader William Lamberth “behind the budget,” meaning it couldn’t be taken up until lawmakers approve the spending plan for fiscal 2026. They did so Wednesday, but the legislation that would allow school districts to check the immigration status of students continues to flounder in the House where rank-and-file members don’t want to be put in the position of voting on it.
A major drawback is that the bill contains no provision for the state attorney general to defend school districts if they check students’ status, thus forcing them to spend their own money to go to court to ward off a legal challenge.
Sponsors have been bucking all year for litigation that would send the question to the U.S. Supreme Court, in hopes of undoing Plyler v. Doe, the 1982 case that requires all students, including immigrants, to be educated.
The Senate version of the bill, which passed on a 19-13 vote last week, differs in that it would require school districts to determine whether students have permanent legal status in the country. The House bill makes it optional.
Both measures would allow school districts to charge tuition to students without legal status.
Without changes the bills were likely to wind up in a conference committee of House and Senate members where differences would be worked out, raising questions about whether the bill would come out unscathed.
Hundreds of people have rallied against the bill throughout the legislative session. And Sen. Bo Watson, sponsor of the Senate bill, has drawn heat from Hamilton County principals, the Tennessee Small Business Alliance and other opposition groups. 
The financial impact estimate for the bill points out Tennessee is required to follow federal Title VI laws prohibiting discrimination against students. Violations could put $1.1 billion in federal funding at risk, even though the U.S. Department of Education might be eliminated under President Donald Trump’s administration.
Lamberth told reporters Thursday he’s trying to find out if the federal funds would be endangered but said the bill could be taken up at any time.
At the very least, though, the bill is in flux. Whether it flies could be determined by whether backers want a blood bath on the House floor.
Humble to challenge Johnson
A bipartisan eruption over millions of dollars slipped into the state budget to pay for primary elections appears, in part, to be spurring competition for Williamson County’s state Senate seat.
Republican candidate Gary Humble, founder of the ultra-conservative Tennessee Stands political group, told the Tennessee Lookout this week he will run for election to the 27th District seat held by Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson of Franklin. Johnson narrowly defeated Humble in the last battle.

Humble confirmed his candidacy while criticizing a move to add $8 million to the state budget to reimburse county election commissions for holding primary elections. The Senate placed the money in the budget Tuesday during a finance committee meeting, and the House made the move Wednesday on the chamber floor.
Democrats and several Republicans who favor closing primaries and allowing caucuses blasted the move, saying they were deceived in committees when they asked whether the primary bill came with a cost.
Humble told the Lookout he considers the funding move a “slap in the face” of taxpayers. It clashes with proposals by Elevate 2025, a group that Humble supports, to hold a Williamson County Republican caucus.
Humble told the Lookout the primary bill wouldn’t have passed if it had $8 million attached, and he accused lawmakers of lying to the opponents and the public while forcing the legislature to vote on an amended budget.
Without the money, county governments would have been forced to make up the cost to hold primaries.
“Jack Johnson is leading a campaign of fraud and corruption against the people of Williamson County and the entire state for his own desire for political retribution,” Humble said in a statement to the Lookout.
Johnson, who has shied away from commenting about Humble, said the primary bill he sponsored in the Senate isn’t an effort to go after the competing political group. Johnson backed the Williamson County Conservatives group, which opposed Elevate 2025, in recent county party elections.
Nevertheless, he said the opposing group has discussed using a caucus, which he contends would be “an absolute disaster.”
“It would disenfranchise tens of thousands of Republicans that want to vote, or Democrats if they have a Democratic primary,” Johnson told the Lookout. 
Johnson pointed out state law requires primaries for general assembly and federal offices, but not for county offices and said he’s glad the legislature is “finally addressing that inconsistency.”

Caucuses, which enable party members to select party nominees instead of voters electing them at the polls, are the great political endeavors that led to the election of Andy Ogles, Tennessee’s most creative resume embellisher, as Maury County mayor. That helped buoy his career and eventual election as U.S. congressman after the legislature gerrymandered the 5th Congressional District to rid themselves of Democrats and liberal Republicans.
Similarly, Rutherford County held a caucus roughly 15 years ago that led to the election of a county sheriff who wound up serving federal prison time for fraud. He allowed his chief administrative deputy to start a company called JailCigs that sold e-cigarettes to jail inmates.
It just goes to show that bypassing voters is good, until it’s not.
Getting Nico-ed
Republican Sen. Page Walley warned colleagues Thursday that the legislature could be “Nico-ing our citizens” by passing stricter rules on the hemp industry after farmers and businesses invested in the product based on laws passed just a few years ago.
The Hardin County Republican was referring to the former Tennessee Vols quarterback Nico Iamaleava who left the team, or was dismissed, after trying to negotiate a raise in his NIL deal to $4 million from $2.1 million.
“We don’t need to Nico our law-abiding citizens who trusted us,” Walley said, as he opposed the bill.
Despite the quippy approach, senators voted 23-9 to set up a new regulatory approach to the hemp industry, putting the Alcoholic Beverage Commission in charge of policing products, and severely restricting the hemp derivative THCA – also referred to as the flower.

Although state law allows nothing above .3% THC (the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana) in items such as gummies or hemp cigarettes, once the stuff is decarboxylated, the level gets higher.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican Sen. Richard Briggs of Knoxville, told senators Thursday they were really voting on whether to legalize recreational marijuana in Tennessee and said the state has “totally unregulated” pot under the current setup.
He harkened back to Woodstock, love, peace and rock ‘n’ roll but said the weed people were smoking back then had less than 3% THC. 
“That’s your grandfather’s marijuana,” Briggs said.
Enough senators bought his argument that they turned back the clock on hemp and put the industry in turmoil. 
Something tells me, though, that folks will find a way to get their weed, one way or another.
Whose school system
The bill allowing state leaders to appoint a board to oversee Memphis Shelby County Schools passed the Senate finance committee and House finance subcommittee this week.
Tennessee lawmakers file Memphis Shelby Schools “hostile takeover” at last minute

The sponsors, Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County and Republican Rep. Mark White of East Memphis, said it’s not a “takeover,” even though opponents are calling it a “hostile takeover.”
In a sizable government expansion, both bills would give a state-appointed board authority over school district budgets, contracts exceeding $50,000 and under-used or vacant properties. The Senate bill also would allow the state commissioner of education to remove the district director and school board members. 
The rationale is that the elected board and director aren’t getting the job done. Maybe they aren’t. Then again, a lot of people would say the Tennessee legislature is doing a crappy job, too, so they’re even.
This isn’t exactly a recent phenomenon. But the pending solution begs the question: Who takes over the takeover board when there’s nothing left to take?
“Meet the new boss / same as the old boss.” *

The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts. North Carolina is also among the most reliant.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.
Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

((Photo courtesy of The Conservation Fund)On Wednesday, the Rappahannock Tribe acquired the largest amount of its ancestral lands to date with the transfer of nearly 1,000 acres from The Conservation Fund, to be preserved in perpetuity under easement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Virginia Board of Historic Resources.
All but a sliver of the four-mile stretch of shoreline that makes up Fones Cliffs, a cultural and ecological treasure that is the location of the tribe’s historic homeland, is now protected. The area is the habitat of one of the largest concentrations of nesting bald eagles along the Atlantic coast. 
“Tribal citizens will once again, after 350 years of being separated from their mother, the Rappahannock River, have unimpeded opportunities to practice life-sustaining traditions,” said Patricia Morris, the Rappahannock Tribe’s marketing coordinator, via email. “Hunting, fishing, and ceremonies can resume on the lands where their ancestors are buried.”

The tribe will co-steward the land with the Rappahannock River Valley National Wildlife Refuge, whose goal is to protect 20,000 acres of wetlands and its associated uplands along the Rappahannock River and its major tributaries. 
“We’re just real thrilled that this property is back in the hands of the people that will care for it best,” said Heather Richards, The Conservation Fund’s vice president for the Mid-Atlantic Region.
The preservation of an additional 1,000 acres will add to what is a “…very significant contiguous block of land that’s now managed for wildlife and native habitat, and that in and of itself is remarkable just in terms of the size of it and also the uniqueness of the cliffs,” said Richards. 
 A return to their homeland 

The Rappahannock people’s roots stretch back centuries before Virginia was first colonized by Europeans, and research has confirmed their presence on the ancient lands surrounding Fones Cliffs.
“Before colonization, limited archeological and historical evidence suggests people were in the river valley 10,000 years ago,” said Morris. “Captain John Smith found at least forty-three densely populated communities, indicating rich if unknown history.”
The Rappahannock people’s way of life was “centered around the river – fishing, oysters, hunting, agriculture, pottery, basket weaving, fish traps, and netting – all of which was based on the natural resources of the river,”  Morris said. 
When colonization and development displaced the tribe, forcing them inland,“it was miles away from the tribe’s life-sustaining practices,” Morris said. “The spiritual connection to the river was lost, devastating the culture and changing the history of the tribe’s struggle to survive.”
The tribe’s return to the river is the culmination of years of effort to acquire the land, which Morris said “felt a lot like climbing a mountain while carrying a moon-sized shopping bag of moving parts and pieces.”
The land transfer marks the second major acquisition of land by the tribe along the Rappahannock River in recent years. In 2022, the tribe celebrated its rematriation to 465 acres of land bordering the waterway.

The Rappahannock Tribe will now have opportunities to  expand its Return to the River program, which trains tribal youth in traditional river knowledge and practices. 
The tribe is also planning to build a small visitors’ center on the newly acquired land, new pow wow grounds, walking trails and public education and recreation opportunities through a grant from the American Environmental Restoration Initiative and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.
 Not an easy win  

Just over two years ago, the fate of the land was entirely unknown. It was in the hands of the Virginia True Corporation, a developer with big plans for the property, including the construction of an 18-hole golf course, a resort subdivision, luxury condos and federally funded housing.  
In 2022, the Virginia True Corporation put the property up for public auction as a result of bankruptcy proceedings. The Conservation Fund was the highest bidder in the public auction for the land and successfully acquired the property for $8.1 million. 
Then came more than two years of efforts to secure the funding needed to conserve the land through an easement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service before it could be transferred into the possession of the Rappahannock Tribe. 
After some “ordinary” delays in that process, the easement was completed in December of last year, and The Conservation Fund was “able to move pretty quickly to get the fee title into the hands of the tribe,” said Richards. 
 River worries 

The tribe’s long-awaited return to the River comes at a time of great concern for the health of the Rappahannock River itself. This week, it was designated as the sixth most endangered river in the U.S. by the nonprofit American Rivers. 
The nonprofit stated that “increased strain on water resources and the absence of unified water management threaten the river’s ability to meet the needs of both people and nature.”
Recently, counties along the Rappahannock River have requested to withdraw more water from it than ever before in response to residential, commercial and industrial growth in the region, raising concern amongst indigenous leaders and conservationists. 
The Rappahannock River stretches roughly 200 miles from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Chesapeake Bay and supports a diverse range of ecosystems that provide critical habitat for fish and wildlife, according to American Rivers. 
Richards said that the struggle overFones Cliffs has taught her that with the right team and perseverance,  “we can actually make some really big inroads on protecting the river and really enhancing and restoring it.”

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Virginia colleges and universities are feeling federal pressure to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies that promote representation from various backgrounds, and George Mason and Old Dominion Universities are the latest to make or propose changes that align with President Donald Trump’s Jan. 21 executive order to end DEI efforts within the public sector.
The University of Virginia was among the first in the state to respond to the rollbacks, and the Board of Visitors voted to dissolve the Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Community Partnerships March 1.Gov. Glenn Youngkin praised the move and asserted that “DEI is done at the University of Virginia.”
Trump wrote in his order that “illegal DEI and DEIA policies” violate civil rights laws.
“The federal government is charged with enforcing our civil rights laws,” the executive order states. “The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination.”
The federal government has also warned ODU and other universities and colleges to end race-based decision making​​, or they would lose federal funding.
 After renaming DEI office and axing related staff positions, George Mason considers more changes

On Thursday, GMU’s Academic Programs, Diversity and University Community Committee considered a plan recommending the Board of Visitors adopt a resolution to comply with Trump’s order by eliminating all programs, training and processes not specifically required by federal or state law and, if necessary, scrapping staff positions within 30 days of the resolution’s approval.
However, student and faculty representatives challenged the effort at Thursday’s meeting, emphasizing the importance of DEI for inclusivity and student success.
Solon Simmons, president of the university’s Faculty Senate, said at least 90% of faculty members are opposed to the resolution. He also said more time is needed to debate the proposed clauses and that the proposal appears exclusive, opposite of the university’s culture.
“The thing that stuck to me was this idea that at Mason, we want people to belong, and then … there’s a compliance piece, which I think is really important for the board to do, but if we want everyone to feel like they belong, things like this probably are not going to help that,” Simmons said.
Bryan Caplan, an economics professor at the university who was invited to speak by committee chair and Youngkin appointee Lindsey Burke, supported the idea of the committee’s dissolution. He compared DEI to McCarthyism, an era of political persecution for progressive Americans and alleged communists in the 1950s.
“Renaming McCarthyism would not have removed the threat it posed to freedom of thought on campus, and renaming DEI does not remove the threat it poses to freedom of thought on campus,” Caplan said. “GMU’s DEI has never done anything to me personally … but this has to be done to protect GMU from all the witch hunts that we’re going to see in the future (if) we don’t do the right thing, right now.”
The resolution also proposes to dissolve the university’s Bias Incident Response Team, designed to mitigate or prevent bias occurrences, and the Access to Research and Inclusive Excellence program, which is responsible for examining university practices in identifying bias.
The university has also recently renamed the DEI office to the Office of Access, Compliance, and Community (OACC), provost and executive vice president Jim Antony and committee members highlighted, and eliminated certain positions, to ensure compliance with new executive orders.
Anthony said the Board of Visitors was scheduled to receive a comprehensive report from faculty on the university changes related to DEI in February, but the board tabled the presentation.
GMU staff did share that two vacant positions in the former DEI office were eliminated, the Antiracism Inclusive Excellence initiative was dissolved and inclusive excellence plans have been excised from the university president’s goals. 
Staff also recommended the committee engage in more dialogue before passing any resolution, to ensure it aligns with the university’s values and goals after finding a few contradictions between the proposed DEI resolution and the board’s antisemitism resolution that passed in February. 
Cameron Harris, faculty representative to the committee, said the antisemitism resolution invites OACC to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance Working Definition for training and education. However, it is not allowed in the proposed resolution.
“The resolution seems to limit education, training and most importantly, the valuing of our diversity,” Harris said.
Burke criticized DEI at the meeting, linking it to critical race theory, and suggested it undermined merit-based admissions and academic excellence. 
She also mentioned that other school leaders are dissolving DEI initiatives at institutions like the University of Virginia, James Madison University, VCU and Virginia Tech. She expects an updated resolution to be ready for the Board of Visitors’ May 1 meeting.
Va. community colleges end diversity, equity and inclusion practices

“Our job on this board is to make sure we are complying with the law and not jeopardizing the federal or state funding that may be received,” Burke said. “Federal funding is a privilege, not a right.” 
 Old Dominion’s quiet DEI changes

Unlike Mason, Old Dominion University made several changes to its DEI initiatives that remained unknown to the public for weeks. The Virginian-Pilot first reported the changes last week.
One of the major differences: ODU’s Institutional Equity & Diversity webpage was renamed Talent Management and Culture, with the banner now stating “Equity Compliance, Respect and Community.”
The original banner stated “equality, diversity, respect and inclusiveness for all.”
The new webpage excludes links to ODU’s Monarch Task Force for Inclusive Excellence, Monarch Plan for Inclusive Excellence 1.0, John R. Broderick Diversity Champion Award and it no longer states “Celebrating 85 Years of Diversity.” 
The task force’s status is unclear, with its page now leading to a 404 “page not found” error.
The nine-member Diversity and Inclusive Excellence staff page was removed from the institution’s website. The webpage now reads “access denied.”
Most of the staff appears to have remained under the new office, Institutional Equity and Culture, except for an office manager position. The remaining positions cover training, community relations, outreach, and Title IX regulations.
One of the staff members is Veleka Gatling, previously the associate vice president for equity and inclusive excellence under the Institutional Equity & Diversity office. Gatling is now the associate vice president for community relations in the Community Engagement and University Events office.
September Sanderlin was also listed under the directory as vice president for human resources and DEI in the human resources office. Her title is currently vice president for talent management and culture.
Other clues preceded ODU’s departure from DEI. Stanley Goldfarb, also a Youngkin appointee, asked about DEI in the university’s medical school curriculum and requested to meet with the school’s dean before he was removed fromODU’s Board of Visitors by Senate Democrats in May.
Goldfarb, who recently spoke on Fox & Friends Weekend about his departure, did not specify why he wanted to see the curriculum or why he wanted to meet with the dean, which he attributed to  Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera’s recommendation.
Goldfarb chairs an organization called Do No Harm, which he said represents physicians, nurses and medical students, patients and policymakers and is dedicated to keeping identity politics out of medical education, research and clinical practice. 
“We think all patients should be treated the same, that this should be a colorblind environment, that physicians should be the best individuals that are available to practice medicine and care for all patients,” Goldfarb said on Fox & Friends Weekend. “And as far as I’m concerned, it has nothing to do with the proper practice of medicine.”
Youngkin signs several maternal health bills, tweaks another on unconscious bias training

Several studies have revealed implicit bias — which DEI policies can counteract — plays a role in America’s health care system. A 2016 UVA study found “a substantial number of white medical students and residents hold false beliefs about biological differences between black and white people (e.g., black people’s skin is thicker; black people’s blood coagulates more quickly) that could affect how they assess and treat the pain experienced by black patients.” Bias can also influence how artificial intelligence applications in health care exacerbate existing disparities, research shows. 
Virginia’s legislature passed bills this session that would require medical professionals to complete unconscious bias training before renewing their licenses. Youngkin amended the measures, removing the mention of cultural competency and unconscious bias in the original wording, a change lawmakers rejected. The bill now awaits the governor’s approval as-is or veto.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Thursday announced the release of two new dashboards — one tracking maternal mortality and the other pregnancy-associated deaths — alongside an upgraded Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Dashboard that breaks down preterm birth, infant mortality, low birthweight and prenatal care data by region, race, and ethnicity.
“More moms are alive today because of the unprecedented work of the Virginia Department of Health, the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, health care providers and community partners,” Youngkin said in a statement. 
“Today’s launch is another key step to provide the data needed for this all-hands-on-deck mission. We are making significant strides, but we will not stop working until every baby in Virginia is born to a healthy mom.”
Preliminary numbers from the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) show encouraging signs: maternal mortality in 2023 and 2024 was half what it was during the height of the crisis in 2021, when 47 deaths were reported among more than 95,000 births.
But state officials and advocates say there is still a long way to go, especially for Black mothers, who face significantly higher risks of complications and death during pregnancy.
“Pregnancy and new motherhood should be a sacred time in the life of a mom and her baby. Last year, for more than 20 women and their families, it was a time of tragedy and loss,” said Virginia Health Secretary Janet Kelly. “With accurate, actionable data we can help providers all across the commonwealth do more to support healthy babies and healthy mothers and prevent these tragedies in the future.”
The dashboard upgrades are part of Executive Directive Eleven, signed by Youngkin in December, which directs state agencies to improve maternal health outcomes through better data, expanded access to quality care and increased public awareness. That order built on Executive Order 32, which revived Virginia’s Task Force on Maternal Health Data and Quality Measures last summer.
State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton, an OB-GYN, said many maternal deaths are linked to conditions like mental health challenges, cardiac issues, and chronic disease — areas where early intervention can save lives.
“For too many women, mental health, cardiac disease and other chronic diseases create difficulties during pregnancy that can lead to death,” Shelton said. “As an OB-GYN, I am grateful for the collaborative effort that has already saved lives and believe the new Maternal and Child Health dashboards will improve transparency, ensure data-driven decision-making and help us achieve even better results in the years ahead.”
The new dashboards are being released during Black Maternal Health Week, a nationwide campaign founded by the Black Mamas Matter Alliance to raise awareness and push for systemic changes to improve maternal outcomes for Black women. 
In Virginia and across the country, lawmakers are using the week to call for stronger protections and better access to care for communities disproportionately impacted by maternal mortality.
Virginia’s updated dashboards allow users to filter by year, region, race/ethnicity, and locality, providing a granular look at key indicators like maternal smoking rates, prenatal care access and birth outcomes. 
The dashboards were developed through collaboration between the VDH Office of Family Health Services, the Division of Population Health Data, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, and the Office of Information Management.
Though Virginia’s overall maternal and infant health stats track closely with national averages, state officials say the goal is to close the persistent racial and geographic gaps that leave some mothers more vulnerable than others.
“Healthy moms mean healthy babies,” Youngkin said. “And healthy babies are the foundation of a strong and thriving Virginia.”

Maryland’s high school graduation rate climbed to 88% in 2024, reaching its highest point since 2017, according to the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE). The increase of nearly 2 percentage points over the previous year marks a significant recovery following pandemic-era declines.
The 2024 data from MSDE shows significant gains among student groups that have historically faced barriers to graduation. Hispanic students saw their graduation rate rise over seven percentage points from 2023-2024, while multilingual learners experienced a dramatic increase of over 10%.
“Last year was the largest year-over-year gain of any student group, and I think that’s a testimony to targeted, sustained supports that are making the difference,” said Theresa Timmons Parrott, an MSDE official focused on multilingual education. “It’s a step in the right direction, but it’s not the finish line.”
Anne Arundel County Public Schools reported a graduation rate of 89%, two percentage points above the state average. North County High School in Glen Burnie, a Title I school, achieved a 7% increase in its graduation rate.
﻿
Bob Mosier, chief communications officer for Anne Arundel County Public Schools, said “every student group is different, and so it’s providing students with what it is that they need on an individual basis to be successful.”
“A nearly full-point jump in overall graduation rate is a very significant accomplishment,” said Mosier. “We also had six schools that increased by two percentage points or more.”
Mosier credited the district’s progress in part to Project Graduation, a systemwide initiative launched two years ago to provide tailored support to students at risk of not finishing high school on time.
“It really is a laser-like focus on individual students and what those students need in order to graduate, graduate on time,” Mosier said about the project. “We put that in place two years ago, … and we’re starting to see that pay off now.”
In Baltimore City, the four-year graduation rate rose by one percentage point for the 2023 graduating class. MSDE said the district focused on ninth-grade intervention and reducing chronic absenteeism, two predictors of long-term academic success. According to MSDE’s public dataset, Baltimore also saw improved outcomes among English language learners and students experiencing homelessness.
Statewide, female students continued to graduate at higher rates than male students, and white and Asian students graduated at higher rates than their Black and Hispanic peers. Students with disabilities graduated at a rate of 69%, still well below the statewide average. Economically disadvantaged students’ graduation rate increased slightly from 2023, graduating at a rate of 82%.
The graduation rate report comes as Maryland begins to implement the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, a landmark education reform law that aims to expand early childhood education, increase college and career readiness and close equity gaps. Several of the strategies outlined in the Blueprint — including community school models and increased funding for English language learners — align with areas of progress highlighted in the 2024 data.
“If you dig down into the Blueprint, it really lays the foundation for the strategies we’re seeing pay off,” Parrott said. She attributes a large portion of the progress made to broaden access to early childhood education, target funding for multilingual learners, and mandate college and career readiness pathways by tenth grade.
 
﻿
While the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future has driven recent graduation gains, lawmakers enacted adjustments this year due to a projected $3 billion budget shortfall. The Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, passed in April 2025, includes a three-year delay in implementing teacher collaborative time and provisions to freeze increases in funding if state revenues significantly decline.
Still, regional disparities persist. While some districts reported graduation rates above 90%, others, particularly in rural counties on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland, sit at 80% and below. Education advocates say these gaps underscore the need for continued investment and monitoring.
“This is great news for Maryland,” State Superintendent of Schools Carey Wright said in a press release from MSDE. “When we set high standards, deliver strong instruction, and invest in proven supports, our students show that they will exceed expectations.”
As the 2025 graduating class enters its final year, educators and policymakers are cautiously optimistic. The latest data suggests that Maryland’s post-pandemic recovery is underway, however state education officials say it will require long-term commitment to equity, funding and student support services to maintain.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Fabian Schmidt, a German-American man living in Nashua, was returning home from a visit to Luxembourg on March 7 when he was detained by immigration officials at Boston Logan International Airport in early March and taken to a detention center in Rhode Island, according to his attorney.
Schmidt’s family said that, upon his detainment, Schmidt was stripped naked, placed in a cold shower, and violently interrogated, according to a press release from attorney David Keller. He was also reportedly being denied his medications for anxiety and depression, and being given little food and water as officials pressured him to relinquish his green card.
His mother, Astrid Senior, told NBC News that she doesn’t know why her son was being held.
“I feel helpless, absolutely helpless,” she told the news broadcaster.
Schmidt has lived in the U.S. since he was a teenager and has legal permanent resident status, according to the family. Court records in California, where he previously lived, show that he faced misdemeanor charges for possession of a controlled substance and driving under the influence in 2015 and 2016, respectively, among other minor charges. However, his family said those issues had been resolved in the courts and are no longer ongoing.
Officials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — have not provided a justification for Schmidt’s detainment. They have, however, denied the allegations that he was violently interrogated.
“These claims are blatantly false with respect to CBP,” Hilton Beckham, assistant commissioner of public affairs for Customs and Border Protection said in a statement to the Bulletin. “When an individual is found with drug-related charges and tries to reenter the country, officers will take proper action.”
Schmidt has a court date scheduled in June in Boston.
“I’ve been very disturbed by the reports that I’ve read about this case,” U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander, who represents New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District and Schmidt’s Nashua, said. “We have been in close communication with Fabian Schmidt’s family, and we are working to get as much information as we can and to support in every way that we can.”
U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan said her office, in collaboration with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s office, has inquired within DHS and spoken with Schmidt’s family. She declined to speak on the issue during an event Monday, and said she is “honoring the wishes of the family and their legal advisers.”
“We are in touch with Homeland Security and Mr. Schmidt’s family, but we are also respecting their privacy,” Hassan said. “There’s ongoing litigation about it, so we will respect the privacy but we continue to be in touch with them.”
She would not say whether she knows the justification for his detainment.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
Part of a broader Trump administration strategy
Schmidt is not the only legal U.S. immigrant to be part of a high profile legal battle over their immigration status. President Donald Trump, who made cracking down on immigration and mass deportation central tenets of his campaign in 2024, and his administration have launched a public campaign of deportations and detainments that have been decried as illegal and unethical after being reported by the press.
In one of the highest profile immigration-related incidents, Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and an Algerian citizen with permanent legal resident status in the U.S., was arrested by ICE officials in his New York City apartment on March 8, one day after Schmidt was detained. Khalil, who was born to Palestinian parents in a refugee enclave in Syria before ultimately immigrating to the U.S. and marrying a citizen, was an organizer of protests on Columbia University’s campus against the Israeli occupation and military action in Gaza. The State Department is currently attempting to revoke his legal status in the country and deport him as punishment for his role in the protests, a move that has generated an uproar among progressives and immigration advocates who believe Khalil has a protected right to free speech. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Khalil engaged in “antisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which foster a hostile environment for Jewish students in the U.S.” On Friday, a judge in Louisiana ruled that the State Department can deport Khalil. A federal court in New Jersey is expected to hear further appeals in the case.
Several other university students who protested Israel’s war in Gaza have also been targeted by the Trump administration.
Tufts University Ph.D. student Rümeysa Öztürk, from Turkey with a student visa, was arrested by ICE agents on March 25 in Somerville, Mass. Video of her arrest, which shows six agents in plain clothes, some of whom were obscuring their badges or wearing hoods or face coverings, went viral online and sparked furor. While federal officials have not publicly provided justification for her arrest, Öztürk was the author of a 2024 op-ed in the university’s student newspaper calling for the university to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and “disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.” Hamas was not mentioned in the op-ed.
Another Columbia University student, Yunseo Chung, an undergraduate student who has lived in the U.S. since she was 7 and is a permanent legal resident, was another target of ICE after the administration attempted to deport her over her involvement in the pro-Palesintian protests. However, the administration has been so far unsuccessful in deporting the woman, who was born in South Korea, amid a legal battle. Rubio, in a press conference last month, said the Trump administration has revoked over 300 visas of students who have engaged in pro-Palestine protest activity.
The Trump administration has also moved to purge Venezuelan and other Latin American migrants from the country under the auspices that they have connections to the violent Tren de Aragua  and MS-13 gangs. In March, the Trump administration flew 238 men to El Salvador with no due process. There, they are being detained in a notorious mega prison called the Terrorism Confinement Center, known for brutal conditions and under the control of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who has described himself as “world’s coolest dictator.” The administration reportedly used some of the men’s tattoos and clothing as the sole evidence of their gang affiliations. However, an analysis of those deportees by CBS News found no criminal records for 179, or roughly 75%, of them.
That includes Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran citizen who’s lived in Maryland for 15 years. Even after admitting in court it deported him due to “administrative error,” the Trump administration refuses to bring Ábrego García back to the U.S., saying it is up to Salvadoran officials to decide his fate. This is despite the Supreme Court ordering the Trump administration to “facilitate” his return to the country. In an appearance at the White House Monday, Bukele said he would not return Ábrego García, calling the idea “preposterous” and asking, “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?”
Those deported also include a makeup artist who immigrated from Venezuela to California in August named Andry Hernandez Romero. He had no criminal record, no known gang affiliation, and was undergoing the asylum process after fleeing his country over fears he would be persecuted for being gay and his political beliefs, according to his lawyers. Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act in these Salvadoran deportations. The move has been criticized for refusing to give the men due process and for its brutality. Rubio said Sunday that another 10 people have been sent to El Salvador.
On Friday, Trump authorized the military to take control of land along the southern border. His announced plan is to station military troops there to detain immigrants traveling into the country from Mexico. He has also previously declared a national emergency arguing “America’s sovereignty is under attack” and that the border is “overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics that harm Americans.”

These are regular people who have done everything “right” — either they signed up for their Medicare or Medicaid coverage, held onto jobs with employer-sponsored plans or were self-insured on the marketplace. Then, they got cancer and the bills started rolling in without any end in sight. Soon, the bill collectors and credit agencies came knocking. These are nurses, educators, and single parents — people who weren’t just battling cancer but debt collectors, too.
For many Virginia families dealing with a serious illness, this is not hypothetical; it is their everyday struggle. Recent reports indicate that as many as half of Virginia adults are currently navigating medical debt or have done so within the past five years. We can’t expect our neighbors, at their sickest and most vulnerable, to live under the weight of such physical and financial stress, forced to choose between lifesaving treatments or keeping a roof over their families’ head and also answer persistent, threatening calls from creditors.  
Thankfully, in Virginia, we’re seeing lawmakers take decisive action to tackle the mounting issue of medical debt and alleviate its heavy burden on families. In 2024, Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed legislation to prohibit credit-reporting for medical debt, which safeguards patients’ credit scores and enables greater financial stability. This year, the General Assembly passed House Bill 1725 sponsored by Del. Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, a bipartisan bill that aims to provide further protections to patients by shielding them from unfair medical debt collection practices. 
Youngkin has the opportunity to formalize these protections for patients, and it’s the hope of many Virginians that he does. The proposal, as passed by the General Assembly, seeks to make interest rates and accrual less punitive for Virginians dealing with medical debt, prohibit wage garnishment for patients who qualify for financial assistance and protect patients’ financial assets. 
The hope is that, by reducing the negative consequences of medical debt through this legislation, Virginia can promote healthier families, more stable communities and a stronger Commonwealth. By signing the legislation as-is, Youngkin can address the unending harms of medical debt that lead families into financial toxicity. 
Since its introduction at the start of the legislative session, HB 1725 has earned sweeping support across medical, public health and patient advocacy groups. Those within and who represent the cancer community have, for years, been sounding the alarm on the cascading harms of medical debt on patients and families, citing results from a recent survey of cancer patients and survivors that paints a troubling picture. The survey found that nearly half of cancer patients and survivors reported having medical debt related to their illness. Among them, 30% have faced credit problems and 8% have lost their homes or been forced into unsafe living conditions. Furthermore, 46% of patients and survivors with cancer-related medical debt felt harassed by creditors and debt collectors, who commonly threaten credit scores as an intimidation tactic.
This is especially troubling for younger Americans who, according to recent reports, are being diagnosed with cancer at increasingly younger ages. In many cases, these diagnoses are coming before these younger patients have a strong financial footing. HB 1725 would provide Virginia with an opportunity to promote the financial future and mobility of younger Virginians, which could entice young families and graduates of our state’s great universities to stay, establish roots and build a life here. 
Affordability is important to Youngkin. A veto on HB 1725 would run counter to his commitment to address Virginians’ high cost of living. 55% of state residents have experienced at least one health care affordability burden in the past year, making it even more important that the governor sign this legislation.
Youngkin has until the end of April to act, and Virginians cannot afford to lose momentum on this key issue. Inaction threatens to compound existing hardship and force more families out of our state or into the depths of financial ruin.  Youngkin has the power to shift the reality of disease to one where patients can focus on the most important thing: fighting for their lives. Patients in Virginia are hopeful that he takes this opportunity to disentangle individuals’ physical health from their financial health.

Sometimes, you have to wonder what century it is that some of our state lawmakers inhabit.
For a classic example of how detached from reality some have become, check out a new proposal advancing in the legislature to establish censorship boards in every school district charged with banning books that quote “include descriptions of sexual activity” or are quote “pervasively vulgar.”
First of all, the definitions are impossibly vague and will invite all kinds of destructive meddling from people who are no more skilled in evaluating literature than they are at teaching physics or chemistry.
But even setting aside the offensiveness of establishing government-run censorship boards, the notion of banning books – of all things — because they discuss sex in a society in which most kids are regularly online and vast numbers while away their days playing hyperviolent video games, would be laughable if it weren’t so sad.
If only kids could be inspired to read books.
The bottom line: Appointing censorship boards to ban books has always been a bad idea. In 2025, it’s downright ridiculous.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)In February, the Trump administration sent a letter to all state education departments with a broad message: diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in public schools must come to an end. Every public K-12 school and university must stop policies related to “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” or face a potential loss to their funding, the letter stated.
This month, a New Hampshire federal judge is grappling with whether to stop the government from enforcing the letter.
A group of organizations – the National Education Association, the National Education Association of New Hampshire, and the Center for Black Educator Development – have sued the U.S. Department of Education in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire to block enforcement of the letter. The suit is being litigated by the American Civil Liberties Union’s Racial Justice Program and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire. 
On Thursday, Judge Landya McCafferty presided over oral arguments in the lawsuit. She’s weighing whether to issue a preliminary injunction. 
The requirement is not immediate; after an extension agreed to last week, state education agencies have until April 24 to certify that the state’s schools have agreed to the conditions in the letter. But plaintiffs are hoping McCafferty issues the injunction sometime next week to halt enforcement before that deadline arrives. 
Plaintiffs argue that because the letter threatens financial repercussions against school districts that allow for DEI programs, it could in turn force schools to drop support for NEA and CBED teacher diversity programs. And the NEA says vagueness of the letter will push its teacher members to take defensive measures and avoid teaching certain topics if they think there will be professional consequences for doing so. 
But the government says plaintiffs are overreacting to the letter, which they say simply warns school districts not to fall afoul of Title VI, a federal statute that prevents discrimination in public programs based on race or national origin, and promises investigations and potential withholding of federal funding for those districts that do.
The letter that kicked off the dispute, known as a “dear colleague letter,” presents a stark portrait of public schools.
“Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” the letter reads. “Proponents of these discriminatory practices have attempted to further justify them — particularly during the last four years — under the banner of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’…” 
The letter relies on Students for Fair Admissions Inc v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, a landmark 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the court held that the race-based admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina had violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
And it says the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights would “vigorously enforce the law” and that institutions that failed to comply with federal law may “face potential loss of federal funding.”
“The Department will no longer tolerate the overt and covert racial discrimination that has become widespread in this Nation’s educational institutions. The law is clear: treating students differently on the basis of race to achieve nebulous goals such as diversity, racial balancing, social justice, or equity is illegal under controlling Supreme Court precedent.”
To the U.S. Department of Justice, the letter is not an official agency rule; rather, it is an interpretive guidance. That means it can’t be struck down by a court the way a rule can, they argued. 
Abhishek Kambli, a U.S. deputy associate attorney general who traveled to Concord to argue the case Thursday, said the letter is simply articulating existing law preventing school districts from classifying students according to their race. Kambli pointed to the Students for Fair Admissions decision, and said the dear colleague letter is simply trying to stop K-12 schools from that kind of discrimination, Kambli told the court Thursday. Already, U.S. case law has established that schools should not make distinctions on the basis of race or other characteristics except in rare circumstances, Kambli argued. And he said those circumstances must face a legal test of strict scrutiny to pass. 
The plaintiff’s hardship, Kambli said, “is due to self-censorship based on a misunderstanding of what the dear colleague letter says.”
Kambli added that the government does not claim diversity, equity, and inclusion itself is illegal; rather, it claims that schools that are already breaking the law by classifying students by race should not use the concept of DEI as an excuse to do so. 
And he said despite the colorful language in the letter, any decision by the federal government to withhold funding to a school could come only after an investigation, and would include the possibility of an appeal. “It’s a lengthy process,” he said. 
But plaintiffs say the government’s characterization understates the impact and scope of the letter. 
The letter creates the possibility of consequences for teachers because of its threat to punish school districts, who directly employ those teachers, Sarah Hinger, deputy director of the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program argued Thursday. And she said the letter contains pronouncements that are hard for teachers to apply to their instruction.  
“Every day, today, tomorrow, they go to work and they are tasked with following the dear colleague letter, along with all their other obligations,” Hinger said. “They are chilled now in their ability to speak… They are uncertain of what practices they can engage in.” 
Hinger also pointed to the Trump administration’s swift move to withhold funding from Columbia University and Harvard University, suggesting that the administration could move quickly to block funding to public schools if it decides to. 
“The chill from that is happening now, and plaintiffs are not required to wait until they are hauled into court in order to challenge an unconstitutional law,” she said. McCafferty appeared sympathetic to plaintiffs, asking Kambli questions about how teachers could cover periods of American history like Reconstruction or the Jim Crow South without worrying they were improperly teaching that America has structural racism. 
The case bears similarity to another lawsuit alleging that New Hampshire’s 2021 “banned concepts” law prohibiting public school teachers from advocating for certain topics around race and gender is unconstitutional. In 2024, the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire agreed with plaintiffs and struck that law down; the decision is currently being appealed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals.
But Kambli said those lawsuits were different because they involved state laws that directly affected teachers. The dear colleague letter should not have a direct effect on the topics that can be taught, he argued. 
“It goes toward how they treat students,” he said. “It doesn’t go toward what they teach.”
And Kambli argued the suing organizations are not linked directly to the Department of Education’s enforcement action, and lack standing to bring a case in the first place. 
Lawyers for the ACLU are attempting to add a handful of New Hampshire school districts as parties to the case, in order to make additional arguments about how the letter would unfairly affect them. But the government argued it needs more time to file a motion countering those arguments, and McCafferty has not yet approved the districts’ inclusion to the case.
For now, the parties are expecting McCafferty to issue a ruling on the injunction before next Thursday. Lawyers for the government asked her to issue a narrow injunction that affects only the named plaintiffs if she must issue one; lawyers for the plaintiffs urged a nationwide injunction. 
Under the agreement reached last week, any New Hampshire school district that signs a letter certifying that they will comply with the letter will not be bound to that letter until April 24, meaning that if the court enjoins the letter before then, the district will not be subject to it. As of Thursday, 165 New Hampshire school districts have signed on, according to the Department of Education’s website.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
Budget restrictions, staff issues and AI are threats to states’ cybersecurity

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Governments often struggle with massive new IT projects

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
Rhode Island state government hit by major cyberattack

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Rebeca Pereira for CommonWealth Beacon)Twice a year, Kathryn Szerlag, a professor of soil and water chemistry at Texas A&M, traverses the country to reunite with relatives on their family dairy farm in Northbridge, Massachusetts.

“All of [my research] came from playing in the cow manure,” she reflected on a Friday in December, the day before boarding a flight home for the holidays. “That was my day care: a pair of rubber boots.”
The farm provided a singular education. Before academia, Szerlag was a country kid entrusted with testing the butterfat concentration of the milk of 300 cows. It was there, wading in dung, that she ultimately found her subject matter: the environmental degradation wreaked by high phosphorus levels in animal manures.
The farm has remained in agricultural production for four generations, bulwarked by Szerlag’s father, her late uncle, Frank, and his son, Stephen. But it hasn’t persisted unscathed.
  Kathryn Szerlag’s family, which has owned and operated a dairy farm in Northbridge, for generations, had to sell a portion of their land to a developer to make ends meet. (Courtesy of Kathryn Szerlag)

More than a decade ago, the Szerlags sold a field and a wooded swath of land to a real estate developer. Public records show the development, Presidential Estates, carved into the erstwhile farmland a cul-de-sac of single-family homes. In compliance with the town of Northbridge’s requirement that open space account for at least one-third of a development, the remainder of the land was deeded to the Metacomet Land Trust in 2019.
The Szerlag’s land sale isn’t an uncommon choice. Census data indicate that, with their backs against the wall, many farmers sell fragments of their land to support the rest of their business. Since 1997, the number of Massachusetts farms smaller than 50 acres has swelled while the number of larger farms has plummeted.
Some farmers sell their land because there is no one to take over the family business — in Massachusetts, there are three times as many farmers over the age of 65 as under the age of 35. Others do so because the price of agricultural production has become too burdensome. An acre of farmland now costs $14,300 in Massachusetts — third most expensive nationally after New Jersey and Rhode Island. Over the past three decades, the cost of farming itself has nearly doubled.
The latest data from the US Agricultural Census show more than 100,000 acres of farmland in Massachusetts have been lost since 1997.
Almost a quarter of those acres was lost between 2017 and 2022. That’s an average of losing just under 15 acres of farmland a day, approximately 15 football fields end zone to end zone, roughly double the rate of farmland loss nationwide.
The American Farmland Trust, a nonprofit working to conserve agricultural lands, estimates that, without stronger protections, the state stands to lose between 50,000 and 90,000 acres of farmland by 2040 — a possibility Massachusetts may manage to thwart as the levers of the state Legislature begin to arc toward more aggressive farmland preservation.
More than a way of life, farmland loss across New England risks the region’s food security and the environmental contributions of farmers applying regenerative, climate-conscious agricultural practices. These approaches restore soil health, sequester carbon, improve water retention, and reduce erosion, helping the region withstand extreme weather events as the effects of the climate crisis worsen. And it is in service of these stakes that, on Beacon Hill, a commission is poised to issue a series of recommendations for confronting the 21st-century challenges facing farmers in Massachusetts.
At the Community Harvest Project, a nonprofit farm in Harvard, Tori Buerschaper trailed behind a cohort of volunteers weaving through rows of apple trees. She watched on as they sorted first grade apples from those that were blemished or bruised, bagging good ones by the dozen and setting gnarled ones aside to send to the cider mill.
The nonprofit designed this workflow to not only bridge the disconnect between consumers and the food they eat but to illuminate the realities of hunger in Massachusetts.
“We luckily live in one of the most prosperous states in the US, where it’s easy to think there isn’t hunger,” Buerschaper said. “When people have limited income, they’re forced to pick and choose. The thing you kind of get to last, or that you can more easily cut out, is food.”
So far, the model they built has been a success. In 2023 alone, CHP hosted more than six thousand volunteers at its orchard in Harvard and at its 15-acre farm in Grafton. Together, each year, the two locations yield 300,000 pounds of apples, cabbage, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, squash and other produce that’s sold to 26 partner agencies committed to combating food insecurity.
But the nonprofit’s operation wasn’t always this expansive.
In 2014, CHP was farming on leased land when donors in Harvard gifted the nonprofit 75 acres of orchard and rolling hills after more than 50 years of private ownership.
Land is in high demand in the central Massachusetts town, and Buerschaper explained that her nonprofit “could have made the decision to sell it to the highest bidder.”
“It’s very likely that would have been a developer over a farmer,” she said.










We luckily live in one of the most prosperous states in the US, where it's easy to think there isn't hunger. When people have limited income, they're forced to pick and choose. The thing you kind of get to last, or that you can more easily cut out, is food. 


– Tori Buerschaper, Executive Director at Community Harvest Project, Inc.


Years later, standing watch over the orchard’s undulating hills, these considerations seem to Buerschaper a distant reality. Now, owing to the state’s Agricultural Preservation Restriction program, or APR, the nonprofit’s land is safeguarded against any future development.
If a farmer is looking to buy land and conserve it — or protect land they already own from future development — the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture, or MDAR, will pay the farmer the difference between the land’s market value and its developable value. From then on, the state owns an easement on the land, meaning it can dictate the terms of any future land sale and use, ensuring that land remains in agricultural production in perpetuity.
Since it was established in 1977, the APR program has conserved more than 950 parcels — or 70,000 acres — of farmland across the state, and it has served as a template for farmland conservation programs across the nation. These deed-restricted acres will be farmland forever.
In 2023, CHP closed on an APR totaling almost $3 million, money that CHP’s board of trustees chose to invest. Buerschaper said the nonprofit plans to withdraw $80,000 from its investment portfolio per year. She said the funds have helped ease financial fears about “the growing pains [that] never really stopped.”
APR is one of the best tools the state has to preserve farmland. Other programs exist under the breadth of MDAR’s purview: a land licensing program for state-owned farmland; a succession-planning workshop, Farm-Pass, to help aging farmers transfer their business to a new owner; and numerous grant opportunities designed to keep farms viable and farmers employed.
But these programs are only a treatment, not a cure, for the seemingly insurmountable financial hurdles which push many farmers to sell. APR money can run out with time, and enrolling in the program to begin with may not even occur to farmers needing an immediate remedy for their financial troubles.
The application process requires patience and foresight: Once a farmer applies to the program, staff at MDAR and a third-party appraiser assess the farm’s resource value and work with the landowner to come up with a funding plan. The state’s Agricultural Lands Preservation Committee then votes twice before giving the transaction final approval. In some cases, farmers can opt in to receive federal funding from the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, extending the application process even further.
While MDAR is bound to this existing procedure, which can take years, developers are not.
With deeper pockets and greater agility, developers tend to have an advantage over the state’s interest in preservation, especially as the business of farming becomes more and more untenable.
In 2016, Sean Stanton purchased North Plain Farm in Great Barrington, land that had been protected by the APR program for decades and in agricultural production for centuries. Then, three years ago, he closed on another APR that allowed him to purchase a 75-acre property a quarter mile down the road.
MDAR encourages farmers to look for local partners to help fund up to half of the value of their easement. In Stanton’s relatively anomalous case, the town of Great Barrington contributed $92,000 to the purchase. Meanwhile, MDAR awarded him $828,000.
The state’s near-million-dollar investment in North Plain Farm wasn’t the first or the only support it gave. Stanton has received grant funding from MDAR’s Farm Viability Enhancement Program to purchase new farm equipment, and he’s taken business classes through the agency’s Tilling the Soil of Opportunity program. The funding he’s received from the state has helped support his business, but it hasn’t inoculated the farm against financial distress.

Until he decided to go back to school, enrolling in a social work master’s program at Westfield State, Stanton said he was “for years, digging a bigger financial hole.” Now, he hopes to practice as a clinical social worker as soon as 2026. He’ll become one of more than half of the state’s farmers who do not list farming as their primary occupation, and he wonders what will happen when his well of APR funds runs dry.
On the farm, he teased a joke about how farmers make money.
“This is so depressing,” he warned. “How do you make a million dollars farming? Start with two.”
For farmers who have held their APRs for longer than Stanton, concerns about their businesses’ longevity are even more acute.
In July 2001, Dean Mazzarella stood on Pleasant Street, where the road bends and slices across Sholan Farm in Leominster, and accepted a check from the Commonwealth to purchase the farm and to conserve it as farmland in perpetuity.
Mazzarella has been mayor of Leominster for more than 30 years, and by 2001 he had already seen numerous farms in and around the city succumb to a fate that Sholan Farm only narrowly escaped. Over time, Sholan’s owners aged and stopped farming the land. When the land entered the real estate market in 1999, developers drafted a plan to convert the farm’s 167 acres into houses.
That’s when the possibility arose for the city to buy the land instead. With support from the state, the city closed on an APR that totaled $4.75 million. MDAR contributed $2.6 million toward the purchase, and the Department of Conservation and Recreation funded another $1.6 million to support the farm in conserving reservoirs on the land. The city pitched in $500,000 to purchase the land and fundraised the remaining value of the easement through Friends of Sholan Farm.
In the process, Mazzarella found an ally in Joanne DiNardo, who now operates and manages the farm alongside 75 volunteers. DiNardo said the lump sum infusion from the state and other partners “helped us save the farm.” But for Sholan to meet its long-term viability goals — to expand its offerings, to stay open 12 months out of the year, to build a pavilion and other infrastructure that could attract more customers — DiNardo said a “one and done” investment won’t be enough.
Unlike privately-owned farms enrolled in the APR program, city-owned farms like Sholan aren’t eligible for APR improvement grants that could help keep the business afloat for years to come.


If Sholan’s APR money runs out and the business isn’t otherwise profitable, the city could feasibly sell or lease the land to other farmers, maintaining compliance with the terms of the easement. The land would stay in agricultural production, but the city, like all farmers who sell in the face of financial hurdles, would pay the cost.




“Maybe more cities would buy orchards, you know, farms, and maybe get schools to run them or volunteers, like we do. But after you buy the land, you’re on your own,” Mazzarella said. “So, what’s the incentive?”


Beyond these pastoral terrains and panoramic fields, over the course of the last two years, a coalition of legislators and state agricultural leaders heard testimony on the future of the Commonwealth’s agricultural sector.
Led by state Sen. Jo Comerford and state Rep. Kate Hogan, the 21st Century Agriculture Commission is expected to recommend a slate of reforms aimed at tackling climate change’s impact on farms and the demand for educational and technical assistance for farmers. Their recommendations, previewed at a public hearing in July, also address the state’s farmland freefall and the financial obstacles facing farmers. Initially scheduled to be released in December, the commission’s report received a year-long extension and will be released to the public before the end of 2025.
Crucially, the commission is poised to recommend including farms smaller than five acres in the state’s existing agricultural lands tax exemption, a change that could only be accomplished by amending Chapter 61A of the state constitution.
This measure, a reflection of how “farming has changed in Massachusetts,” is also a matter of equity for Winton Pitcoff, deputy commissioner of MDAR. “It’s important that farmers who have been excluded for a variety of reasons — particularly farmers of color through systemic racism that can’t afford large tracts of land — it’s important that we make sure that they can farm if they want to. That means making sure they can access land.”
Farmland preservation has already secured an important step forward with a measure enshrined in the multibillion-dollar economic development bond bill. For months, the must-pass bill idled unresolved following the end of the formal session, but lawmakers returned for a vote and sent the bill to Gov. Maura Healey’s desk in November.
The measure authorizes MDAR to buy, protect and sell farmland, giving the agency enough purchasing power and agility to beat out developers vying for flat, open land unlike the APR program, which is a safety net that requires foresight and patience.
“It’s pretty appealing when someone is able to give you a check right on the spot to buy your land. That’s usually a developer. That’s what leads to conversion,” explained Pitcoff. “It’s not like the department wants to become a landlord and buy lots of land. What this does is give us the flexibility to purchase land more quickly.”
The agency will need to build its buy, protect and sell program from the ground up, writing new regulations and advocating for funds from the state budget each year.
Also included in the economic development bond bill is an initiative to cut some of the red tape around non-agriculture activities on APR farms – a change that will help forge alternative revenue streams for these businesses. As long as the land in question remains in full-time commercial agriculture, MDAR may grant farmers special permits for hosting weddings, classes, charity runs, and other agritourism events adjacent to actual agricultural production.


Previously, farmers like Tori Buerschaper, who hosts a 5k fundraiser at CHP, would need to apply for a discreet permit with each occasion they plan to host an activity. The new permits will be valid for at least one year, and MDAR will have the option to renew these grants, which ultimately aim to promote what the text of the bill refers to as the “long-term productivity of the agricultural resource and the sustainability of the farm enterprise.”

In the eyes of Jared Freedman, Comerford’s chief of staff, the next step for Massachusetts is to recruit support for farmland preservation beyond the marbled halls of the State House, creating financial incentives for municipalities to prioritize preserving farmland.
This model already exists through the PILOT, or payment in lieu of taxes, program, which helps cities and towns recover some of the revenue they lose from state- or nonprofit-owned lands, institutions, renewable energy installations, and more. Land owned by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, for example, is property tax-exempt, and therefore returns no tax revenue for local communities.
In return for hosting state-owned lands, 297 communities receive aid through the PILOT program.
Freedman suggested it could be expanded to aid the state’s efforts to work with cities and towns to prevent farmland loss.
“These municipalities are struggling to pay for their schools, to pay for their fire, to pay for their EMS, to repave their roads,” Freedman said. “If you’re gonna try to protect forests and farmlands, the municipalities can’t suffer.”
In the state with one of the highest rates of farmland conversion, the stakes have never been higher.

President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imported into the United States, and a 25% tariff on Canadian barley — three things that are vital to the craft beer industry. A tariff is a tax on imported goods.

“The tariffs in general have been chaotic and disruptive to our supply chain,” said Collin Castore, co-founder of Seventh Son Brewery in Columbus. “It’s just … kind of pointless.” 
Seventh Son produces 5,000 barrels of beer annually — 3,500 is roughly its wholesale volume and about 70% of that is packaged in aluminum cans, he said. The brewery uses roughly 750,000 cans per year. 
“Breweries are facing potential tariffs on malted barley, aluminum cans, stainless steel equipment, and energy, all required in the manufacturing of beer,” according to the Ohio Craft Brewers Association. “The increased prices that importers charge to their business customers to offset tariffs are likely to cause consumer price inflation in the best case scenario and closure of small businesses in the worst.” 
The U.S. relies on Canadian imports for barley, aluminum, and steel — the three key resources in brewing beer. Barley is the base grain for beer, aluminum is used for packaging beer in cans, and stainless steel is used to brew beer. 
“There simply is not enough domestic cultivation of barley or production of primary aluminum to sustain the industries that rely on these products without imports from Canada and elsewhere,” according to the brewers association. 
Seventh Son bought four months worth of aluminum cans earlier this year, which has helped it keep prices the same, Castore said. 
“We take raising prices very seriously,” he said. “And it’s also not really a switch that you can toggle on and off terribly easily. … It’s not quite as easy as somebody just signing a blanket tariff order.”
Just like in any other industry, some people are going to buy less craft beer if prices go up, Castore said. 
“If this kind of chaotic environment continues, general consumer sentiment and spending at some point is going to take a hit, and that affects taprooms and six-pack purchases and everything in between,” he said. 
During Trump’s first term in office in 2018, he slapped a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports.  
State of craft breweries 
For the first time since 2005, the number of craft breweries decreased nationwide in 2024, according to the Brewers Association. There were 9,612 operating U.S. craft breweries in 2024. During that same year, 434 breweries opened while 501 closed.  
Craft brewers produced 23.1 million barrels of beer in 2024, a 4% decrease from 2023. 
There were only about 70 breweries in Ohio when Seventh Son opened in 2013 and today there are more than 440, according to the Ohio Craft Brewers Association. Forty-six breweries opened in Ohio last year and 53 breweries are in planning. 
Ohio craft breweries’ economic impact was $1.27 billion in 2022 and more than 12,000 people were employed by Ohio craft breweries that year.

(Getty Images)When we welcome a child into the world, we do so with hope, determination, and an unspoken understanding that, over time, they will grow into independent adults. We nurture them through childhood, guide them through adolescence, and eventually send them off into adulthood with the skills and support to navigate life on their own.
But for thousands of families across New Hampshire, this traditional parenting path is not reality.
At Lakes Region Community Services (LRCS), we support individuals with developmental disabilities and acquired brain disorders who need lifelong assistance. They depend on services funded through Medicaid waivers to live independently, safely, and with dignity — in their homes and communities.
But today, many of them are waiting.
They wait for staff — due to a workforce crisis that has left our system of care severely understaffed. Direct support professionals are the backbone of our work, but low wages, high stress, and lack of state investment have made it nearly impossible to recruit and retain qualified caregivers. Families who qualify for services can’t use them because there’s no one available to deliver them.
Now, to make matters worse, a budget crisis is threatening to add another wait — for funding.
The combination of these two crises is devastating. Without workers, people wait. Without funding, more people will be forced to wait longer. The proposed state budget is effectively bottlenecking services at both ends — failing to fund the resources we need and failing to build a workforce that can deliver them. The result? A growing number of adults with disabilities left in limbo, and families left to carry the full weight of care with no relief in sight.
Without these essential services — funded through Medicaid waivers and coordinated by nonprofit organizations like LRCS — many adults with disabilities will be forced into more restrictive, more expensive, and less humane forms of care. Natural family caregivers who are currently sustaining them are saving the state millions of dollars every year simply by keeping their loved ones at home. But that system is stretched to its breaking point.
It is unrealistic, and ultimately unjust, to expect parents — many of whom are entering their 60s, 70s, and 80s — to provide 24/7 care indefinitely. These are parents who have spent decades managing complex medical needs, advocating for education and services, and serving as unpaid caregivers while navigating their own health and aging. Their children — adults with disabilities — are still waiting for the resources and support that would allow them to live in supported apartments, hold jobs, volunteer in their communities, and live with dignity and autonomy.
The alternative? A system that is not prepared. New Hampshire simply does not have enough professional, non-family providers. If families cannot continue, and services are not in place, the state will be faced with an influx of individuals requiring round-the-clock care — care that is not only vastly more expensive, but far less person-centered.
This is not just a crisis in human terms. It is a policy failure with very real fiscal consequences.
Investing in Medicaid waiver services — ensuring that individuals with developmental disabilities and acquired brain injuries have timely access to the supports they need  — is a sound economic decision. More importantly, it is a moral obligation. These individuals are our neighbors, our community members, and in many cases, our family. They deserve to live lives of purpose, safety, and dignity — just like anyone else.
At LRCS, we remain committed to this vision, our mission. But we need the support of policymakers, the business community, and the public to make it real.
We cannot continue to ask families to bear the burden and add additional burdens when services are further reduced by budget cuts.
We need a state budget that prioritizes people with disabilities and invests in a sustainable, professional workforce. We need legislative leadership that recognizes that investing in community-based supports is not only the right thing to do — it’s the smart thing to do.
Because when people with disabilities are supported to live and work in their communities, everyone benefits. 
The individuals and families we serve have waited long enough. The workforce is stretched to its limits. And the budget cuts to Medicaid we’re facing cannot become reality.
They can’t wait. And they shouldn’t have to.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/medicaidtrump-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-04-18 05:01:52.373538

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)At least 47 protests of President Donald Trump and his administration are planned in Ohio for on Saturday. They’ll be part of more than 600 events planned nationwide.
The group 50501 is organizing the effort after joining dozens of others in sponsoring massive “Hands Off!” rallies across the country on April 5. It says its mission is to “fight to uphold the Constitution and end executive overreach.”
Since his inauguration, Trump has raised numerous concerns in that regard. He’s ignored court orders, tried to gut the independent federal antitrust watchdog, empowered the world’s richest man to fire tens of thousands from the Social Security and Veterans administrations, the Park Service, and numerous other agencies.
Trump also is trying to unilaterally alter the status of hundreds of thousands of migrants who are legally in the country and force them back to hazardous homelands such as Afghanistan and Haiti. In addition, Trump is trying to use the government to attack law firms that have sued him and his enemies, and go after a state attorney general who successfully sued him in 2023.
Melissa Portala, a leader of Toledo Persist, said that it’s vital for people to exercise their right to protest to protect all their other democratic rights.

“We need people to stand up and show the rest of the public that people are speaking out,” she said. “If they don’t see that, then they feel helpless, and a lot of people do feel helpless until they see other people speaking out… Public protest is the only way that people have to be visible. This is how we can have our voices heard.”
On April 5, millions turned out across the country to protest the actions of Trump and his administration — including tens of thousands across Ohio. In Toledo alone, between 3,000 and 4,000 showed up, according to the estimates of organizers who used clickers, Portala said.
“We started on one side of a bridge,” she said. “It took 45 minutes to walk across it, the crowd was so big.”
Portala said she expected smaller crowds this time around for several reasons. 
The group 50501 is the sole national organizer, while dozens of groups were behind the April 5 protests. This one was called with less lead time for local organizers to plan and get the word out. And this Saturday’s protests fall the day before Easter, when many have longstanding family obligations, Portala said.
Details about the 47 Ohio protests can be found here. A national listing can be found here. 
Portala said she expects participation in such events to grow in the coming months.
“I think the population is waking up and saying, ‘Oh my goodness, we’re in some deep trouble here, we need to actually take some action,'” she said.

A federal judge in Ohio permanently blocked a parental consent law for social media this week. The measure, approved as part of the 2023 budget bill, would have required social media companies verify a user’s age and block access to kids younger than 16 unless they have parental consent. The court had halted it while the case progressed and the statutes were never enforced.
From the outset, the proposal’s puzzling definitions, carve outs, and cumbersome verification methods made for a rickety structure. Despite lauding the effort to protect children, U.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley determined, “the act as drafted fails to pass constitutional muster and is constitutionally infirm.”
“Even the government’s most noble entreaties to protect its citizenry must abide in the contours of the U.S. Constitution, in this case the First Amendment,” he added.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who championed the provisions alongside former Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, disagreed with the ruling.
“We know how harmful social media is to children without parental involvement,” he said in a written statement. “This law is a commonsense solution that allows social media usage by a child under the permission of a parent, just like going on a school field trip or participating in youth sports. This ruling should be appealed.”
A spokeswoman for Attorney General Dave Yost said, “We’re reviewing the decision and will determine the next steps.”
Meanwhile, lawmakers are already back at the drawing board, working on new legislation that imposes age verification at the level of a phone’s app store, rather than platform by platform. Those bills have yet to get a hearing, but the group that successfully challenged Ohio’s existing restrictions testified against similar legislation in Utah.
Ohio Republicans propose new social media age verification plan

Marbley’s reasoning
Ohio’s law requires websites and online communities that “target” children or can be “reasonably anticipated” to be accessed by them to verify a user’s age. That verification can happen with an email, credit card, over the phone or by video conference among other options. There’s an 11-factor list to determine whether a website falls within the law’s scope and has carveouts for product review sites and “widely recognized” media outlets.
The trade group NetChoice argued the law plainly violates the First Amendment by regulating speech based on its content or the speaker. The group added the state’s explanation of which companies must comply is unconstitutionally vague. Yost fired back that the law isn’t about speech at all, it has to do with whether minors can enter into contracts. “At worst,” the state argued, the law “only incidentally implicates speech.”
Marbley dismissed the state’s contention that the law doesn’t regulate protected speech.  He drew a comparison between social media companies and publishers, and while acknowledging the analogy is “imperfect,” it demonstrates that the law restricts speech “in two consequential ways.”
“It regulates operators’ ability to publish and distribute speech to minors and speech by minors,” he explained, “and it regulates minors’ ability both to produce speech and to receive speech.”
As for the argument that the measure is really about contracts, Marbley pointed to the law’s emphasis on socially interactive features.
“These provisions do not strike at the commercial aspect of the relationship between covered websites and their users,” he wrote, “they tackle the social speech aspect of it.”
Digging further into the dispute over whether the restrictions are content-neutral, Marbley again set aside the state’s arguments. He wrote the determination whether a website targets or would likely be accessed by children “certainly requires consideration of the content on an operator’s platform.” He added the law’s 11-factor list makes it plain that content is the “essential consideration.”
Marbley found fault with the law’s carveouts for review and news media sites as well. He described giving a pass to so-called established media as “eyebrow-raising” and questioned treating a product review site differently than a book or film review site.
The law is “favoring engagement with certain topics, to the exclusion of others,” he wrote, “That is plainly a content-based exception.”
And although Marbley acknowledged the law could still stand if it’s narrowly tailored and serves a compelling state interest, he found the state simply hadn’t cleared that bar.
“Ohio’s response to a societal worry that children might be harmed if they are allowed to access adult-only sections cannot be to ban children from the library altogether absent a permission slip,” he wrote.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)A case regarding parental rights in a same-sex relationship will be heard by the Ohio Supreme Court this month. It could test not only Ohio law but the federal Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage.
The state’s highest court will hold oral arguments in a case appealed from the First District Court of Appeals to decide the parental rights of a woman who was in a relationship with the children’s mother when the child was born. But the woman was never married to the mother, and does not have adoptive rights to the children.
Priya Shahani and Carmen Edmonds were in a relationship for more than a decade, and had thoughts of getting married. But the bulk of their relationship occurred before the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges, an Ohio-based case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.
Edmonds argues the couple travelled to Boston with plans to get married, but decided against it, due to the fact that Ohio would not recognize the marriage at that time. The state also does not recognize common-law marriages.
During the course of the relationship, Shahani had three children using a sperm donor that court documents say was chosen because he matched Edmonds’ nationality.
Shahani and Edmonds sought to legally dissolve their relationship after 11 years, an agreement that included scheduled parenting time for Edmonds, but the children still held hyphenated names.
It wasn’t until after Shahani removed the hyphenate from the children’s names and filed to terminate their shared-custody agreement that the case started. Edmonds argued that the couple’s “marriage-like relationship” gave her rights to the children.
A lower court awarded Edmonds “companionship time,” but otherwise effectively ruled against both women. It refused to terminate the shared custody agreement while also not allowing a “parentage” decree for Edmonds.

When both went to the First District Court of Appeals for answers, Edmonds brought up the Obergefell case legalizing same-sex marriage.
Edmonds argued that under that decision, parental rights statutes apply in this case as they would for married couples. The appellate court said the trial court needed to hold a hearing to decide whether the couple would have been married if the same-sex marriage decision had been in place.
Ohio law only recognizes parents if they are married, have a biological connection, or have legally adopted the child, something that requires marriage in the case of the “second parent.”
The ACLU of Ohio said state parentage laws, combined with the Obergefell decision, “provide a pathway for Ms. Edmonds and other non-biological, non-adoptive, same-sex parents who were unable to have their marriages legally recognized in the state of Ohio during the course of their relationship to establish legal parentage and confer the accompanying rights and responsibilities of parenthood.”
Shahani, noted that she made “the major child-related decisions” including expenses and medical needs. She told the supreme court that giving Edmonds parental rights goes against both state law and the Obergefell decision, even if state statutes were looked at with gender-neutral language.
“This case is about whether Ohio’s courts can reinvent history as a mechanism for seizing a fit parent’s constitutionally protected rights,” attorneys for Shahani wrote in an October brief to the court.
In a state where common-law marriage isn’t recognized, the attorneys said the state constitution, as well as the U.S. Constitution, doesn’t allow state courts to “manufacture an unlicensed marriage into existence.”
“The foundation upon which a ‘would have been married’ standard rests is a hypothetical injury that the individual may have been denied a marriage license if they had applied for one, or the state may not have recognized a marriage had there been an out-of-state marriage,” attorneys told the state supreme court.
Shahani refutes Edmonds’ claim that the two travelled to Boston to get married, then changed their minds. But even if that were true, the legal result should be no different, she argues.
“Even in Ms. Edmonds’s version of events, she would not have been married to Ms. Shahani when the insemination occurred, and therefore would not have parental rights,” court documents stated, citing a state statute regarding artificial insemination of a married woman.
The law, effective as of March 2001, specifies a woman “and her husband” must sign a written consent to the insemination for the “non-spousal artificial insemination” to occur.
The case was mentioned as one of the “state oral arguments to watch” this month by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU. The center identifies “prominent or interesting state court cases,” which this month include the Ohio parental rights case, along with a challenge to Wyoming’s abortion ban, an appeal to New York City’s greenhouse gas emissions caps, the process of electing appellate judges in Arizona and voter power over zoning changes in an area of Georgia where descendants of slaves have historically taken up residence.
Oral arguments in the case will be heard on April 22 by the Ohio Supreme Court.

For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-time, minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa, and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school, or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.”
Using Health Programs To Encourage Work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women, and disabled people.
Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school, or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The Hunt for Results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”
Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia, and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives, and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
Ohio consumer and environmental advocates are calling on state regulators to address disparities within FirstEnergy’s grid after a recent report found disadvantaged communities are more likely to rely on older, more outage-prone equipment.
Areas defined as disadvantaged under the Biden administration’s Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool were twice as likely to have low-voltage circuits compared to other parts of FirstEnergy’s Ohio territory, according to the study by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Equipment was also generally older and had less capacity for normal and overload situations.
The results reflect historical patterns of underinvestment in disadvantaged communities, the report says, but the full scope of the problem — including across Ohio’s other utilities — is unclear due to the lack of information from utilities and regulators.
“The public availability of any utility data is very, very limited in Ohio,” said report author Shay Banton, a regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.
The Ohio Environmental Council submitted the report as part of FirstEnergy’s pending rate case before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and is asking regulators to address the topic in an evidentiary hearing set for May 5.
Ohio corruption scandal looms over FirstEnergy rate case

The state of the local grid matters when it comes to the reliability of customers’ electric service, their ability to add distributed renewable energy resources like rooftop solar, and a community’s potential to attract business investments that could improve its economic conditions.
Regulated electric utilities file reliability reports each spring that focus on two commonly used metrics. The system average interruption frequency index, or SAIFI, shows how many outages occurred per customer. The customer average interruption duration index, or CAIDI, measures the average length of time for restoring service to customers who lose power.
The annual reports also list factors involved in outages, with breakouts for transmission-related service problems and major events. Major events such as severe weather are considered statistical outliers that don’t count for calculating whether utilities meet their company-specific standards for CAIDI and SAIFI.
While weather accounted for the majority of time Ohioans went without power last year, equipment failures also triggered thousands of outages. For the ninth year in a row, at least one Ohio utility company failed to meet reliability standards, reports filed this month show. Both AEP Ohio and FirstEnergy’s Toledo Edison missed their marks for the average time before power is restored for customers who experience outages.
The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio also collects data on the worst-performing circuits. Individual circuits serve anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand customers. However, the state doesn’t post these reports online or disclose the circuit’s exact locations, which could be used to show whether they are concentrated in disadvantaged communities.
The SAIFI and CAIDI metrics used by state regulators did not show significant disparities between disadvantaged neighborhoods and other areas in FirstEnergy’s territory. But Banton said those reliability metrics rely on averages for large groups, which can obscure disparities. They said that utilities should also be required to publicly report the number of customers experiencing frequent service interruptions and the number of customers who faced long outages.
Utilities in Ohio tend to be reactive in dealing with circuit problems, Banton said. Communities can face longer outages if utilities wait for equipment to fail before replacing it. Instead, Banton wants utilities’ capital investments to address current disparities and then prevent them from recurring in the future.
“The bottom line is that consumers should get reliable service, and utilities are obligated to provide reliable service,” said Merrilee Embs, a spokesperson for the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, which did not work on the report. The group is concerned about whether utilities’ capital improvement spending directly benefits customers — an issue that relates to grid disparities.
“FirstEnergy’s (and other Ohio utilities’) failure to implement grid modernization plans in a way that benefits residential consumers likely contributes to grid disparities such as those described in the [study],” Embs wrote via email after reviewing the report.
FirstEnergy has challenged the Ohio Environmental Council’s objections about grid disparities in its rate case. Meanwhile, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is due to consider revisions to the annual reliability reporting requirements by Sept. 30, 2026. The commission will likely start accepting comments on the rules later this year, said spokesperson Matt Schilling.

 How the local grid impacts clean energy and economic development

The quality of a neighborhood’s grid influences more than whether residents’ lights stay on.
“These inequities can have serious consequences for customer access to distributed energy resources, which can save money,” said Karin Nordstrom, a lawyer for the Ohio Environmental Council.
Rooftop solar or other distributed clean energy can add to traffic on local grid circuits, posing a challenge for equipment that’s older or has lower voltages or capacity. Those circuits generally can handle less grid traffic, Banton said. In contrast, newer, high-voltage circuits tend to have ​“less bumps and less potholes [along with] better on-ramps.”
The grid’s quality and capacity also impact an area’s economic development. Historically, utilities have focused capital investment on places where people are moving or where they expect new industrial demand. That approach exacerbates inequity, Banton said. Even if businesses otherwise wanted to move to disadvantaged areas, poor electrical infrastructure may lead them to go elsewhere to avoid huge costs for upgrading the local grid, they said.
“The energy transition is in full effect, but many of the communities that suffer first and worst from climate change are not able to make the transition due to underinvestment in infrastructure,” said Tony Reames, a professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability, who did not work on the new report. He served at the U.S. Department of Energy as deputy director for energy justice and principal deputy director for state and community energy programs during the Biden administration.
Because utilities have failed to invest in and maintain the grid evenly throughout their service territories, an equity-based approach to infrastructure modernization should make sure resources now go to areas that were left behind, Reames said.
He supports the report’s call for more granular data, including details on customers with repeated or prolonged outages. The report also calls on utilities to publish maps showing grid capacity, and information about which census tracts are served by each circuit and substation transformers.
“I often say, ​‘The data you don’t have is the problem you don’t see,’” Reames noted. ​“Difficulties accessing data or the lack of certain data availability are sometimes a result of entities not wanting to confirm issues that are anecdotally known.”

On YouTube, I found a video covering the shooting with three times as many views as any other reporting. As of Friday, the video has 128,000 views. 
The 13-minute video, titled “Murder of Kansas Priest Shows Growing Threat to Churches: Why Kansas Churches Should be on Alert” was posted on the Christian Warrior channel on YouTube. 
The channel, created and hosted by former police officer Keith Graves, has more than 180 other videos. While some videos describe recommended training for church security teams, others focus on recent violence at churches across America.
“Gunshot Victim Hides in Church During Gathering”
“Church Security Volunteer Dies Shielding Kids from Gunfire”
“How to Protect Your Church From Imminent Terror Attacks”
The channel’s description reads, “If you love Jesus and you love guns, you’re in the right place. The Christian Warrior is focused on giving you the knowledge and skills to protect your church. We do this by giving you shooting drills, qualification standards and training ideas.”
As I prepared to interview Graves this week, I reflected on how these words create vertigo when set next to my life in Christian churches. Warrior? Guns? Shooting Drills? Training? I wondered whether Graves’s reaction was another sprouting of aggressive American gun culture. 
I braced for him to lecture me on right-wing conspiracy theories and the virtues of concealed carry.
The conversation was something else entirely.
*
My childhood was spent in the white-walled sanctuaries of Presbyterian churches in Pennsylvania and suburban Chicago. My sister and mom in matching seersucker dresses with ruffles. My mustached dad in a suit with a starched white button-down collar. The gentle melody of an Easter hymn wafting out the windows on a spring Sunday morning.
In the dark-wood pews of those churches, my biggest worries were whether I was singing in tune and whether I could keep from fidgeting during the epic sermon.    
With that experience in my rearview mirror, I felt a clash of worldviews with Graves’s security stance in his Seneca video and elsewhere on his channel. 
“Churches have to remain spiritually grounded while also elevating their tactical awareness,” Graves says near the end of the Seneca video. 
He advises parishioners to find a local police officer, an ally on the inside who will give the honest truth about what is happening in town. The implication? There might be something dangerous hidden from your church. 
Coupled with the imagery of guns on almost every YouTube preview, the alarm that I sensed as coming from Graves is foreign to my Sundays at church.
His warnings about church security in Kansas were also disturbing.  
“There is a lot of crime against Catholic churches in Kansas specifically over the past month,” Graves said. “And if you are in the Kansas area, you need to know about it. This is what my contacts are telling me.” 
He described recent vandalism at a Catholic church in Wichita and the protest at the Kansas statehouse by satanists, which led to arrests. 
In the video, Graves continued: “Officers in the area are watching these patterns carefully. It’s possible that this recent murder is connected to the escalating anti-Christian trends. But we don’t have a motive confirmed yet.” 
Should we be as concerned as Graves, I wondered, or is this a moral panic fueled by his reaction to headlines about church violence? After all, every kind of apocalyptic news travels easily into our social media feeds.
*
Graves started his Christian Warrior YouTube channel after he retired after years of law enforcement work in Oakland and Berkeley, California. 
“I could not do any of this until I retired,” Graces told me in our interview. Because cops don’t have a First Amendment right. We can’t speak publicly about anything.”
Since then, his videos (with 139,000 YouTube subscribers) and weekly newsletter (with 40,000 subscribers, he said) have documented church violence, along with security tips to prevent it. Alerts to his inbox arrive each morning after crawling the web for keywords like “Church shooting” or “Church stabbing.”  
“Obviously, the violent things that happen at churches are the ones that get views,” Graves said. “And I hate that. I absolutely hate it.”
Since starting the channel, Graves said he has mostly moved away from his previous consulting as a speaker on narcotics law enforcement. Now, from his home in Idaho, he records himself, microphone in the foreground and framed firearms in the background. 
He uses a social media forum, with 50,000 certified law enforcement officials in it, to research the latest church crimes. He would not share the social media platform during our interview. 
“I will pray before I do every video,” Graves said. “And pray that I say the right things, because I don’t want to cause panic, right? 
Graves sees the world as a precarious place for Christians in 2025 — the most dangerous atmosphere for Christians in modern American history. 
“I do think that there is a cultural movement to have some hate against Christians. Then you look at the Christian faith, you see less and less people coming to church over the last couple decades for sure.”
Graves said that he monitors terrorist chats online, and that he’s “never seen them be so fervent about their hate towards Christians when you look at the jihadi side.” 
He compares the level of threat to America before the attacks of September 11, 2001, and worries about attacks coordinated by ISIS and Al-Queda.  
Graves connects the hostility that he sees toward police officers and Christians. 
“Being a police officer, I know there are people that dislike me so much they would love to kill me,” Graves said. “But there are people that hate Christians and Jews so much that they would like to see you dead. And I don’t think people have ever thought about that before, because they just lived a fortunate life.”
The dire tone is hard to square in some ways with the cultural and political power that Christians hold in America. Graves sees the atmosphere as nonetheless threatening.
I told Graves how including “warrior” sounds a lot like vigilantism to me. I explained my worry of Christian militias seeking justice in the name of church security, armed with guns and tactical vests. 
“You’re trying to make the name ‘warrior’ this bad name,” Graves said. “People have been using (the word) ‘sheepdog’ forever in the church security field. And I’m like, I’m not a sheepdog. I’m a warrior. I’m here to protect my people. I’m here to keep evil away from them. And warrior isn’t a bad name. I’m a Christian, I’m a warrior, and I’m here to protect the people that are within the church. Does that mean I’m going to go on the offense and start hurting people? Absolutely not.”
“True vigilantism, taking the law into your own hands, we all know it’s wrong, right?” he continued. “It’s biblically wrong. It’s criminally wrong. There’s everything wrong about it. I don’t know why anybody would want to go that route to begin with. It firmly goes against scripture.” 
*
Halfway through the interview, Graves and I circled back to my central question: Is his YouTube channel addressing a substantial threat to religious people in America or is it overreacting to shocking headlines?
“Here’s the problem, if you don’t report (on church violence), then people continue thinking that there’s not going to be a problem,” he said, adding: “You just have to look at what’s happening and realize that it’s a possibility. You just have to realize it’s minimal. It’s just not zero.”
It took me that long to remember that my family is proof that the threat is not zero. 
Eleven years and one week ago, my wife and two children were barricaded in a bathroom at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City. My 9-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son were still wet from their swimming lessons with friends. 
Staff from the community center ordered them into the women’s locker room. The lockdown kept them there for more than an hour. Outside, an anti-semetic gunman killed a grandfather and his grandson in the parking lot of the facility before killing another woman at a nearby retirement community.
What if the Christian Warrior channel had existed in 2014? Would it have helped to have Graves’s review of the shooting and the law enforcement response?
I’ve thought about that all day — whether these Christian Warrior videos scoot us closer to being a more secure land of churches with well-trained security teams. Or whether they turn up the flame of panic and militarism under an already boiling pot.

The Trump administration has recently revoked the visas of more than 1,300 foreign college students  – detaining some – and launched immigration enforcement actions on college campuses across the country. This has raised concerns among the more than 1.1 million international students studying at U.S. universities.
Headlines are filled with perspectives from immigration and civil rights experts, but one aspect of the story often goes overlooked: the tremendous economic impact international students have on local communities.
Although the actual impact on enrollment won’t be known until the next academic year, interest from foreign students in pursuing graduate-level education in the U.S. fell sharply in the early days of the Trump administration, one analysis showed.
If these global scholars stay home, that’s bad economic news for cities and towns across the United States.
 A $44 billion economic impact

Higher education is America’s 10th-largest export, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. (Yes, even though students are coming into the U.S. for their education, economists consider it an export.)
Last year, U.S. colleges and universities attracted international students from 217 nations and territories, including one student from the island nation of Niue in the South Pacific. Their economic contributions added up to more than the value of U.S. telecommunications, computer and information services exports combined.
While the national impact is impressive, the effects at the local level are even more important. After all, nearly every city across the U.S. has at least one institution of higher learning.
The average international student brings a wallet stuffed with about $29,000 to spend on everything from tuition to pizza. As these students rent apartments, buy books and order DoorDash delivery to fuel all-nighters, they’re pumping money into the local community.
This money translates into American jobs. On average, a new job is created for every four international students enrolled in a U.S. college or university. In the 2023-24 academic year, about 378,175 jobs were created. And that’s just counting jobs that are directly supported by international students, such as local business hiring to staff retail shops and restaurants. If you count those jobs indirectly supported by international students, such as employees at a distribution center, the number is even higher.
 A boon to local economies

In any of the 50 largest American cities, you’ll find at least one college or university with international students on campus. For these communities, global learners bring a most welcome financial aid package.
Consider Boston. Greater Boston hosts more than 50 colleges and universities, including Boston University, where I teach multinational finance and trade. The city’s economic gains from the more than 63,000 international students attending these schools are huge: about $3 billion.
Prestigious private schools are a draw, but hands down the biggest pull for international students are state universities and colleges. Of the nation’s top schools enrolling these students last year, 29 were state colleges and universities, attracting over 251,300 students.
In the top three of those public institutions alone − Arizona State University, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of California, Berkeley − international students contributed nearly $1.7 billion, supporting over 16,800 jobs. Expand that to the top 10 − the University of California system takes four of those spots − and the numbers pop up to $4.68 billion and 47,136 jobs.
 Bringing the world to Mankato

Yet international students aren’t just boosting the economies of major university towns. Consider Mankato, a small city of 45,000 about 80 miles from Minneapolis that hosts a Minnesota State University campus. In the 2023-24 academic year, about 1,716 international students called Mankato their home away from home.
Those students brought an infusion of $45.9 million into that community, supporting around 190 jobs. There are dozens of similar campuses in cities and towns like Mankato across the country. It adds up quickly.
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
In addition to private and public universities, community colleges attract thousands of global scholars. Although their international enrollment declined during Covid-19, community colleges are resurgent, attracting some 59,315 international students in 2024, with China, Vietnam and Nepal leading the countries-of-origin list.
Generating about $2 billion and supporting 8,472 jobs, they have a major economic impact − particularly in Texas, California and Florida, where the majority of these students come to learn.
Texas leads the nation with the three community colleges with the largest international enrollment: Houston Community College, Lone Star College and Dallas College. Of the $256.7 million and 1,096 jobs international students brought into those institutions, Lone Star led the pack with $102.3 million and 438 jobs, nearly one job created for every two international students − double the national average.
Due to changing demographics, American colleges enroll 2.3 million fewer domestic students than they did a decade ago − a decline of 10.7%. Colleges and universities are increasingly looking to international students to fill the gap. What’s more, universities tend to see international students as subsidizing domestic students, particularly since international students are generally ineligible for need-blind admissions.
Moreover, the vast majority of international students are funded by family or foreign sponsors. Few require student aid packages. In fact, less than 20% of all international students receive grant funding from a federal source, and most of that goes to postgraduates doing advanced research. If you look at undergraduate exchange students alone, just 0.1% receive any sort of public funding.
One thing’s for sure: Whether they’re attending small-town community colleges or the Ivies in big cities, international students bring a “high degree” of economic impact with them.

As Republicans in Congress consider cutting the federal share of Medicaid funding, states are weighing numerous options to scale back their programs. But voters in three states have significantly limited those options by enshrining Medicaid expansion in their constitutions — creating a potential budget disaster and a political challenge for the GOP.
Over the past several years, voters in conservative Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have amended their state constitutions to require their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the age of 65 who earn equal to or less than 138% of the federal poverty level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Those states are among the 40 plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost.
But much of that federal funding could soon vanish. Republicans in Congress are debating several options to achieve $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. One proposal would slash the 90% rate to the lower match rates states get for the traditional Medicaid population, mainly children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Those percentages range from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
If Congress goes that route, states would have to come up with $626 billion over the next decade to keep the roughly 20 million people in the expansion population on the rolls.
Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have laws on the books that would automatically roll back Medicaid expansion if the federal funds dip. Some states are considering requiring people to work, go to school or volunteer in order to receive Medicaid benefits, a condition that would trim the rolls and save money.
But because Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have put Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, they can’t easily take those steps.
Republicans in Congress are eyeing cuts to Medicaid. But what does Medicaid actually do?

“Legislators cannot change that law without going back to voters for a whole other campaign to change the constitution,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit that helped put the constitutional amendments on the ballot in all three states.
“Even if the federal government cuts their contribution towards funding Medicaid expansion, those three states do not have the option to reduce eligibility or benefits for the Medicaid expansion population,” she told Stateline. “They will have to find those resources.”
Medicaid is a huge component of state budgets. Including the federal matching money, states spend an average of nearly a third of their budgets on Medicaid. And the program is also the single largest source of federal funds for states.
Missourians voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid in August 2020. When state lawmakers refused to fund the expansion, residents sued the state’s Department of Social Services. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had to find the resources for Medicaid expansion — a huge win for progressives.
For 2025, Missouri allotted $18.2 billion for Medicaid, with the federal government covering $12.7 billion of that, or about 70%. If Congress cuts the federal share of Medicaid funding by $880 billion over the next decade, it would leave Missouri with a budget hole of around $1.7 billion next year, according to research from nonprofit group the Commonwealth Fund. That would force the state to come up with some options to avoid fiscal disaster.
Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, told Stateline that these include raising taxes, cutting enrollment for other Medicaid populations, diminishing reimbursements to providers, getting rid of optional medical services such as dental care or ceasing payments for equipment like wheelchairs.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Raising taxes is not a likely or popular choice in Republican-leaning Missouri, McBride noted, while adding that cuts to providers would further endanger struggling hospitals.
“We lost 10 hospitals in Missouri in the last few years. And if you start cutting their payment rates, that’s going to just put them at risk,” McBride said. “The real money is in the disabled and the elderly populations. And so if you really wanted to quote-unquote save money, that’s probably where you’d have to look. But that’s really controversial.”
The state budgetary implications of a potentially sharp decline in federal Medicaid funding have influenced some prominent opponents of Medicaid expansion to have a change of heart. U.S. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018 when he was Missouri’s attorney general. Now, Hawley has said he would refuse to vote for any Medicaid cuts.
“I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts, benefit cuts. Work requirements are fine. But 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. That’s a lot of people,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill in February.
Republicans in the closely divided U.S. Congress might have trouble pushing through Medicaid cuts if other conservative lawmakers from Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota follow Hawley’s lead.
Oklahoma voters expanded Medicaid via a constitutional amendment in 2020. South Dakota followed suit in 2022. Republicans in all three states want to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, but doing so would not save enough money to make up for the loss of federal dollars.
South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson said he respects that voters chose to expand Medicaid, and added that the state has “faithfully” implemented it. But the decision to amend the state constitution “can only be described as a foolish decision,” he said in an interview.










Now, as we're staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid … our state is hamstrung.


– South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson


“A constitution is not meant to be a flexible document that you change annually or even every other year,” Mortenson said. “And so now, as we’re staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid, including for the expansion population, our state is hamstrung in that we cannot effectively respond to those changes.”
Mortenson is one of the lead sponsors of a bill that would ask voters to consider a ballot measure in the next general election to amend the constitution again, this time conditioning Medicaid expansion on the level of federal assistance. The measure has passed both chambers of the legislature.
But some of the supporters of the original constitutional amendment say they would fight any attempt to change it. Any restrictions, including work requirements, would severely harm working-class people, said Doug Sombke, head of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Sombke told Stateline that most farmers in the state struggle to make ends meet and certainly cannot offer high wages or health care benefits to their workers.
“There’s just no extra income,” Sombke said. “And, in South Dakota, we’re a right-to-work state, so you can get fired for any reason. As a worker, you really don’t have a lot of choice.”
Hall, of the Fairness Project, said amending the constitution is the most effective way to expand Medicaid in states where conservative-leaning lawmakers have been reluctant to do so. She said she suspects that voters in other states might pursue the constitutional amendment strategy if their state lawmakers try to roll back expansion.
“I do think that it’s possible that if we see these cuts move forward in D.C., and states are making highly unpopular choices to cut benefits for people, that we will see this issue back at the ballot box,” Hall said. “But for right now, I would say we’re seeing the power of constitutional amendments to protect benefits in action in real time.”

(Stock.adobe.com image by s_l)As many as 109,000 Marylanders could get thrown off Medicaid if Congress follows through on a proposal to impose a work requirement for the coverage, according to a new report.
The report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation comes as some lawmakers are looking for ways to cut billions in federal spending in coming years. One proposal, to require that able-bodied adults work at least 2o hours a week to receive the benefits, would trim an estimated 7% of recipients — 109,000 people in Maryland, and about 5 million nationwide, the report estimates.
“That would be a significant amount of coverage lost,” said Katherine Hempstead, senior policy officer for Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. “And it would have really hard consequences for people who would lose their coverage.”
The study based its estimates on work requirement language in a 2023 bill, the Limit, Save, Grow Act, which would have required Medicaid recipients to work at least 80 hours a month unless they were exempt as a student, a family caregiver or because of a disability.
The report comes as House Republicans and the Trump administration l0ok to cut billions in federal spending over the next decade. The budget resolution recently adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, to cut $880 billion over 10 years.
Such reductions would likely require cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state health care plan for low-income residents – but exactly how those cuts would be implemented is yet to be decided. Work requirements is one of the options on the table, along with other measures to cut spending to Medicaid.
House Appropriations gets a crash course on potential Trump cuts to Medicaid

“There is this quest to find some budget cuts … Work requirements is one of the options that seems to gathering a little bit broader support than some of the others,” Hempstead said. She believes it’s important to know how work requirements could impact health care coverage, even if Congress decides not to add work requirements.
Proponents of work requirements say the policy would help move people into the workforce and help save taxpayer dollars.
The Foundation for Government Accountability, a conservative think-tank, said that work requirements “move millions of able-bodied adults from welfare to work,” in a post earlier this week.
“This, in turn, would save taxpayers billions of dollars, preserve resources for the truly needy, and put the Medicare and Social Security trust funds on more solid ground,” the foundation said.
House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in a February interview with CNN that the work requirements would not “cut benefits for people who rightly deserve” them.
“You don’t want able-bodied workers on a program that is intended, for example, for single mothers with two small children who is just trying to make it,” he said. “That’s what Medicaid is for – not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games. We’re going to find those guys and were going to send them back to work.”
But opponents of work requirements say that those policies do not reflect the challenges of finding work and proving eligibility to federal officials in order to keep coverage through Medicaid.
The report focused on states that have opted to increase Medicaid coverage through the Affordable Care Act expansion, which allows participating states to provide coverage for households that earn up to 138% of the federal poverty level income. Maryland is one of the 40 expansion states.
The report estimates that some 5 million people who live in those states could lose health care coverage if Congress imposes a work requirement to qualify for Medicaid. That would equate to about 6.9% of all 72 million people on Medicaid across the United States.

For Maryland, a work requirement could result in between 95,000 to 109,000 people losing coverage out of 1.5 million currently enrolled in Medicaid, according to the report.
The state with the largest raw number of people who could lose coverage would be California, with between 1 million to 1.2 million people affected out of the total 14 million current Medicaid recipients in the state. On the other end, between 5,000 and 6,000 of North Dakota’s 104,000 Medicaid recipients could lose coverage due to work requirements, according to the RWJF estimates.
But Hempstead also fears that work requirements will ultimately kick people off Medicaid who may still qualify for it. She said that people can often get caught up in the bureaucratic paperwork, which can be taxing for people who rely on Medicaid, as people have to prove whether they have work, are looking for work, or have a reason why they can’t work.
“Even if you accept the idea that people should have to work to get their health insurance,” she said, “what happens with work requirements is a lot of people lose coverage that are working — or are caregiving or are doing other things — and shouldn’t lose their coverage.”
Meanwhile, Hempstead noted the those who lose coverage due to work requirements would strain hospital systems, as uninsured people seek health care through other means, such as the emergency room or through charity care. That could exacerbate Maryland’s lengthy emergency room wait times, which are already some of the highest in the nation.
“There is a lot of spill-over into the health care system. As the uninsurance rate goes up and people don’t have health insurance, they try to ignore things and try to not get care. And sometimes things go away on their own and sometimes they don’t,” she said. “When things are really, really bad, they’ll go to the emergency room, where people will know that they will get treated.”
Ferguson warns of ‘Maryland recession’ as report says state has greatest risk from federal cuts

Benjamin Orr, executive director for Maryland Center on Economic Policy, said that work requirements are counterproductive and will take health insurance away from people who need it, regardless of employment.
“Our society does better when its members are healthy,” Orr said “The idea that we’re going to deny health coverage to 100,000 Marylanders or more is counterproductive to a healthy prosperous society.”
Orr also added that with talks of a looming recession, people are going to have a hard time finding jobs to fulfill work requirements to maintain health coverage. He noted that Maryland “is particularly susceptible to” layoffs in the federal government and other major institutions impacted by decisions from the Trump administration.
“It’s not a good time to be looking for a job, as we are on the cusp of a state-level recession, if not a national recession,” Orr said. “Even folks who might, otherwise in a healthy economy, be well positioned to find work may struggle to find work.”
Hempstead agrees that the work requirement logic is “backwards.”
“When people are healthy, they can work more,” she said. “It’s kind of a bad theory that you ought to be able to work in order to earn access to health care.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AdobeStock_167846258-1.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 03:03:08.027201

Mount and Presbury streets in Baltimore, where he was arrested 10 years ago. Spinal injuries during his arrest led to his death a week later, on April 19, 2015. (Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images)Melvin T. Russell, the retired chief of the Baltimore Police Community Division, said he remembers the lack of empathy among police commanders in the wake of Freddie Gray’s death after an arrest 10 years ago.
That’s when he knew “our city was really in trouble.”
“I didn’t see any remorse, there was no real concern within the department,” Russell said. “The concern didn’t come until finally there were the protests on a level that I had not seen in all my years in law enforcement.”
Russell’s comments came during a recent symposium to mark the 10th anniversary of Gray’s death in police custody, an incident that sparked protests followed by days of unrest, criminal charges and a reckoning for the city and its police department.
How much things have changed in the intervening 10 years depends on who is answering the question.
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott points to the statistics to buttress his argument that relations between the police and citizens have improved over the past decade.
“When you think about having 2.400-plus [civilian] complaints [in 2015] and now it’s down to 800, and 12 police-involved shootings now down to four,” Scott said.
“The clearance rate of homicides is also up, because people are talking to the police more,” he said, “but we still have a long way to go.”

Dayvon Love, director of public policy for the group Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, agrees that some progress has been made in police reform, but also that there are still shortcomings.
“Police investigatory records are now accessible to the public, there’s a change in use-of-force standard, so there are a bunch of things that have shifted the levers that the community has access to, including the police accountability boards,” Love said. “But I think the culture of the police department has not changed.”
Marvin “Doc” Cheatham vividly remembers the Sunday morning 10 years ago,
April 12, 2015, when his friend Freddie Gray was arrested in West Baltimore after a foot chase with police officers.
“You could hear him scream, and you can tell the difference between someone acting and someone actually in pain. He was actually in pain,” said Cheatham, president of the Matthew Henson Community Development Corp.
Cheatham describes Gray as “a jovial guy, but you knew he was up to something mischievous. He ran through the neighborhood selling drugs but was not a major drug dealer.”
Gray, who was 25, had been arrested 15 times in prior years on a variety of charges. After his arrest, captured on cell phone video by a nearby resident, police recovered a small knife. They cuffed him and placed him in the back of a police vam, but did not secure him with a seat belt – for the purpose of giving him what was later described in court testimony as a “rough ride,” where police attempt to bang up those arrested as they are tossed around in the back of the vehicle.
When police later checked on Gray, he was lying unconscious and was then transported to the Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center.
Gray died a week later, on April 19, 2015. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide, apparently from a spinal cord injury suffered inside the police van.
On the day Gray died, Russell recalls confronting angry protesters outside the Western Police District, some screaming, “Tell us why you killed Freddie.”
“I represented the police department, and at that moment, I thought I better have some answers,” Russell said.

Gray’s death sparked countless protests throughout the city. Days later, those protests erupted in violence that went on for days throughout the city, but concentrated in West Baltimore.
On Monday, April 27, dozens of police officers were pelted with rocks thrown by young people near Mondawmin Mall. A CVS store was set on fire at the corner of Pennsylvania and W. North avenues. Hundreds of locally owned businesses also were heavily damaged or destroyed.
For several days, a citywide curfew was imposed during overnight hours. More than 100 police officers were injured.
Four days later, then-Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced the indictments of six officers connected to Gray’s arrest, on a variety of charges. The announcement, televised live on Baltimore TV stations, was greeted with cheers and celebration by residents throughout the city.
“I think she [Mosby] saved our neighborhoods,” Cheatham said. “If she hadn’t had the police officers charged, you would have still had a neighborhood that was upset, and they probably would have done more damage.”
Ultimately, none of the six officers was convicted. A mistrial was declared in Officer William Porter’s case, and Officers Caesar Goodson Jr. and Edward Nero were acquitted of all charges.
In July, 2016, Mosby held a news conference in the West Baltimore neighborhood where Freddie Gray was arrested, and announced she was dropping all charges against three others: Lt. Brian Rice, Sgt. Alicia White and Officer Garrett Miller.
Eight years ago, U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar authorized a consent decree between the Justice Department and the Baltimore Police, which called for major reforms in the department.
Those changes include an overhaul in policies for transporting people in custody, including extensive training and upgrading vehicle equipment maintenance. Officers are now equipped with body cameras, and cameras have been installed in all police vans.

In a statement, Police Commissioner Richard Worley said, “The public has my full commitment that these changes reflect a true cultural shift within BPD, a fundamentally reformed agency that serves as a national model for reducing violent crime and upholding constitutional policing.”
But Baltimore Attorney William H. “Billy” Murphy Jr., who represents Gray’s family, says there is still a major problem with the department that impacts public safety.
“I’m very concerned that Baltimore does not have enough police officers,” Murphy said. “If he [Mayor Scott] has one problem with what’s going on, that’s it.”
A Baltimore Police spokesperson said there are currently about 500 vacancies for sworn officers and “the department has hired 70 new recruits since the start of 2025,” nearly double the number hired at this time last year.
In 2021, the General Assembly enacted legislation that transferred control of the Baltimore Police Department from the state to the city. Murphy said he hopes the change will let the mayor will take an active role to implement major changes in the department by removing corrupt officers to enhance public confidence.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), right, meets with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident who was erroneously deported to El Salvador by ICE agents last month. (Photo courtesy Sen. Van Hollen)Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) was finally able to meet Thursday night with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Beltsville resident who was erroneously deported last month to his native El Salvador, where he has been held incommunicado in that country’s megaprison for terrorists.
The meeting followed two days of attempts by Van Hollen to see Abrego Garcia, including an attempt earlier Thursday when soldiers turned away him and Chris Newman — the lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s wife and his mother — at a checkpoint about 3 kilometers away from the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, where Abrego Garcia is being held.
Van Hollen said that while the soldiers allowed other cars to pass, they said they had “been ordered not to allow us to proceed any further than that point.”
It is unclear what led to the the change in policy, but Van Hollen posted a photo on social media after 9 p.m. Thursday of him talking with Abrego Garcia.
“I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance,” Van Hollen said in his post. “I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.”
Abrego Garcia, seen in the photos in jeans, a checkered shirt and a Kansas City Chiefs ballcap, appears healthy. It was a different look than the shaved heads, baggy white shorts and T-shirts and Crocs or sandals that CECOT inmates are wearing in most photos of the facility.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who insisted during a White House meeting Monday with President Donald Trump that his country had no intention of releasing Abrego Garcia, trolled Van Hollen with his own social media posts of the meeting shortly before the senator’s Thursday. Bukele mockingly referred to Abrego Garcia “miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture,’ now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador.”
“Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody,” Bukele posted.
Van Hollen unsuccessfully sought a meeting when Bukele was in Washington, and again when he traveled to El Salvador Wednesday. He was able to meet instead with Salvadoran Vice President Félix Ulloa, who denied his requests Wednesday to either visit or speak on the phone with Abrego Garcia.
The Maryland Democrat arrived in the Central American country Wednesday in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia, whom the Justice Department admitted in court was deported in error, back to the United States, or at least check on his wellness.
A U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 allowing Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant in the U,S., to daus here because sending him back to his home country would put him in grave danger from gangs there that he said caused him to flee in the first place.
Van Hollen said that since Abrego Garcia was sent to CECOT, he had not spoken with anyone outside of the prison walls until their meeting Thursday. “This inability to communicate with his lawyers is a violation of international law,” Van Hollen had said earlier Thursday.
The senator pointed out that El Salvador is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
“That covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,’” he said.
Van Hollen also said he met with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and they discussed “the full range of important bilateral relations between the United States and El Salvador.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other Republicans have criticized Van Hollen for making the trip, repeating the accusation that Abrego Garcia is a gang member.
Representatives for the White House and DHS did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.
Appeals court slams administration’s inaction
Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s case continues to work its way through U.S. courts as a flashpoint conflict between two branches of government that has led to the precipice of a constitutional crisis.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
On Thursday, a federal appeals court panel dismantled the administration’s latest appeal, saying the government had done “essentially nothing” to attempt to return Abrego Garcia in compliance with last week’s Supreme Court order.
A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said the executive branch was due deference in conducting foreign policy, but that the administration’s inaction in seeking Abrego Garcia’s return amounted to defiance of a judicial order.
The unanimous ruling was written by 4th Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan. The other two judges, Robert Bruce King and Stephanie Thacker, were nominated by Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done,” the panel wrote. “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”
The appeals ruling responded to the government’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ order this week for the Trump administration to offer evidence on how it has sought to help with Abrego Garcia’s release from CECOT.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” — but stopped short of requiring — his return to the United States.
In unusually frank language, the 4th Circuit panel warned Thursday the conflict between the executive and judicial branches threatened the foundation of U.S. government.
“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” the court asked. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present.”
Near the end of the order, the panel urged the administration to obey the judicial branch.
“We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos,” the judges wrote. “This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.”
Neither country taking action
The 4th Circuit panel pointed out that the leaders of both the United States and El Salvador claimed they had no power to return Abrego Garcia.
“We are told that neither government has the power to act,” they wrote. “The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.”
During a White House visit this week, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he would not bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.
The Trump administration has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error.” The administration continues to accuse him of being part of the gang MS-13, despite no charges or convictions of any criminal offenses against him, including gang-related crimes.

That’s not a culture war —it’s a takeover.","Harvard University —long a symbol of academic independence— now faces a defining test in refusing President Donald Trump’s demands for federal intrusion into academia. Vulnerable Connecticut colleges and universities include Yale, Wesleyan, the University of Connecticut and its health center-medical school with Jackson Laboratories. 
Who’s next? Trump may be just getting started.
President Trump and his allies, under the guise of fighting antisemitism, are advancing a broader campaign for political and ideological control over higher education.
If Harvard had surrendered to growing demands from President Donald Trump and his allies —demands cloaked in concern about antisemitism, but driven by broader ambitions of political control— the university risked more than just its reputation.
Standing up to fight, it may lose up to $9 billion in research and other funding, with $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60 million in contracts already halted for refusing to play ball with Trump.
These institutions aren’t apprentices in the education market—but Trump’s plan is to bully and humiliate them into submission, just like on his caustic reality TV show by the same name.
The problem? He’s not playing with TV contestants this time. He’s playing with millions of students’ futures—students who need serious, grounded education to survive in today’s volatile economy.
Further, Harvard refused to risk compromising the very idea of what a university should be. Columbia University should have stood up earlier rather than set a tone for sacrificing integrity and academic freedom by conceding to demands when threatened with a $400 million loss.
Princeton, Stanford and Yale are among the growing list of universities standing with Harvard now.
Today, it’s research grants. Tomorrow, it could be federal financial aid —jeopardizing access for students whose futures depend on it. The administration’s tactic is clear: Use funding as leverage to force ideological compliance.
If Trump, the founder of the failed Trump University, succeeds in repurposing real universities and colleges to serve political ends, the light of free inquiry dims. That’s not a culture war—it’s a takeover.
As a Harvard Kennedy School graduate approaching my 40th reunion, I reflect on what we learned: to think critically, argue thoughtfully, and grow through discomfort. We weren’t told what to believe—we were taught how to reason.
That education wasn’t just academic —it was also moral. It prepared us to serve the public interest with clarity, conscience, and courage. In a noisy world, we were taught to anchor ourselves to facts, reason and empathy.
That approach remains vital today—not just at Harvard, but nationwide. As a professor for nearly 40 years at the University of Hartford and over a decade at Manchester (CT) Community College, I know what’s at stake.
And I believe Harvard is right to tell the government: This line we do not cross.
Here’s why:
Repel political pressure. By surrendering to political pressure, universities risk losing the very essence of what makes them vital to democracy: independence of thought.
Across the country, and now with Harvard in the spotlight, higher education is being tested. If universities begin removing leaders, rewriting policy, or silencing dissent in response to political outrage —particularly from figures like Donald Trump— they aren’t reforming. They’re yielding. Governance should rest with faculty senates, trustees, and shared academic principles—not with any political rally, social media campaign, or Oval Office demand.
Wrenching weaponization. One especially troubling tactic is the broad weaponization of antisemitism allegations. Antisemitism must be called out, always. But branding all criticism of Israel or support for Palestinian rights as antisemitic forces institutions into a false choice between integrity and appeasement. The result? Dissenting voices—especially those of students and faculty—go quiet, not because they’re wrong, but because they’re risky.
Contagious chilling effect. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs—already under political attack—are essential to opening access and deepening learning. Gutting them to avoid headlines sends a dangerous message: that inclusion and equity are optional, expendable under pressure. And when research must stay inside “safe” ideological lines, academic inquiry narrows. Big questions go unasked. Truth is buried—not because it’s false, but because it’s inconvenient.
Disappearing donors. The influence of major donors, many of whom are now responding to specific political concerns such as pro-Palestinian protest, has only compounded the problem. Institutions that allow funding to dictate principle trade their mission for money. Academic freedom can’t survive in an environment where every dollar comes with a litmus test.
This is not just a Harvard issue. It’s not even just a Trump issue. It’s everyone’s issue who values education.
It’s a warning about precedent. What happens at one elite institution shapes many others, whether private or public, small or large. Today, the targets are Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and Middle East discourse. Tomorrow, it could be climate science, abortion, or how U.S. history is taught.
Higher education doesn’t exist to echo power. It exists to question it. If we care about the survival of free inquiry and democratic thought, the line must be held—right now.
It is worth the time for anyone caring about education’s promise, and every university and college administrator, professor, staff member and student to read Harvard’s response for protecting the line.
“We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement. The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Harvard President Alan M. Garber wrote in announcing the decision to fight back.
The administration’s actions overstep federal authority, violating Harvard’s First Amendment rights and exceeding Title VI limits. They also undermine the core values of private universities: the freedom to decide what to teach, who to admit and hire, and which areas of inquiry to pursue—free from government control, regardless of political party, he said.
“Our motto—Veritas, or truth—guides us as we navigate the challenging path ahead. Seeking truth is a journey without end. It requires us to be open to new information and different perspectives, to subject our beliefs to ongoing scrutiny, and to be ready to change our minds. It compels us to take up the difficult work of acknowledging our flaws so that we might realize the full promise of the University, especially when that promise is threatened,” Garber wrote.
Take heed parents, students, and other universities and colleges.
You might be next facing Trump demands.

For some, it means access to the best doctors and hospitals. For others, it means a courageous battle against a chronic, and perhaps incurable disease. And for many, it means struggling with how to pay their bills.
Connecticut has been a leader in helping residents deal with medical debt.  Late last year, Gov. Ned Lamont announced a program that utilized funds from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to eliminate $30 million in medical debt for 23,000 Connecticut residents.
While that pennies on the dollar approach was great news for those residents, at the time, state Sen. Saud Anwar (D-Windsor), co-chair of the public health committee,made an excellent point:  Connecticut needs to do more to prevent high healthcare costs for residents in the first place.
Unfortunately, a program that already exists at the federal level, designed to lower drug costs and improve access to medication for low-income Americans, has been corrupted.
The 340B federal drug discount program was created in 1992 and is the second largest drug program in the country. It was designed to help reduce the financial burden of accessing medication for the uninsured and under-insured. However, the system has been misused; 340B has morphed into a way for large tax-exempt hospitals and for-profit chain pharmacies to markup medicine prices and boost their profits.
While some 340B participants, such as community health centers and other safety-net clinics, reinvest income from the 340B program back into patient care as required by federal law, other program participants lack transparency into how, or if, savings are helping low-income patients.
In this program, manufacturers sell drugs to 340B hospitals at deeply discounted prices. The hospitals then contract with pharmacies to dispense those medicines. The intent was that the contracted pharmacies would be in low resource areas and pass along the discounts to their uninsured and under-insured consumer base. There is little evidence, however, that this program is operating in the manner it was designed.In fact, a comprehensive analysis found that most patients received “zero or close to zero” discount on the price of their drugs even though those treatments were purchased at steep discounts through the 340B program.  In 2022 alone, hospitals and big chain pharmacies pocketed more than $50 billion in discounts that were intended for patients.

From IQVIA fact sheet on its 340B study, Credit: IQVIA fact sheet
Because of a lack of oversight and transparency within the 340B program, hospitals have gotten away contracting primarily with big chain pharmacies in  wealthier, whiter neighborhoods and out of state, where customers have private insurance and pay full price.
In Connecticut,60 percent of 340B pharmacies that are supposed to be serving the low-income population are instead located in affluent neighborhoods. Furthermore, 139 pharmacies, roughly 30 percent of the total number of pharmacies, are located outside of Connecticut, with some as far away as Texas. This begs the question – how does that help our residents? To put it simply, it does not.
It is time to ensure that this gaming of the system stops and that those who the program was intended to help, are indeed being supported. As a federal program, legislation can only occur at the federal level to address these issues.
That is why Connecticut lawmakers should reject the 340B provisions in SB11—a wide ranging bill that will do nothing to help patient costs but could exacerbate the already bloated issues within 340B.
Our Congressional lawmakers need to lead this charge and increase regulations on 340B contracts.
Any fix must include stipulations as to how and where the discounted drugs can be sold and to whom. There needs to be more transparency and accountability down the distribution chain so that our most vulnerable populations are able to get the medications they need at the cost they can afford.
The 340B programhas the unique opportunity to advance health equity by supporting safety-net providers in underserved communities, but misguided eligibility standards and loopholes have 340B hospitals and their associated pharmacies to prioritize profits over patients. It’s time for that to change.

But only if we act now.  CT can’t wait for Washington, and our residents can’t wait for care.","When it comes to Connecticut’s health care system, there’s one truth our state leaders can’t afford to ignore: Care at come is among the most cost effective, compassionate, and sustainable services within our broader public health landscape. 
Helping Connecticut residents receive care at home reduces hospital admissions, prevents costly complications, and ensures continuity of care over time. By reaching people where they live, we help close gaps in access and save the state millions of dollars, especially for our most vulnerable populations.

Ann Olson and Bree Sanca
“Care at home” refers to the full spectrum of home-based services in Connecticut, including skilled medical home health, non-medical homemaker-companion care, and end-of-life hospice care.  Together, these services allow individuals to recover, remain independent, and age with dignity in their own homes, surrounded by family and familiar comforts.
However, despite these benefits and despite the thousands of state residents currently relying on care at home, our state now finds itself at a crossroads of inaction. The reason is simple: while there is strong support to invest in care at home, some leaders in Hartford are hesitant to act due to the current uncertainty at the federal level regarding health care funding. While these lawmakers may be well-intentioned (hoping to understand the federal impact on our state system before making decisions), waiting to act would push Connecticut further into to a crisis.
Here’s the reality: Medicaid-supported personal care at home costs the state far less than institutional care. Caring for an individual at home costs roughly $3,300 per month ($55/day). Compare that to nearly $10,000 per month in a nursing home facility. That’s a savings of nearly $80,000 a year per person. Home-based care isn’t just more dignified; it’s more fiscally responsible.
Skilled care at home offers even more cost savings to the state.  Two striking examples are:

Behavioral health nursing visits to ensure those with mental illness or substance- abuse disorder are taking their medications and stable in the community—average cost per day for community care is $100 versus $1,000 per day for a hospital stay.
Complex care nursing is another critical care-at-home service for children and adults who have medically complex conditions requiring highly skilled, in-home nursing care (feeding tubes and tracheostomy tubes or ventilators to help them breathe, live, and grow safely in their homes with their families). Average cost for care at home is $1,000/day vs average cost for institutional care is $10,000/day.

And yet, Connecticut’s care at home programs and services are hanging by a thread. Many Medicaid care-at-home rates have not been adjusted since 2007. In addition, we are losing workforce because neighboring states—Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York— are all offering significantly higher rates, drawing caregivers across state lines.
Lack of workforce and inadequate reimbursement rates means fewer options for families, fewer workers to care for the elderly and people with disabilities, and more clients stuck in hospitals or moved to nursing facilities, costing the state and taxpayers more money. It also means devastating consequences for the thousands of workers—predominantly women and people of color —who rely on this profession to support their own families.
Studies show that delivering care at home reduces unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency visits, helping individuals stay healthier while saving the state millions.  Investing in care at home is the smart thing to do – economically, socially, and morally.
In this context, waiting for Washington is not a strategy. It’s a dangerous gamble —and the odds are stacked against the people who need care and the workers who provide it. If state leaders fail to act now, they will be part of the problem for not tackling a solution.
We don’t need to look to Washington for answers—we already have them. The answer is simple. Implement the following rate increases now: 13% for personal care services and a 10% for skilled home health, followed by 10% annual increases over the next three years to catch up with inflation. These are not extravagant requests. They are critical to preserving a care model that works for Connecticut economically, socially, and morally.
Making these changes is not only in the best interest of state residents and workers, it will also help insulate us from potential federal cuts. If federal cuts come to fruition, Connecticut’s ability to care for its most vulnerable residents will depend on the strength of our home care system. These services are the backbone of our health care infrastructure, quietly delivering consistent, high-quality care that keeps people out of hospitals and nursing homes.
By investing now, we create a resilient system that can absorb future shocks and continue delivering essential care when other parts of the safety net are strained.
If state leaders are serious about fiscal responsibility, economic equity, and preserving care that works, the time to act is now. Because when the federal cuts come —and they likely will —Connecticut won’t have the luxury to scramble. If we don’t invest now, we won’t have a workforce left to provide the most cost-effective care we have.
Care at home is not a problem to be solved, it’s the solution. But only if we choose to act now.  Connecticut can’t wait for Washington, and our residents can’t wait for care.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Along with announced a veto of an education funding bill on Thursday, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy introduced new legislation with a lower per student funding boost, plus additional funding and policy items focused on charter schools and homeschool programs.
Dunleavy held a news conference at the Alaska State Capitol on Thursday, saying there were two reasons for the veto.
“One of the reasons is that the revenue situation has deteriorated a lot since we submitted the bills and worked off the budget in December,” Dunleavy said. “And the second reason for the veto is there’s no policy with this.”
Last week, the Legislature passed a stripped-down version of House Bill 69, taking out all policy items, and putting forward a simple two-line version that increased the base student allocation — the core of the funding formula — by $1,000 in the funding formula. The bill originally was focused solely on a funding increase, and legislators had added some policy changes sought by the governor, only to remove those proposals after he continued to criticize the different versions of the bill for falling short.
Dunleavy had called the move a “joke” and promised to veto the bill. On Thursday, with the veto announcement, he urged legislators to reconsider his policy proposals to advance school funding this session. 
“We still have 34 days left in the session. We still have plenty of time to get a bill passed,” he said. “We know what the policies are. We know how to get to the end game here.”
The governor’s new proposed bill includes a $560 increase for the base student allocation, plus another $35 million per year in “targeted investments” for specific programs, resulting in what the governor’s office calls a “BSA equivalent” of $700.
However, that would result in a year-over-year decrease in the BSA because last year’s budget included a one-time funding bonus equivalent to a BSA boost of $680.
The governor’s policy proposals includes $13.6 million to fund homeschool students at the same level as the core BSA amount for students in brick-and-mortar schools; the state currently funds homeschooling at 90% of the BSA. In addition, Dunleavy proposed $21.9 million in incentive grants aimed at improving reading proficiency, an expansion of the application and appeals process for charter schools, and statewide open enrollment, which would allow families to choose which school students attend.
“This is a bill that, if agreed upon by the Legislature, I’ll sign tomorrow morning. I’ll sign Monday. I’ll sign Tuesday … because it will have policies in there,” Dunleavy said. “We support funding, but we’re not going to support a very large, unbalanced, one-sided coin that is just funding, when we have opportunities to improve educational outcomes.” 
Now, the 60 members of the House and Senate are headed to a joint session where they could override the veto. 
Overriding the veto would require votes from 40 of 60 legislators. Last year, the Legislature failed by one vote. This year, multiple legislators said there are unlikely to be 40 votes for an override. The House and Senate passed HB 69 with a combined 32 votes.
A joint session to vote on the veto override is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, April 22. 
“You simply never know,” House Speaker Bryce Edmon, I-Dillingham, told reporters on Thursday of the veto override vote, adding that school districts are in crisis. “We have heard time and again this session, (from) schools that are beyond their capabilities of any reserves that they had. Our public school system in Alaska is in crisis, and that’s something that we need to focus on.” 
Edgmon said the House majority caucus is open to negotiate with Dunleavy and consider his policy proposals, but he’s concerned it doesn’t address the state of schools now, some facing major deficits and budget shortfalls. 
“What happens if that gap isn’t met this year? What transpires in year two or three or four?” Edgmon said, adding that this question is particularly important for districts that are struggling to keep schools open. “And I didn’t hear a clear answer from the governor, and that concerned me.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXWith 34 days left in the session, Edgmon said the funding boost is a major priority. “It’s going to be a heavy lift, but we’re up for it, and we’re going to do everything we can,” he said. “And we ask our school districts to be patient, to know that we’re doing our best.”
Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, who sponsored the bill, also urged the veto override. 
“Honestly, the $1,000 BSA is what our districts need,” she said. “They need twice that. So to back away from the override vote, would I think be the wrong move at this point. We need to push for that override.”
Himschoot agreed there are areas in Dunleavy’s new legislation that could be negotiable. “There are some things there that we can definitely work with,” she said. “But the deal is not sealed in any way on that bill right now, I know that educators across the state are being laid off. We have school programs being cut. Once you cut it, you don’t necessarily get it back,” she said.
In an interview after the governor’s news conference, Himschoot pointed to a comment by Dunleavy. 
“One thing the governor said was we need to put our resources where the biggest problem is,” she said. “And the biggest problem our districts have right now is they’re either over a funding cliff or they will be next year…. right now, while we’re talking, they are going off the edge.”
Educators and advocates react to the veto
School district officials, students, parents and advocates have testified to lawmakers over weeks during the session that Alaska schools are in a financial crisis, and face steep cuts to programs, school closures and the loss of teachers and staff without the funding boost. Already, school districts have sent out hundreds of notices of potential layoffs, some accounting for a $680 to $1,000 per student increase. 
On Thursday, the state’s largest teachers’ union, NEA-Alaska, criticized the veto and urged an override. “To say I am disappointed Governor Dunleavy vetoed education funding is an understatement,” said Tom Klaameyer, NEA-Alaska president, in an emailed statement. “Unfortunately, it’s not surprising. We knew this Governor was going to play politics with Alaska students’ futures – and it’s disgraceful….  I urge every legislator to vote to override Governor Dunleavy’s veto and do the right thing for our kids.” 
Caroline Storm, executive director of the nonprofit Coalition for Education Equity, said in an interview Thursday that the group is preparing a lawsuit against the state saying that it is failing to maintain adequate schools, as required under the state constitution.
The group sued the state in 2004, in Moore vs. State of Alaska, where a judge ruled that the state was failing to support underperforming schools. Storm said today, the state is again not fulfilling its obligation, for both funding districts and adequately meeting education standards. 
“I know for a fact that there are several districts that are unable to even provide their students with elective opportunities, and those students have to do some other sort of correspondence course to get the requirements they need to graduate,” Storm said. “So if we’re not able to fund districts to the point where they can have a teacher present to offer those electives, or those art standards or anything, we’re not providing an adequate education.”
Budget still in flux 
Last year, legislators approved a one-time $680 boost to the BSA. That was worth roughly $174 million statewide. The increase proposed in HB 69 would have permanently increased that funding boost by $79 million, or $253 million statewide.
Anticipating Dunleavy’s veto, the Alaska House of Representatives voted to include a one-time, $1,000 BSA boost equivalent to HB 69 in the state’s draft operating budget.
It isn’t yet clear whether the Senate will affirm that increase, because the House’s draft budget also includes a major deficit. 
The legislation the governor proposed on Thursday would cost $179.1 million. 
As of Thursday, the draft budget bills adopted by the Legislature this year contain about $6.6 billion in spending. The Alaska Department of Revenue is expecting $6.1 billion in state revenue over the next year, resulting in a projected deficit of almost $500 million.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Dunleavy said that if the Legislature is able to balance the budget while still approving a one-time $1,000 BSA boost, he’d consider it.
“I would have a discussion with finance leaders to take a look at that, see where we would draw that money from to make that happen. But I’d be willing to have that discussion,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-18 02:58:39+00:00,CT Mirror,Rep. Jim Himes warns of Trump’s ‘creeping authoritarianism’,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/17/ct-rep-jim-himes-criticizes-trump/,U.S. Rep. Jim Himes unleashed a barrage of criticisms at the Trump administration and the state of the U.S. Congress on Thursday night.,"Warning of “creeping authoritarianism,” “testosterone-addled craziness” and the celebration of “abject cruelty,” U.S. Rep. Jim Himes unleashed a barrage of criticisms at the Trump administration and the state of the U.S. Congress on Thursday night.
Speaking at The Connecticut Mirror’s “In the Room” series hosted by John Dankosky at the Ferguson Library in Stamford, Himes said the Congress he serves in now — “a wholly owned subsidiary of Trump Inc.” — is almost unrecognizable from the one he first joined nearly two decades ago 
That evolution has brought a lot of frustration for him, and more rarely some glimpses of hope, during the dramatic overhaul of government under the Trump administration.
Himes had no shortage of fiery rhetoric Thursday night about the funding cuts and other moves by President Donald J. Trump, who he said is “a bully, and like all bullies, he’s a coward.” 
Himes talked in eyebrow-raising hypotheticals about the prospect of whether he would break the law by speaking publicly about classified information, if it meant holding the administration accountable, in rare circumstances.
Himes plays a key role in overseeing the intelligence community and threats to the U.S. as the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee. But much of that, he noted, happens behind closed doors because of the sensitive nature of the work.
In one possible scenario, Himes said, if Trump mobilized the CIA to go after an American in the United States, he would feel the need to defy the norms of his committee and provide the needed oversight.
“I’d have to go in front of a camera and commit a felony, which is to say, disclose classified information,” Himes said.

He does not anticipate that happening, but said it is not “crazy farfetched,” since the formation of his committee came in the wake of the Nixon administration doing something similar.
He mused about that again later in the evening when talking about law firms and other institutions being frightened to take a stand against the White House.
“I know it’s scary. Again, I’m sort of thinking about, you know, my upcoming stint in a jail somewhere,” Himes said, somewhat jokingly.
Connecticut’s congressional delegation has taken a more front-and-center role in defying the White House in recent weeks.
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy has emerged as a leading national voice of the opposition and has been outspoken that the Democratic Party did not do enough to address constituents’ anxiety, especially around cost of living.
Other Connecticut members have had some breakout moments as well. U.S. Rep. John Larson had a semi-viral moment when he railed against Republicans over Social Security. And last week, U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes joined a few other members from both parties at a televised CNN town hall, where she spoke of the “chainsaw approach.”
Himes has similar concerns as Murphy. On Thursday, Himes said the party still needs to reckon with its losses in the last election and respect the outcome of Republican-led majorities and the White House. Himes said he is “trying to be both reassuring and motivating” for constituents but did not shy away from the realities of what it means for Democrats to be in the minority party.
He acknowledged the calls from the base of the party who want lawmakers to do more and fight back with the realities of their limited powers. Ultimately, Himes said, Democrats will need to win back the U.S. House next year and overcome the GOP’s narrow majority.
“Keep the activist base happy. … The other thing we need to do, we damn well better take back the House of Representatives,” Himes said.
But when asked about the lack of norms and decorum in the current political climate and whether Democrats need to play on the same level, Himes was defiant.
“If this country has become so indecent and so appalling that we celebrate the least common denominator, I don’t want to be part of it,” Himes said.
Because of his role on the Intelligence Committee, Himes was best-positioned to ask why national security officials were using the encrypted app Signal to discuss an imminent attack on Houthi targets in Yemen, how a journalist ended up in the chat and whether classified information was shared.
When asked if there are people in the intelligence community who know what they’re doing, Himes named National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who used to serve with Himes in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Waltz was involved in the Signal chat.
Like other officials, Himes said, Waltz is under pressure to comply with the White House.
“Humans are humans. You put them into a context where the rules don’t matter, where competence doesn’t matter, where there is no accountability. Good people do dumb things,” Himes said. “It doesn’t matter whether these people are competent or not because they’re just in a circus.”
The congressman was also pressed about his vote to censure U.S. Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas, who shouted down Trump during his joint address to Congress last month. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., ordered him to be ejected from the chamber. 
Republicans moved to censure Green, a resolution that garnered support from just 10 Democrats, including Himes. He again defended his vote, saying it was consistent with his vote to reprimand GOP Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina who interrupted former President Barack Obama’s 2009 address to Congress by shouting “You lie!”
But he noted he had a tough two-hour conversation with the Connecticut NAACP about his vote to punish a Black congressman who has been one of the most vocal opponents of Trump and pushed for his impeachment in his last term.
“I was caught off guard … by the pain it caused for my African American constituents, I apologized to the NAACP for missing that,” Himes said. “You can tell I have a very serious concern for leaders who are inconsistent about the rules.”
Himes argued that the tide may start to shift as Republicans become more openly critical of Trump’s tariff strategy and as some vulnerable GOP members raise concerns about the possibility of Medicaid cuts to offset the party’s major tax package.
His frustration and concern was evident throughout most of the hour-long conversation. He said he is starting not to see Congress as a co-equal branch of government. And he said politics has turned even uglier than when he first came to Congress in 2009. 
But he ended on a hint of optimism about the role he and others hope to play.
“At what point did this country decide it was going to celebrate abject cruelty against the most vulnerable people on the planet? Himes said. “I feel energized in saying we’re going to change that.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_6890-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 23:03:16.803795

Jackie Llanos/Florida PhoenixJuan Carlos Lopez-Gomez held his mother in a tight embrace and wept following his release from the Leon County Jail Thursday evening, where the U.S. citizen was held after his arrest for illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien.”
An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.
The pair didn’t reunite until the evening, after Lopez-Gomez’s first court appearance earlier in the day. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans ruled Thursday morning that she lacked jurisdiction to release him because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him for 48 hours.
After Riggans’ inspection of his Social Security card and birth certificate, which an advocate waved in the courtroom, the judge said she found no probable cause for the charge.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
The arrest record the trooper filed states that Lopez-Gomez had said he was in the country illegally but that he had handed over his ID. There was no mention of the Social Security card on the arrest report. However, Lopez-Gomez told the Phoenix he had shown the trooper a copy of his Social Security card and Georgia state ID.
The HSI agent who took Lopez-Gomez to Wendy’s directed questions to a spokesperson, who didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment or questions as of this publication.
After the reunion with his mom, Lopez-Gomez returned to the parking lot of the jail, where 30 protesters had been demanding his release. They met him with cheers and hugs.
Lopez-Gomez will have to return to the Leon County Courthouse on May 6. He was charged under a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention.
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also made their first appearances on the same charge on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

Bob Ferguson is seen during a media availability on Tuesday, April 1, 2025. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson balked at Democratic lawmakers’ latest tax package on Thursday, calling it “too risky” given the budget tumult that actions by the federal government could trigger.
“At a time of great economic uncertainty and assaults by the Trump Administration on core state services for working families, raising $12 billion in taxes is unsustainable, too risky and fails to adequately prepare Washington state for the crisis that looms ahead,” Ferguson said in a statement.
“We must ensure Washington is in the best possible financial position to weather more cuts and damaging economic policies from a Trump Administration that weaponizes funding to punish those it disagrees with and forces them into compromising their values,” he said. 
Ferguson did not cite any specific taxes he dislikes in the proposals that House and Senate Democrats viewed as the linchpin for completing their negotiations on an operating budget that overcomes a projected $16 billion shortfall over the next four years. 
Democrats have already slimmed their tax ambitions, discarding a set of hikes Ferguson previously came out against that could have raised as much as $21 billion over four years.
Absence of further guidance from the governor on what he’d like to see threatens to slow, even derail, their progress and could drive the Legislature into overtime when the regular session ends April 27.
Special session “is certainly not our Plan A for us,” House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Seattle, said. 
Ferguson, who was in Seattle on Thursday, released the statement 20 minutes before he met virtually with Democratic leaders of both chambers. 
That conversation touched broadly on spending reductions and revenue raising. The governor did not spell out his preferences on taxes or how large a tax package is acceptable in the meeting.
“I think there are some proposals he is warmer to and some proposals he is cooler to,” Fitzgibbon said. “We have a lot to talk about in terms of options for paths forward.”
Ferguson has said repeatedly he wants to see a balance of progressive revenue and spending reductions. His staff provided options to some members this week.
“We have said that if the revenue number is too high, as he said in his statement, that we need more suggestions than they have provided so far,” Fitzgibbon said.
House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, said in a statement, that House Democrats share Ferguson’s “belief that a balanced approach combining progressive revenue and spending reductions is the right way to meet the needs of our state.”
She said her caucus appreciates all viewpoints and the governor’s preferences are taken into account as they look to ensure residents have shelter, food, access to health care, and strong public schools.
Two Republican senators applauded Ferguson’s critique of the Democrats’ latest tax plan.
“If we truly want our state to be ready for any sort of fiscal turbulence, let’s have a new budget that avoids tax increases completely — whether they’re ‘progressive’ or not,” Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, the Republican lead on the Senate budget committee, said in a statement.
Sen. Nikki Torres, R-Pasco, assistant budget leader, said “To us, any new taxes would be risky. The question now is whether the Democrat legislators will heed the governor’s words or continue going back and forth with him.”
Democrats in the House and Senate jointly released a smorgasbord of tax proposals on Tuesday, including higher taxes on big businesses, hiking the rate on capital gains above $1 million and allowing a 1% annual limit on property tax growth to rise up to 3%.
They’ve pitched other hikes as well, such as an expanded tax on nicotine products like Zyn and a new sales tax on rented self-storage units. 
And they’re seeking to have some large businesses make a one-time pre-payment of sales tax owed to the state, a maneuver that would suck more tax revenue into the 2025-27 budget that otherwise would have been due the month after it ends.
Thursday’s conversation isn’t deterring Democrats from pursuing the new tax bills, yet. 
“At the moment, I think we need to keep our options open and keep our bills moving,” Fitzgibbon said. 
Earlier this month, Ferguson rejected tax plans from the House and Senate that leaned heavily on a tax that would’ve applied to residents with certain assets worth more than $50 million. The governor and others are not confident that tax would survive an expected court challenge.
Ferguson lauded the Legislature in his statement Thursday for moving on from the so-called wealth tax. 
A couple hours before lawmakers met with the governor, Jinkins told reporters she hoped to hear “things that he likes and things that he doesn’t like.”
“I’ve been waiting to hear some things that he likes,” she said. Asked if she had heard him cite anything that he likes in any proposal, she joked in response, “Have you?”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0811-scaled-e1744939528175-1024x647.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 22:00:06.857721

After the reunion with his mom, Lopez-Gomez returned to the parking lot of the jail, where 30 protesters had been demanding his release. They met him with cheers and hugs.
Lopez-Gomez will have to return to the Leon County Courthouse on May 6. He was charged under a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention.
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also made their first appearances on the same charge on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s mental health department faces a $43 million deficit, and letters canceling some provider contracts were sent without the agency head’s knowledge, the agency’s commissioner said during a special legislative hearing Thursday. 
Oklahoma lawmakers questioned Commissioner Allie Friesen for hours amid reports of financial disarray at the Oklahoma State Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and outrage over provider contracts being “cut” or “canceled.” She was one of 11 witnesses called by the committee to testify under oath. 
Friesen, who was appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt in January 2024, said her administration inherited a “chaotic” situation and former agency leaders failed to make proper budget requests of the Legislature, leading to financial shortfalls. 
“What this administration will not tolerate is, ‘Make it look good and don’t show anybody the bad,’” she said. 
The extent of the shortfall has been under question, as officials originally believed it was $63 million. Friesen said further investigation after the deficiency was initially brought to her attention found it was $43 million. 
Some providers who have contracts with the agency have said they received notice that their contracts were altered or terminated retroactively, meaning funds for services already provided may not come. 
Letters referenced “incentive or bonus payments,” Friesen said, and some providers “independently” decided to lay off staff and close facilities.

“As soon as I realized that those are functioning not as a bonus, but rather as a core component of care, we pivoted,” Friesen said. “And we realized that we needed to quickly ask for a supplemental (appropriation), and we need to make sure that these providers have what they need.”
The agency requested a $6.2 million supplemental appropriation Monday to ensure “balanced budget and the continued delivery of essential behavioral health services” for the current fiscal year. It was unclear how the agency planned to fill the rest of the deficit.
Other letters canceled contracts for three Tulsa-area certified community behavioral health clinics in relation to a protest to a request for proposal, or RFP. 
Friesen said these letters were sent by the Office of Management and Enterprise Services without her or her general counsel’s knowledge. 
Christa Helfrey, a spokesperson for OMES, said in a statement after the hearing that the process has been reviewed to ensure there is “no potential lapse in communication or services for Oklahomans” and the agency is “committed to assisting all agencies with the procurement process.” 
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, who chaired the special committee said there is “an ongoing dispute” over the process for soliciting bids for services in the Tulsa area that some claim was unfair. He said notices of cancellation, effective May 10, from OMES were sent to Family and Children’s Services, CREOKS Health Services, and Grand Mental Health, all of which are involved in the dispute. 
Tulsa District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler, who testified Thursday, questioned why all three cancellations were for providers in the Tulsa area and whether they were retaliatory against contractors who “challenged” the agency’s RFP. 
In its budget proposal this year, the Mental Health Department requested $569 million from the state Legislature for the 2026 fiscal year, a 48% increase from last year’s appropriation. Friesen said the agency is working on an amended budget request to present to the Legislature.

The Legislature must approve a state budget by the end of session in May. 
House budget chair Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, previously told Oklahoma Voice the agency’s past administration had been paying prior year bills with new money, and it caught up with them.
The agency has several ongoing financial strains, including a recently approved consent decree expected to cost between $26 million and $45 million over three to five years, and the construction of a new inpatient behavioral health hospital that’s $124 million over budget. 
Friesen reported Thursday that the agency has reduced the competency restoration waitlist to 154 individuals, which is a 33% reduction from the time the lawsuit that led to the settlement was filed. 
A total of four staff members left the agency in December and were asked, but “not required,” to sign what Friesen referred to as both “nondisclosure agreements” and “settlements” during her testimony. 
The agency’s former chief financial officer, Richard Edwards, previously told Oklahoma Voice he resigned under threat of termination and was being used as a scapegoat for the financial issues.
The agreements did not resolve legal issues or complaints, Friesen said. Lawmakers requested to see the agreements, which Friesen said she will provide within the week, pending a review of their confidentiality. 
A handful of investigations into the agency have been requested, including to the state auditor, the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency, a “special investigator,” and Thursday’s special House committee. 
Ahead of Thursday’s hearing, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said lawmakers weren’t sure how it was going to end and just wanted to “dig in” to find out “what in the world is going on.”
“Let’s get some answers,” Hilbert said. “And obviously there’s a lot of talk about the numbers, and that certainly matters, the budget matters. But we also have to talk about the people at the end of those numbers that are impacted by the decisions that have been going on.”
Investigations from the state auditor, the House, and LOFT are all in communication and collaborative efforts, he said. He was unsure what the plans of the special investigator were. 
Commissioner Friesen on Thursday also briefly referenced an investigation from the Office of the Inspector General, a federal agency that’s tasked with rooting out fraud, waste and other abuses and to improve Medicaid and Medicare efficiency. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Stitt said Wednesday that if the committee finds something that needs to be “fixed,” he’ll be the first to take action. He reiterated his stance that funding for the agency is not being cut and said some contracts were under review where the request for proposal process “wasn’t done accurately.” 
“What you’re seeing now is because (Allie) got rid of her CFO, and she got rid of, like, four or five of her lieutenants, and then everything started coming up,” he said. “So sometimes, when you have people with agencies that have been there for 30, 40 years, they’re moving the ball pretty good. They understand how this, how this building works, and they’re paying every invoice so nobody squawks.”
After meeting for over three hours, House lawmakers said they planned to continue the hearing next week.
The Mental Health Department’s interim chief financial officer, a former chief of staff, the director of the Legislature’s fiscal oversight body, a few providers, and the purchasing director for the state will return next week to testify.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The scene outside Thursday’s Watertown Rotary luncheon turned raucous in the presence of South Dakota’s senior U.S. senator.
Not long after the event, staffers urged Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune into a black sedan as protesters outside Watertown’s Elks Lodge yelled “do your job.” 
Before he left, though, Thune said he didn’t take issue with the people doing the yelling.
“We hear in our office on a fairly regular basis from people across the state on sort of all sides of the issues. Clearly these protesters are very anti-Trump policy, and so they have every right to make their voices heard,” Thune said. “We welcome that.”
The protesters want Thune to oppose several of the president’s efforts, and for him to hold public town halls.

The noon event where Thune took questions was open to Rotary Club members and media, not the general public. Several protesters said they’d reached out to Thune’s office through phone or email in recent months without a response.
“Our senator doesn’t have the guts to stand up to what Trump is doing,” said Kay Solberg, an organizer who said she plans to hold another protest in Watertown this weekend.
It was the second gathering of displeased citizens to greet Thune in as many days. More than 100 people protested outside a Thune event in Rapid City Wednesday.
Thune said he doesn’t see how a public town hall “accomplishes anything that we don’t accomplish on a daily basis.” He maintains that he’s “probably one of the most accessible politicians in South Dakota.” 
 
That’s why Thune was behind schedule on Thursday, his staff said. He’d taken two too many questions from Watertown Rotarians, held a second press conference that wasn’t scheduled, and stopped to shake hands again and again with Watertown residents who had lingering questions and concerns.
Wednesday marked Thune’s third event in the state this week during Congress’ April recess, following the Pennington County Republican Women’s meeting in Rapid City and an appearance at Northern State University in Aberdeen on Tuesday. He’s also spent hours visiting with the public at the state basketball tournament in Aberdeen in March, he said.

“If people have questions, we’re available on a regular basis,” Thune said.
Thune answered several questions during the Rotary meeting, addressing the uncertainty regarding foreign trade, immigration and cuts to entitlement programs. 
Thune encourages patience on tariffs
Thune has long been a critic of tariffs and supportive of free trade deals, but said South Dakotans should offer grace to Trump and his shifting tariff policy “to see what kind of deals he can strike.” 
At a town hall earlier this week, Augustana Economics Professor Reynold Nesiba said tariffs risk relationships with other countries. U.S. beef exports to China were halted, the former Democratic state lawmaker said, allowing Australia to fill the gap. The same can happen with China’s soybean imports, Nesiba said, shifting from the United States to Brazil.
Trump’s intention, Thune said Wednesday, is to negotiate better trade deals and create a “more level playing field,” especially regarding China’s trade practices. He said he’s heard support from agricultural producers in the state on the plan.
America should explore partnerships with other countries in the meantime, Thune said. He supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership during the Obama administration, which would have opened up markets in countries like Japan and South Korea.
“We have a lot of national security interests in the region, and they’re allies of ours and we can use that to isolate China,” Thune said. “What you don’t want is these countries running into China’s orbit.”
If Trump’s trade policies are “used in a way that gets a trilateral deal in place, for example with Japan and South Korea, that would be a win.”
Medicaid’s role in budget reconciliation
Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s plan to pass a budget reconciliation bill by Memorial Day is “certainly aspirational,” Thune said.

Since Republicans control the House and Senate, they can unlock the reconciliation process to fast-track major spending legislation and bypass the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster role with a simple majority.
Thune expects to iron out differences between budget resolutions from the House and Senate and send the finished product to Trump’s desk “hopefully by the middle of summer to create some economic certainty.”
Congress needs to “get it done right,” Thune said. 
“Whatever amount of time that takes, we’re going to do the right thing,” he said.
Republicans hope to leverage the process to extend and expand expiring tax cuts, increase border security and defense spending and cut federal spending throughout the budget. 
Medicaid is on the chopping block, Thune said. The House budget envisions a Medicaid cut of $880 million over a 10 year period, although the House Energy and Commerce Committee would have to hammer out how to save the money.
Medicaid cuts rippling through rural America could bring hospital closures, job losses

Medicaid is a federal-state health insurance program for people with low income. Medicaid spending is projected to cost $7.4 trillion over the next decade.
Thune proposed Medicaid work requirements rather than cutting the program as a way to “achieve a significant level of savings that would strengthen the program and not harm people who are beneficiaries.”
The change would generate more than $100 billion in savings over a decade, he said. 
South Dakota voters approved a constitutional amendment during the 2024 general election to allow the state to implement Medicaid work requirements if the federal government allows them. 
Thune says he’s ‘not worried’ about legal status of immigrants
Rotarian Don Goldhorn said he appreciated Thune’s appearance, but said some responses left him disgruntled.
Goldhorn and his wife sponsored a work visa for a Ukrainian family, he said, helping them adjust to life in the United States during Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine. The two-year work visa will end in September, and Goldman is concerned the family won’t receive an extension and be forced to return to their besieged home country. 
“If they came here legally into this country,” Thune said, “and they’re law-abiding citizens here, I’m not worried.”
Other Rotarians received similar responses from Thune about the detention of Pro-Palestine protesters because of allegedly antisemitic behavior.
“I’m not satisfied,” Goldhorn told South Dakota Searchlight, “and it’s nothing personal against Sen. Thune. I went to get some specific answers, and I didn’t feel like there were specific answers.”
Driving past protesters to enter the building before the luncheon began, though, Goldhorn wondered if a town hall would accomplish what the protesters might hope it would. 
Thune could speak directly to all constituents, he said, and they could raise their concerns or dissatisfaction to him. But the Rotarian worries that larger, more public town halls could turn from peaceful to confrontational.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderOver 100 international college students and recent graduates who say their immigration records have been abruptly revoked may soon have some temporary relief.
In an Atlanta courtroom Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Calvert said she is inclined to grant that relief.
“I just need to figure out the contours,” she said.
In the suit before Calvert, 133 students from universities around the country – including 26 from Georgia – said the administration of President Donald Trump and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement improperly cut off their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System records, or SEVIS.
When it was originally filed last week, the case included 17 students and recent graduates, seven from Georgia. They attend schools including the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Emory University and Kennesaw State University.
Attorney Charles Kuck, who represented the students, said SEVIS was created after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to track international students. Losing SEVIS status would effectively end an international student’s ability to keep studying in the U.S.
“SEVIS is kind of like the Big Brother for foreign students, and if you violate any term in that, you get terminated,” he said. “But also, apparently, you get terminated when you don’t violate any terms in it, according to the new theory of ICE.”
Kuck said the students weren’t told the specific reasons for their terminations. Many of his clients have had minor run-ins with the law, including traffic offenses like speeding or driving with an expired license, a DUI charge that was reduced to reckless driving or in one case, a domestic violence charge that was later dropped for lack of evidence. Some said they have no criminal or traffic history.
Kuck said none of his clients have been accused of any infraction that would result in loss of SEVIS under federal rules, and he believes the government flagged his clients and others en masse using AI without any judicial review.
An Inside Higher Ed analysis found that as of Thursday, over 240 colleges around the country have reported 1,480 international students and recent graduates who have had their legal status changed by the State Department. Federal judges in other states have already issued orders to temporarily reinstate students.
International students make up about 8% of the nearly 346,000 students enrolled in Georgia’s public colleges and universities.
The revocations have sparked protests, including at Georgia campuses.
Kuck said many of the students are close to graduation, and some have job offers they stand to lose out on, including one as a Georgia Tech professor.
He said one of the plaintiffs has attempted suicide and many of the others are terrified.
“A lot of our clients are so fragile mentally, emotionally, they don’t know what to do, they’re very concerned about if ICE is going to knock on their door, I mean, they’re panicked. And so we’ve spent a lot of time, unfortunately, calming them down, saying relax, it’s going to be okay, we’ve got your back, you’re not going to get picked up, and this is all going to work out.”
Attorney David Powell with the U.S. Attorney’s Office argued that the students had not shown any evidence that they have suffered permanent harm. He said students should reapply for their SEVIS status and suggested that they could transfer credits and complete their studies in their home countries or in Canada.
He requested that any relief be narrowly tailored to allow students to finish semesters they had already paid for but not to include recent graduates who are in the country performing optional practical training, a program which allows them to work in the country while waiting in the lottery for an H-1B visa – a foreign worker visa that allows foreign citizens with specialized skills to work in the U.S. – or make other plans for the future.
The government has until midnight Friday to file a motion in the case, and Calvert could issue temporary relief shortly afterwards.
Calvert, who was appointed to the bench in 2022 by former President Joe Biden, scheduled a follow-up hearing April 24 to consider more permanent relief.

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Democrats in the West Virginia Senate are urging Gov. Patrick Morrisey not to sign a bill they say was not legally passed because of a “series of procedural irregularities.”
The letter concerns the Senate’s passage of Senate Bill 474, a governor-requested bill that would end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state. 
The House of Delegates passed the bill late on Saturday, the last day of the 60-day legislative session. The Democrats say the Senate erred in the procedures it took late Saturday night as it approved the House’s amended version of the bill. 
In a letter to the governor, Senate President Randy Smith and Senate Clerk Lee Cassis Thursday, Sens. Mike Woefel, D-Cabell, and Joey Garcia, D-Marion, the only two senators from the minority party, say that Senate Republicans improperly suspended a rule they apparently used to bypass considering several pending amendments from Garcia and pass the bill in the final minutes of session. They also argue the Republicans made two other procedural errors. 
“Due to the Senate’s patent disregard of established legislative procedure, the bill did not properly complete legislative action, and it should not be enrolled, authenticated, or presented to the Governor for approval,” the letter says. “If the bill is sent to the Governor, it must be vetoed on technical grounds due to the Senate’s failure to adhere to its own binding rules of  procedure.”
The Senate originally passed the bill March 26. The House passed the bill at 10:41 p.m. Saturday after nearly three hours of debate. When the bill went back to the Senate to approve the House’s changes, more than a dozen amendments from Garcia appeared to be pending on the legislation. 
Sen. Amy Grady, R-Mason, at first made a motion to concur with the House’s changes to the bill and pass it. The senate stood at ease for a few minutes before Grady withdrew the motion. 


 
A few minutes later, Sen. Eric Tar, R-Putnam, moved to suspend Joint Rule 3, which governs how amendments to amendments and disagreements are handled between the two legislative chambers, and concur and pass Senate Bill 474. The rule suspension required a two-thirds roll call vote by both chambers, but the approval was made by a voice vote and with objections heard. The Senate then passed the bill with a 31-2 vote.
A short time later, Tarr moved to reconsider the vote by which they concurred and passed the bill. The Democrats argue that the Senate failed to properly reconsider the motion. Tarr instead moved to withdraw his motion and then moved to concur with the House’s version of the bill. 
Next, Senate Majority Leader Patrick Martin, R-Lewis, moved the previous question. Smith turned down Garcia’s request that pending amendments be considered, saying that another motion had been called. 
The Senate then voted again to concur with the House’s version of the bill and then passed the bill. 
Even if the Senate’s first passage of the bill was done properly, the Democrats argue, the Senate was required to consider the pending amendments before it could concur in the House’s changes to the bill, and they failed to do so.
“If the senator and the governor don’t do the right thing, I think this will be litigated and the bill will go down in flames,” Garcia said in an interview with West Virginia MetroNews Thursday.
The West Virginia Democratic Party and the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia have also condemned the way the bill was passed. The ACLU-WV wrote in a blog post Monday that the Senate likely broke its own rules in rushing the bill through at the last minute. 
“If Gov. Morrisey signs the bill (which we fully expect he will) then we will see the state in court,” the organization wrote.
Representatives for Morrisey and Smith did not comment Thursday.

(Photo: Angela Dennis)Civil rights attorney Ben Crump visited Knoxville on Wednesday to discuss lawsuits against Knox County and the University of Tennessee Medical Center over the deaths of two Black men following encounters with county law enforcement officers.
Crump, who is representing the families of Daevon Saint-Germain and David Batts, compared the death of Saint-Germain to that of Breonna Taylor, who was killed during a police raid in Louisville, Ky, in March 2020.
“This is Knoxville’s Breonna Taylor,” Crump said. “The killing of an 18-year-old high school senior. There are so many unanswered questions as to why he was shot nine times, and no video footage exists to explain why this young man was killed that morning.”
Saint-Germain was shot and killed on Jan. 3 by Knox County Sheriff SWAT deputies during an early morning raid at his family’s south Knoxville home.
The Knox County Sheriff’s Office (KCSO) says deputies were carrying out a search warrant when Saint-Germain allegedly showed a firearm, prompting officers to open fire. The warrant was reportedly issued based on social media activity that investigators claimed linked Saint-Germain to drug sales, including marijuana and THC products.
But the details of what happened during the raid remain murky. SWAT officers involved were not wearing body cameras, a fact that has fueled growing concerns over transparency and accountability of the KCSO. Saint-Germain’s family, who were inside the home at the time, deny the allegations about him.

Despite the absence of body camera footage, Crump expressed confidence in his legal team’s path forward.
“With eyewitness accounts, physical evidence, and strong expert testimony, we believe we can bring a successful 1983 civil rights wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of Daevon’s family,” he said.
In March after a petition circulated calling for answers and police reform, Sheriff Tom Spangler expressed regret at the lack of body cameras but defended the actions of deputies.
Spangler announced at a community meeting that he directed his SWAT team members to begin using body cameras after discovering they were not equipped with them during the raid.
“They did not have cameras. I wish they had, but they didn’t and that’s it. But, with that said, they are already in place now,” he  said.
Crump also attributed the circumstances surrounding delivery of the warrant to racial bias.
“This was a kid with no criminal history,” said Crump. “And we are talking about an alleged social media post about marijuana. Can you imagine if they started kicking in everyone’s door in violation of the fourth amendment because of marijuana?
“Sadly this only seems to happen to Black people in this country,” he said.










David Batts needed help. It’s troubling so many times when a Black person in America is having a medical crisis or mental health crisis, it is not treated as a medical issue. 


– Ben Crump


Five days after Saint-Germain’s death, 46-year-old David Batts died on Jan. 8 following a violent encounter with law enforcement at the Roger D. Wilson Detention Facility. Batts was arrested the day before after causing an alleged disturbance at the Knoxville Area Transit center and was initially taken to the University of Tennessee Medical Center. There, he was accused of assaulting two nurses, which led to his transfer to the county jail.
Within minutes of his arrival at the facility, deputies attempted to force Batts to change into a jail uniform. When he did not comply, officers pepper-sprayed him, used a Taser on him four times, and struck him repeatedly. The blows to his face were so severe that family members later said he was nearly unrecognizable. Batts was found unresponsive the next day and later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Crump said that Batts was in need of care, not violence.
”David Batts needed help. It’s troubling so many times when a Black person in America is having a medical crisis or mental health crisis, it is not treated as a medical issue,” he said. “It is treated as a criminal issue, and it is met with excessive force and brutality.”
According to the KCSO, Batts was non compliant, which prompted officers to use force. Body camera footage released by the sheriff’s office shows Batts struggling to follow commands during attempts to check his vital signs. Batts was taken back to UTMC where he died in the hospital.
The Knox County District Attorney’s Office reviewed the incident and concluded that Batts’ death was caused by meningitis, not by the actions of law enforcement officers. 
“Based on my review of the body camera footage and the Medical Examiner’s preliminary findings, I have concluded that the officers involved responded to Mr. Batts’ assaultive and resistive behavior with appropriate force under the circumstances,” District Attorney Charme Allen wrote in a statement.
Crump, along with co-counsel Troy Jones, a Knoxville lawyer, said the legal team will file dual suits — one for medical malpractice against the University of Tennessee Medical Center and a federal civil rights wrongful death suit against the Knox County Sheriff’s Department.
Crump also urged Knoxville community members to stay vigilant and continue raising awareness about the deaths of Batts and Saint-Germain. He acknowledged the challenge of mobilizing in a city where only 17 percent of the population is African American, but emphasized that justice requires persistence even without overwhelming numbers. 
“I believe when you have truth on your side, you have a moral majority,” he said. “And so I want the community to remain engaged and have the same convictions they have with all these other cases across the country.”

(Courtesy of Big Sioux River Project)SIOUX FALLS – Keeping cattle waste out of the river that runs through the state’s largest city will cost about $11 million over the next five years, and the city will pay more than half the price.
One of the designers of the water quality program that money pays for, however, told an audience in Sioux Falls that past investments have paid off.
The Big Sioux River is polluted with dissolved soils, agricultural chemicals and livestock waste beyond levels safe for uses like fishing and swimming. City, federal and state money has been used for a little over a decade to pay landowners to leave strips of tallgrass or other vegetation in the land along the banks of a river or a tributary. The root systems in those buffer strips catch and filter out pollutants before they enter the water, and also prevent erosion.

During Thursday’s Big Sioux Stewardship Summit, program developer Barry Berg,  said his team and partners have enrolled over 100 stream miles into their buffer strip program since its inception.
“We finally reached the century mark with the program,” he said during a morning presentation.
The enrolled areas now total more than 4,000 acres, with an additional 250 to 300 slated for enrollment this spring, Berg said.
Under the primary model of the program, livestock are blocked from bank access from April through September. Farmers are allowed to cut the grass for hay after June 15. The idea is to keep cattle out of streams during hot summer months when they’re most likely to wade in and defecate, spiking E. coli levels.
Berg said advancing the program is an arduous process that involves enrolling landowners in conservation agreements, coordinating federal and state funding streams, and adapting grazing and haying practices to better protect streambanks and riparian vegetation.
A focal point of the effort is Skunk Creek, which flows about 70 miles from Brant Lake into the Big Sioux River near Sioux Falls. Skunk Creek now contributes over half of the water that flows over the falls at Falls Park and through the city, due to a diversion upstream on the Big Sioux near the airport.
Skunk Creek historically carries a lot of E. coli into the river. But today, he said 44% of its banks in the program’s footprint and 48% of adjacent pastureland acres have been enrolled. And that’s making a big difference, he said. It’s possible, he said, for the state’s integrated water quality report to take Skunk Creek off its list of impaired water bodies if the program keeps its momentum.
“Back in 2013 and 2014, we had samples on Skunk Creek with 50 to 70% exceeding standards,” for permissible E. coli and suspended solids, he said. “Now we’re down around 10 to 11% exceeding. If we get down below 10 and hold that for two years in the integrated report, they’re gonna say, ‘Hey, we’re passing. Skunk Creek is no longer impaired.’”

For Skunk Creek, “no longer impaired” would mean its waters would be safe for non-immersion recreational activities like kayaking or canoeing. Because it feeds the Big Sioux, that would move the river’s water quality within city limits closer to what advocates want: a swimmable river.

Participating farmers see financial benefits, Berg added. He described working with one landowner to calculate returns on haying the buffer land. The landowner made more through incentive payments and hay than he would have by planting corn or soybeans.
When the last five-year phase of the project wraps up this summer, the water quality investments will have supported 16 watering stations, over 4,000 feet of fencing, 12,000 feet of pipe, and four barns, built with manure-trapping pits beneath them. Additionally, the final phase also saw over 1,000 acres of cover crop planted and 900 more acres enrolled in the buffer program. 
The next five years will continue that work, with $11 million already earmarked. That includes about $5.8 million from Sioux Falls, $3.2 million in federal grants and funding, $1.4 million in local cash and donations, $465,000 from Dell Rapids, and $263,000 from the East Dakota Water Development District. 
Berg said his long-term goal is to enroll 75% of Skunk Creek’s streambanks.
“If we can get there, I believe we’ll see it delisted for E. coli,” he said. “We’re already close.”
Travis Entenmann, director of Friends of the Big Sioux River, said the effort is not only about compliance and conservation, but the city’s future. A clean river, he said, is one that people can use.
“It’s a huge opportunity for us for tourism,” he said. “The idea that it could be 90 degrees outside and there’s not families recreating in the river; it is kind of sad. And we should want better.”
A voluntary, incentive-based approach is how the state primarily tries to tackle the issue of E. Coli contamination in its waters, but he said more could be done. 
“The three things that I believe will clean our river are regulation, enforcement of regulation, and land use change,” he later said.

Gret Hertz, R-Polson, wears a money jacket on the Senate floor  during the debate on House Bill 2 ""because we're giving away money.""Taking barely three hours on the Senate floor, the framework to appropriate more than $16.6 billion for Montanan’s biennial budget received a stamp of approval from legislators in the upper chamber on Thursday. 
That isn’t to say House Bill 2 passed smoothly. 
Democrats, and a coalition of nine moderate Republicans — who have worked to carry many of Gov. Greg Gianforte’s proposals through the legislature, to the consternation of their GOP peers — held together on almost every vote taken to amend the budget, including passing the final package 27-23. 
But more conservative members of the Republican caucus, which on paper is the majority party in the Senate, decried the budget as bloated and accused lawmakers of prioritizing politics over good policy. 
“We have a general fund budget that has grown by 17%. I feel sorry for those of you who will be coming back in future years,” said Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, wearing a jacket and tie emblazoned with hundred dollar bills. “There are now 27 of you who have decided to push this budget through, and it’s a big number. So now you’re going to have to make some tough choices on the floor.”
Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, chairman of the Senate Finance and Claims Committee, called the budget the “biggest one we’ve seen in recent memory,” excluding the last two biennia that were bolstered by federal COVID funding. 
The total appropriation in House Bill 2, which includes operations for the state government but excludes statutory appropriations, like hunting license fees going to game programs, is $16.6 billion for the next two years. The budget bill also excludes individual appropriation bills. 
Of that, Health and Human Services comprises 44% — or $7.3 billion — for the 2026 and 2027 fiscal years. Education accounts for $3.5 billion; transportation and natural resources makes up $2.9 billion; general government expenditures $1.6 billion and the judicial branch, law enforcement and justice accounts for $1.2 billion. 
“In the end it’s not perfect. It’s not exactly what we would probably draw up,” Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, told the Daily Montanan after the vote. “But as I said on the floor, we felt like it was a good compromise. We didn’t get everything we wanted, but we got some important things that we think will allow us to provide what we think are the services that Montanans want.”
While the budget took the House an entire day to go through each section, debating amendments to add or subtract funds from various departments and programs, the Senate kept discussion to less than three hours.

Twenty-two amendments were proposed, a majority by the chamber’s most fiscally conservative members, but only four passed — three brought by Democrats and one by Fort Benton Republican Sen. Josh Kassmier, who has emerged as a leader among the moderate Republicans. 
One amendment that passed, brought by Sen. Ellie Boldman, cut $35 million of spending authority from the state hospital to contract with traveling nurses. 
The Department of Public Health and Human Services spent $71 million for traveling healthcare staff at the state hospital during the current biennium, according to Boldman, a Missoula Democrat. However, the department has recently begun hiring state employees — a nurse a week — according to Boldman, saving a large portion of their budget. 
“This amendment reduces contract labor, supports the state continuing to do what we asked them to do, and hire state nurses at the hospital,” Boldman said. 
But Glimm pushed back, telling his colleagues that passing the amendment would leave patients in the state hospital without nurses. 
“The reason we haven’t hired state employee nurses is because we can’t get them. That’s why we hire traveling nurses at a much higher rate,” Glimm said. “… if you guys want to have not any nurses working there, I mean, a third of the staff, and you want them all to work triple over time and be worn out and burned out, and feel underappreciated, because we can’t supplement them?”
Another amendment  by Sen. Shane Morigeau, another Missoula Democrat, added $1.7 million back into the budget for the existing pretrial diversion program through the state Supreme Court. An amendment by Sen. Janet Ellis, D-Helena, slightly reduced appropriations for community college assistance programs.  
A majority of proposed amendments that were dismissed by the body aimed to shrink the budget — making cuts to Department of Labor programs, decreasing provider rates, after-school program funding, and reducing numerous budgeted positions across various departments.
Republican Senate President Matt Regier proposed an amendment to eliminate two of seven newly budgeted game warden positions at the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. 
“As an avid hunter and outdoorsmen, I know hunters are very ethical. I’d rather have our money going into decreasing my license, my tags, not out policing more,” Regier said. 
Flowers, who worked for FWP for much of his career, said the department’s enforcement division had been flat for a long time while the state’s population had only seen growth. 
“These workers are an important piece of the department’s effort to not only enforce the rules that are out there, but also they act as a liaison with sportsmen and women every day, They act as a liaison … so trying to maintain good relationships between landowners, outfitters, sportsmen, really falls on these warden positions,” Flowers said.
Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, said he had a number of bad experiences being “harassed” by game wardens, raising his voice as he shared personal anecdotes. 
“We may need seven more game wardens, but the message from me today is don’t harass me. I’m tired of it,” McGillvray said, recommending game wardens receive more sensitivity training in the future. 
  A series of amendments, mostly aimed at reducing the state budget, failed in the Senate on April 17.
The debate over the game warden amendment failed 23-27, the same margin as roughly half the failed amendments. 
One more lopsided amendment, which failed in a 21-29 vote with just three Republicans joining Democrats, would have changed the funding authority for the current contract with CoreCivic to house 600 inmates in out-of-state facilities to be one-time-only, as opposed to ongoing funding. 
Frustrations with the way the floor debates kept going were evident throughout the morning. 
During discussion on the final funding package, Sen. John Esp, R-Big Timber, often referred to as the Dean of the Montana Senate, said the body had become more flawed over his lengthy tenure, devolving into short-term thinkers focused on sound bites for the next press conference. 
“Sadly, this is what Montana politics has morphed into. I’ve been in the majority and I’ve been in the minority, and I can tell you that most of those years, all things being equal, good policy initiatives were supported no matter who was in charge or who brought the idea forward,” Esp said. “In about three months, well, maybe even three days, nobody can remember what we talked about here on this board today, nothing.”
Glimm agreed with the sentiments, saying the bill’s outcome was predetermined by the Senate’s working majority coalition. 
“I would like nothing better than to have a good, honest debate and really dig in and see what the priorities of each step along the way were, because that’s how it’s supposed to work. But the reason it went so fast in Senate Finance and Claims and here on the floor too, is because the cake is baked,” Glimm said. “… that happened on day one.”
In the middle of the budget debate, Gov. Greg Gianforte held a press conference where he briefly spoke about the work being done in the Senate and the need to enact a balanced budget that limits spending.
“Our budget that we proposed — the path to security and prosperity — does that. It kept spending growth under the rate of inflation without growing the size of government. But as our budget has made it through the legislative process, it’s grown,” Gianforte said. “While I respect the role of the legislature, I reiterate we must pass a responsible budget in line with Montana’s priorities.”
Gianforte said that while the Constitution requires the state to have a balanced budget, he would “use the tools we have,” to ensure it doesn’t grow the government too much. 
Montana’s governor has the power to line-item veto items in an appropriations bill — he can sign the entire budget into law, but strike out specific parts he disagrees with. 
But Glimm, the Senate Finance chairman, said the budget was already too big when the governor proposed it, and the Legislature was skirting its authority by not reigning in that spending — setting up a conflict with the governor’s office. He said he’s voted for every budget bill in his six previous sessions in the Legislature, “but I can’t do it this time.”
“We’re passing everything under the sun, and I imagine that the governor is going to veto his way to a balanced budget,” Glimm said. “He’s going to veto that, and then he’s going to say, ‘Look at the crummy job that the legislature did. They passed all this stuff, and they sent it to me and I had to be the fiscally responsible one.’” 
Regier, a self-described “appropriations nerd,” told his Senate colleagues that he had grave concerns over the budget and the future of the state’s finances. The Legislative Fiscal Division initially had projected the state would have an ending fund surplus of $522 million.

“Look at where we’re out now, on the graph. Right there, the big headline, negative $500 million. We have spent it all over twice.” Regier said. “And just as it’s been said here before, we’re not done here making decisions.”
With tax policy decisions still coming up, Regier said he hoped the Senate would be able to prioritize offering relief for Montanans, rather than focusing on spending. 
Regier referenced Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who visited the state earlier in the session and said he’d directed the Florida legislature that they couldn’t spend a dollar more than the previous session. 
“That would be amazing for my constituents that are paying for all of this,” Regier said. “… In 2026, the lines cross and we go into the red. That’s not sustainable.”
“And with that, happy voting.”

March 3, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative committee failed to advance a bill Thursday meant to help implement and regulate medical cannabis in Nebraska, leaving the sponsor and advocates on the hunt for a new path forward.
The General Affairs Committee stalled, voting 5-3 against advancing Legislative Bill 677 from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. Senators tried to advance the bill as-is after none of the eight members entertained a motion on whether to amend the bill during continuing negotiations on how best to implement the overwhelming voter approval of medical cannabis in November.
Hansen, after the vote, described his legislation as “a must” for 2025 to prevent the “Wild West.” That’s because without legislative action, the regulatory commission voters created with the ballot measure has no effective power or funds to regulate medical cannabis.

There is still “some room” to come together, Hansen said, though the “clock is ticking.” 
“I don’t want to shut all the doors right now, but some doors are closing, and they’re closing fast, and so we have to act,” Hansen told reporters.
The lead spokesperson for Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana also said the fight isn’t over.
Regulatory commission
Unless the committee reconsiders, Hansen faces a tough path to getting LB 677 into law, though the legislative rules do provide a path. He can file a motion — requiring at least 25 votes — to pull the bill out of committee. That would require scheduling by Speaker John Arch of La Vista, who has opposed medical cannabis in the past.
The bill would then need to advance across three rounds of debate and pass with at least 33 senators, regardless of a filibuster, because it amends legal language voters approved.
Ballot measures are self-enacting, and Nebraskans have legally been able to acquire up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a written health care practitioner’s recommendation since mid-December, when Gov. Jim Pillen formally proclaimed the success of the measures and ushered the voter-approved language into law.

Hansen’s bill, which has the support of organizers of the 2024 medical cannabis campaign, would further expand the structure for regulating cannabis through the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission.
Without state funds, officials have said it is nearly impossible for the commission to act or craft regulations, as required, by July 1. Hansen’s bill would push back the deadline for regulations and licensing for more time to act.
The proposed committee amendment
The amendment that members of the General Affairs Committee negotiated with Hansen would additionally regulate cannabis through the state system’s prescription drug monitoring system in addition to seed-to-sale tracking systems, according to a copy obtained by the Nebraska Examiner.
Acceptable forms of cannabis would include edibles, concentrates, ointments, transdermal patches or creams, nebulizers and vaporizer cartridges or pens. However, smoking would be prohibited, and no cannabis flower or bud could be legally sold.
State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County said he completely disagreed with allowing vaping, pointing to increased youth drug use.
A qualified “health care practitioner” would include only licensed physicians, osteopathic physicians, physician assistants or nurse practitioners, and practitioners could not recommend cannabis unless they have treated the individual for at least six months or if the physician primarily practices in Nebraska.

The committee amendment also would have limited “qualifying medical conditions” to 15 ailments:

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Autism with frequent self-injurious or aggressive behavior.
Cancer.
Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.
Epilepsy or epileptic seizures.
Hepatitis C that causes moderate to severe nausea or cachexia.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Huntington’s disease.
Parkinson’s disease.
Spinal cord injury or disease with residual neurologic deficits.
Terminal illness with a probable life expectancy of under one year.
Tourette’s syndrome.
A serious medical condition or related treatment that causes severe nausea or cachexia.
Severe and persistent muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or muscular dystrophy.
Severe or chronic pain lasting longer than six months that is not adequately managed, in the opinion of a health care practitioner, despite treatment attempts using either conventional medications other than opioids or opiates or physical interventions.

The amendment also would explicitly allow the Medical Cannabis Commission and Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, which consist of the same three commissioners, to share resources in carrying out the respective laws.
The governor would be able to appoint two additional members to the Medical Cannabis Commission, one of whom would need to be a health care practitioner. The governor already appoints the three members of the Liquor Control Commission, bringing the allowable total to five commissioners.
State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney said he wanted to allow the governor to appoint up to two more outside members, such as law enforcement or supply chain representatives.
Ongoing litigation
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, committee vice chair, said he wanted to ensure the physician appointee had human medical experience and wasn’t, for example, a veterinarian. Pillen is a veterinarian, as is John Kuehn, a former state senator and one of the chief opponents to the medical cannabis laws. 
Kuehn has filed two lawsuits seeking to void the provisions, the first of which the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office joined and that the Attorney General’s Office and Kuehn lost. Kuehn is appealing to the Nebraska Supreme Court. The second is ongoing in Lancaster County District Court.

Cavanaugh said he generally is against creating an ailments list but that the identified conditions were “relatively reasonable,” though he wants post-traumatic stress disorder included.
Holdcroft said the list was created with input from the Nebraska Medical Association, including work led by former State Sen. Anna Wishart of Lincoln, who championed medical cannabis and was part of the past three ballot measures. Holdcroft said the association was strongly against allowing marijuana for PTSD.
On the ongoing litigation, Cavanaugh, a lawyer, said Attorney General Mike Hilgers and his office are giving advice to senators in ways that benefit the ongoing litigation.
“In this case, the attorney general is not representing the interests of the Legislature,” Cavanaugh told reporters. “He’s representing the interests of his office and I think this political agenda that he has continued to pursue before he was attorney general against the legalization of medical cannabis.”
‘Do it the right way’
State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, who has agreed with Hilgers and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., to wait on any related medical cannabis legislation, repeatedly said during the Thursday committee meeting that Hilgers needed his day in court in front of the Supreme Court.
Storm brought his own bill, LB 483, to limit allowable cannabis to 300 milligrams — 0.21% of 5 ounces — and only allow oils or tinctures as acceptable uses.

Cavanaugh and State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, the committee chair, pushed back on Storm and said that the legal process had already played out once at the district court level, and Hilgers lost. Secretary of State Bob Evnen also placed the measures on the ballot, Holdcroft noted, and then voters weighed in. The AG’s Office has threatened to sue if the cannabis commission begins licensing.
Holdcroft acknowledged that should lawmakers pass LB 677, it might end the pending appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court.
Speaking with the Nebraska Examiner, Storm said waiting just a little while could put the legal questions “to bed.” The Legislature is set to adjourn in June, possibly delaying action until early 2026, which could push any regulations more than a year down the road.
Storm told his colleagues that the ongoing lawsuits aren’t Hilgers against the cannabis industry but the AG acting on behalf of the state. Holdcroft and Cavanaugh said voters had spoken.
“I’m all for helping people, and if this ballot initiative comes out that it’s valid and accurate, then I’m all for moving forward to where we can help people,” Storm said. “But I want to do it the right way.”

‘I don’t see a way ahead’
Hansen said, “next session is not it,” and that lawmakers have the chance to act now.
Holdcroft, who opposed advancing LB 677 as is, said he, too, was a “little disappointed” after the work to craft a committee amendment fell short. He said he felt the divide came down on smoking as a “line in the sand,” while Hansen said he felt the flower and bud restriction was the breaking point.
Holdcroft said selling cannabis flower would be a gateway toward recreational marijuana, which Hansen heavily disputed. He has regularly said his bill has nothing to do with recreational marijuana.
“Right now, I don’t see a way ahead,” Holdcroft told the Examiner.
Holdcroft said he hasn’t heard anything of a pull motion yet, but he envisioned there could be a lot of pushback from conservatives in the Legislature. Hansen, who has often taken a Libertarian bent in the Legislature, is a Republican, as is Holdcroft.

‘It’s not over’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, told reporters that the campaign and supporters are no strangers to roadblocks, challenges and “doors shut in our face.” 
Still, she remains confident in crafting the safest and best medical cannabis program and said voters knew what they were voting on.
“This will not be the end,” she said.
To supporters, Eggers said she wants them to know that despite the hiccup, which both she and Hansen thought could be the outcome, “we have every intention to keep fighting.”

This story was originally published by The Appeal.
As U.S. homelessness rates reach record highs, President Donald Trump has pledged to ban street camping, relocate unhoused people to privately-managed “tent cities,” and arrest anyone caught violating the new laws.
But while Trump’s threats certainly sound draconian, they’re not exactly novel. In recent years, several states have organized increasingly harsh homeless sweeps — perhaps most typified by Louisiana, where the governor recently oversaw a possible model for the sort of mass relocation that Trump has promised.
Federal officials seem to be taking note. According to a local official who spoke to The Appeal, in early February, Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem quietly visited a warehouse where Gov. Jeff Landry had relocated nearly 200 homeless people, sometimes under threat of arrest. And in March, Trump appointed Madison Sheahan, a state official whose agency enforced Landry’s crackdown, to become deputy director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for comment.
Sheahan, who is 28, was appointed secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) by Landry in 2023, though she had no background in conservation or ecology. She previously worked on Noem’s campaign for South Dakota governor and was executive director of the Republican Party there, where she worked on banning trans athletes from college sports. Otherwise, her qualifications are questionable: besides issuing rules for sawfish harvesting and letting military veterans hunt bears, Sheahan’s most relevant experience over the last year seems to be lending her officers to Landry to round up homeless residents.



Attorneys for the unhoused have now filed a class action suit against the state — including Sheahan’s LDWF — to block Landry’s crackdown. As the case unfolds in New Orleans’ civil district court, Louisiana’s situation could serve as a bellwether for how Trump 2.0 will address unsheltered homelessness—and even the detention of migrants.
Jesse Rabinowitz, communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center, called Sheahan’s promotion “really concerning.” He added that what’s happening in New Orleans is “a real-life example of what could happen on a larger scale.”
The sweeps by Louisiana state agencies are part of “how conservative electives can punish people living in more progressive parts of the state,” warned Rabinowitz. “They did it with migrants, and they’ve said they’re going to do it with homeless folks. And we have to believe them.”

Louisiana’s crackdown began during singer Taylor Swift’s October tour dates in New Orleans. In the days leading up to the concerts, Landry directed Louisiana State Police (LSP) and LDWF officers to “sweep” downtown encampments of hundreds of unhoused people, pushing them all into one designated area a few blocks away. The sweeps drew national attention.
City council members and Mayor LaToya Cantrell condemned Landry’s actions. One council member’s chief of staff later said in an affidavit that, when she visited the government-run encampment, “one gentleman asked me where he could get a tent,” because state officers had thrown his away.
As a result, she said, “he got bitten by rats the night before because he did not have a tent to go inside.”
Lawyers representing unhoused people swiftly sued. But the ensuing court battle took a worrying turn in January, when the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that cities cannot abridge the state’s police power. LSP can now conduct sweeps without following city ordinances, meaning they don’t have to provide sufficient warning beforehand. That ruling could signal to other red states that courts will let them send state agencies into blue cities, such as Austin or Nashville, and ignore any municipal-level protections in place.
A week after that ruling, LSP and DWF officers again descended on downtown New Orleans’ encampments. This time, they sent more than 100 people to a warehouse seven miles away called the “Transition Center.” Attorneys for the unhoused demanded another restraining order, but courts denied the request.
“Governor Landry’s interest in moving the encampments was to provide warm shelter and a place for the unhoused to be secure from potential harm during the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras,” a judge wrote.

The Transition Center sat in a former packaging warehouse alongside New Orleans’ industrial canal. While the press was not allowed in, photos shared from within the Center show rows of cots separated by black cloths, and some couches facing a television, in a warehouse with no eye-level windows. Residents reportedly received three meals daily and could leave freely, though neither a bus stop nor sidewalk sits near the site. Access was restricted to those with authorization.
Several service organizations worked in the warehouse. After initial difficulties, some employees say the remaining residents were satisfied with conditions. A medical worker told The Appeal he appreciated seeing patients consistently, and “we were able to get people healthier than when they arrived.”
Now that those events have finished, the warehouse has closed.


SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

After the initial October sweeps, a judge ordered LSP and LDWF to “not destroy or dispose of the property of unhoused people without judicial process” and to provide notice of sweeps as set out in New Orleans’ municipal ordinances.
But the New Year’s Day truck attack that killed 14 people in New Orleans, including a sleeping unhoused person, seems to have changed the calculus. Within hours, Landry issued an executive ordergiving him emergency powers to “direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population, from any stricken or threatened area.” The following week, the Louisiana Supreme Court dissolved the preliminary injunction. One justice wrote that, in the wake of the Jan. 1 attack, the sweeps were “about public safety.”
Court affidavits show how the case has already emboldened police to criminalize people experiencing homelessness.
According to the lawsuit, 12 LDWF officers and “five or six” LSP troopers approached 32-year-old plaintiff Raymond Scott when the major sweeps began in January. Scott is unhoused and has already lost valuables during sweeps. Last summer, a city worker reached into his tent and took a treasured owl figurine Scott inherited from his great-grandmother, then disposed of it even as Scott “begged them not to take it,” according to a court affidavit he later filed.
“You have two choices,” a trooper said. “Come willingly, or we cuff you, detain you, and bring you to the Transition Center.”
Scott said he didn’t want to go.
“You know you can be arrested for being homeless now?” a trooper allegedly replied. Scott then said he wanted to call his lawyer.
Scott’s attorneys argue that the US Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling in Grants Pass v. Johnson does not permit Landry’s sweeps, since Grants Pass concerned whether arresting people for sleeping outside violates the 8th Amendment’s protections against cruel and unusual punishments. In this case, the attorneys allege Louisiana violated unhoused residents’ 4th and 14th Amendment rights.
Another resident, Michael Garner, asserts in the suit that seven or eight LSP troopers approached his camp and told him to pack up. When he asked if he could leave, a trooper said he was being detained.
“The troopers told me that I would not be free to leave until I was brought to the Transition Center,” Garner wrote. He says he packed everything he owned into a box and got on the bus. When he later tried to fetch his belongings — including his social security card, birth certificate, and a bicycle —“officials told me that they could not find the box.”
Last week, attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the suit voluntarily. The legal team declined to comment on that request, as the motion is pending.
Sheahan, who’s set to begin her role at ICE in the coming weeks, ran the LDWF when its officers conducted the sweeps. In a March 11 Fraternal Order of Police statement celebrating her promotion, Patrick Yoes, National President of the FOP, celebrated that she’d “established a Special Operations Group within the enforcement division” for events like the Super Bowl. According to a November Facebook post, state police officers trained LDWF’s new special-ops team. Sheahan also joined Landry and DHS Secretary Noem for a briefing on Super Bowl security measures when Noem visited in February.
LDWF agents typically enforce hunting, fishing, and boating regulations. An LDWF spokesperson did not answer questions about why the agency took part in homeless sweeps.



Advocates have decried the sweeps and “transition center” as both cruel and ineffective. But at the state level, officials have celebrated their success.
“We think this is absolutely going to be looked at as a success, because we were able to get people out of harm’s way just weeks after a terror attack in that same area,” a spokesperson for the Louisiana Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (GOHSEP) told The Appeal. The state closed the Transition Center on March 21.

The spokesperson said that, from a peak of 183 people, 108, or about 60 percent, received permanent housing by the time the center closed.
An additional 59 people left on their own, while 15 others moved into a different shelter downtown. The center’s final costs could exceed $17.5 million.
But some housing advocates say the sweeps undermined the city-level housing efforts that have been ongoing since 2023. Those programs have housed more than 822 people at a much lower cost per person. Critics also say the warehouse sweeps disrupted contact between unhoused people and their case workers and service providers. The National Homelessness Law Center’s Rabinowitz stressed that the only real fix is affordable housing.
“There’s consensus that housing solves homelessness, and throwing people in jail and forcing homeless people into camps is not the solution,” he said. “But the people that are put in charge don’t seem to be motivated by helping people. They seem to be motivated by this desire to police and punish people for struggling in a country where a lot of people are struggling to make ends meet.”

Montana Health officials have announced five confirmed cases of measles in Gallatin County.
The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services along with the Gallatin City-County Health Department in Bozeman confirmed its the first instance of the highly infectious disease since 1990.
The individuals are children and adults who were exposed to measles while traveling outside of Montana. The cases reside in Gallatin County and are currently isolated at home. All five individuals are unvaccinated, or vaccine status is unknown.
The Gallatin City-County Health Department continues to assess any potential exposures while the individuals were contagious and are contacting the people who may have been exposed, commonly referred to as “contact tracing.” People potentially exposed are being provided with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for.
The Gallatin health department has determined that there are points of exposure to the general public. Potential exposures to the public can be found on the GCCHD website and will be updated as needed or as more information becomes available. The spread of measles can occur before people know they have the disease, and before any rash appears. The times listed on the website include the period when the exposure occurred and two hours after.
Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.
“While it is unfortunate to have cases of measles after 35 years of disease inactivity in Montana, we have been working diligently with our local partners to prepare,” said DPHHS Public Health Physician Dr. Maggie Cook-Shimanek. “We are confident that our public health and clinical partners will work together and address this situation as quickly as possible. It is important for everyone to know their vaccination status and to visit with their health department or health care provider if they are unsure.”

If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:

Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
Check your home state immunization registries.

Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
“Measles is highly contagious and highly preventable with vaccination, and ensuring people are immunized remains our best defense. If people are unable to find their vaccine records, there are no contraindications to receiving an additional dose,” said Dr. Peter Bulger, Gallatin City-County Health Department medical director.
Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.
The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.
If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, please call your primary care physician as soon as possible.
“We are actively working with individuals who are experiencing symptoms,”said Lori Christenson, Gallatin City-County Health Officer. “We greatly appreciate the cooperation of those involved in helping mitigate further exposures. We encourage anyone who is not vaccinated or unsure of their vaccination history to consider vaccination and to contact your health care provider or GCCHD. By getting vaccinated we protect ourselves and others around us from infection.”
There is no cure for measles once the outbreak has started. It’s a virus and medical professionals treat the symptoms related to the infection.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa House passed two measures Thursday that would set new educational requirements in Iowa’s K-12 school system — one requiring high school students pass the U.S. citizenship test to graduate and another requiring students in grades 5-12 to be shown fetal development videos and graphics.
Senate File 369, sent to Gov. Kim Reynolds, would require Iowa high schools to pass the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services naturalization civics test to graduate, beginning in the 2026-27 school year. Students need to earn at least a 60% to pass, and those who fail will be allowed to take the test as many times as necessary to earn a passing grade.
Similar graduation requirements have been implemented in other states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky and Wisconsin. Reynolds has advocated for Iowa to have a USCIS civics test requirement in previous legislative sessions, but the measure had failed to make it to her desk.

Rep. Bob Henderson, R-Sioux City, floor manager for the bill, said the measure ensures that young people have a minimum standard of knowledge about the U.S. government as they become old enough to vote and participate in the country’s government system.
“Fundamental to the process of running our government is a good knowledge of the framework of our government,” Henderson said. “We require that someone who’s transferring their citizenship from another country to ours offer proof that they know a bit about that framework, after which they are given the privilege of being able to have a say in our country’s government. Why would we not have at least the same requirement of the proof of the knowledge of that framework for someone who now is poised to enter that same responsibility, simply because they have lived to a certain age?”
There were several amendments filed on the measure. Rep. Chad Ingels, R-Randalia, proposed increasing the current one-semester requirement for civics instruction to one year, in an amendment he withdrew. Rep. Elinor Levin, D-Iowa City, proposed an amendment to requiring Iowa legislators take the USCIS naturalization civics test and have results published in the daily journal, and another providing students the option to pursue a civics service project as an alternative to the test — both of which were voted down.
Levin criticized the measure for its emphasis on testing, which she said is not an effective way to make students more civically engaged. Levin, alongside other Democrats, said the bill will place both a new, unfunded mandate on schools and a new hurdle for students seeking to graduate from Iowa high schools.
“This bill is a bad idea,” Levin said. “It doesn’t meet the moment, it doesn’t engage students. Instead, it puts in front of them 100-question multiple choice test that may scare them, because it may stop them from graduating.”
Levin said at a time when Iowa has just returned to pre-pandemic graduation rates, the new requirement could be the deciding factor for whether a student graduates high school or not.
“I’m worried about the kid who’s just planning to graduate high school because their parent had told them that is the one thing they care about, or their grandparents told them that that’s the one thing they care about,” Levin said. “And now they’re going to take the test the first time — let’s say their sophomore year, right after they finished their civics class — and they don’t pass it, they get a 54%. And they say, ‘Well, I can either spend the next three years retaking this dumb thing, or next year, when I turn 17, I could drop out, and say sorry, Mom, the state made it impossible for me to graduate.'”
Henderson said the bill, passed 60-33, should “be thought of as an encouragement to knowledge, not a barrier to graduation.”
“Will the knowledge of the heritage and the history and the framework of our country alone make a good citizen?” Henderson said. “No, but a lack of that knowledge is almost certain to prevent a person from becoming a good contributing citizen. And sadly, there can be found an abundance of examples of that in our current situation.”
House approves fetal development education bill with ban on material from abortion providers
Lawmakers also passed Senate File 175 in a 60-30 vote Thursday. The legislation, passed by the Senate in a 31-13 vote in February, is this year’s version of the “Meet Baby Olivia” bill — though it does not mention the video developed by anti-abortion group Live Action by name. The bill would require students in grades 5 through 12 be shown ultrasound video and computer-generated rendering or animations depicting “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization” in human growth and development classes. 
Rep. Helena Hayes, R-New Sharon, said the measure is not about abortion, but  “challenges us to see value, beauty and dignity in every stage of human life.”
“It’s not teaching about abortion, it brings humanity into the classroom,” Hayes said. “It allows students to witness human development through high-definition ultrasounds and authentic imagery – we have that technology. … It’s biology, it’s anatomy, it’s science.”
At subcommittee meetings on the bill, critics said it was promoting anti-abortion material in public school classrooms and could lead to the distribution of medically inaccurate information. As the bill was amended by House lawmakers to include a provision banning materials on fetal development to be shown in classrooms from an entity that performs or “promotes” abortion, or that contracts, affiliates, or makes referrals to such organizations, Democrats argued that many reputable medical organizations would be disqualified.
Hayes said this language was included to ensure information on fetal development is coming from sources in line with the requirement in the bill to depict the “humanity” of the fetus.
“Perhaps some of the entities that perform abortions, promote abortion, affiliate, refer, contract with those that do, I would propose that those are antithetical to … the humanity of the unborn child occurs in the womb,” Hayes said.
In a back and forth with Hayes, Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, questioned what organizations would be qualify as the “leading professional organizations and agencies with relevant expertise in the field” listed in the bill, the entities identified as being able to decide if information is medically accurate and research-based — requirements for material that can be shown in classrooms.
Hayes mentioned the Mayo Clinic, a health care provider, as one of the potential organizations to be referred to as a leading professional source on this topic. Baeth said his understanding of the amendment language was that material from the Mayo Clinic could not be included in school classrooms on this subject, as the Mayo Clinic performs abortions when necessary to protect the life of the mother.
Though Hayes said the state Board of Education will adopt rules to administer and interpret the language in the bill, she agreed with Baeth that the bill’s language did not include specification on entities that perform elective versus medically necessary abortions.
Baeth said the amendment would functionally ban material from legitimate research organizations that work on issues related to human gestation.
“I find it very hard for anyone reading this amendment — if they’re going to read it by the letter of the law, should this become law, this will ban the use of information coming from our research institutions,” Baeth said. “… You’re asking for research-based information to be provided — that research is done at institutions that have some sort of association with abortions that are at least performed to protect the life of a mother.”
Planned Parenthood Advocates of Iowa criticizing the measure in a Thursday news release as a step to “further politicizing Iowa’s classrooms and youth.”
“Iowans do not want their children used as political pawns, but the people elected to represent them continue to steamroll them with deeply unpopular policies like this that undermine our youth and put their futures at risk,” Gabriela Fuentes, advocacy strategist manager for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Iowa said in a statement. “More than 1,200 Iowans have already spoken out against this bill. It’s time our lawmakers listen. And, make no mistake, Iowans will hold them accountable.”
The measure returns to the Iowa Senate for consideration of the amendment before it would go to the governor’s desk.

(Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail on Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
A Florida Highway Patrol trooper arrested Lopez-Gomez after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger. The 20-year-old is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up despite his first-degree misdemeanor charge being dropped.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,’” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
A lieutenant working in the Leon County Jail didn’t allow the mother to see Lopez-Gomez on Thursday and told her officials were working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on how to proceed. A Phoenix reporter accompanied Gomez-Perez to the jail.
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
 
‘I can’t do anything for their brother’
The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
The Homeland Security Investigations Office in Tampa issued the 48-hour ICE detainer on Thursday. An ICE officer whose name and phone number appear in the detainer refused to speak with the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
The state trooper pulled over the car Lopez-Gomez was in because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report. Lopez-Gomez gave his Georgia state ID to the trooper, who wrote in his report that Lopez-Gomez said he was in the country illegally.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.

April 10, 2025 | ScreenshotMegan Cavanagh is now officially the chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court.
One day after former Chief Justice Elizabeth Clement’s departure, on Tuesday, Chief Justice Cavanagh began her tenure heading up the state’s highest court.
Clement announced in February that she was leaving the court no later than April 30 to become president of the Virginia-based National Center for State Courts, a nonprofit that provides assistance and resources to courts both nationally and around the world.
Cavanagh, who was selected by her fellow jurists last month to take over the role, was first elected to the Michigan Supreme Court in 2018 after being nominated by the Democratic Party. She serves as the court’s liaison on child welfare issues, tribal courts and as chair of the Commission on Well-Being in the Law among her other administrative responsibilities. Cavanagh previously served as co-lead on the Child Protective Legal Representation Task Force.
Clement’s departure will give Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, the opportunity to appoint someone to fill the remainder of the term, which runs through 2026.
Although state Supreme Court candidates appear on the nonpartisan section of the ballot, state parties nominate candidates to run for the position. 
Clement was appointed by former Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, in November 2017 and ran for a full eight-year term after being nominated by Republicans in 2018. 
Her departure will shift the court from a 5-2 Democratic-nominated majority to a 6-1 majority, with Justice Brian Zahra as the lone Republican-nominated jurist on the court. His term runs through 2030, at which point he will be 70 and ineligible to run again.
It’s not known when Whitmer will announce her pick to succeed Clement, but until she does the court will operate with just six justices.

Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, speaks on the Senate floor on April 17, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Senate approved a bill Thursday establishing Education Savings Accounts for private school students, but details are likely to be worked out by a conference committee.
The Senate voted 27-20 in favor of an amended version of House Bill 1540, which would provide vouchers for families to use for private school tuition or other qualifying education expenses. The accounts would not be available to public school or homeschooled students.
The amount each family could receive varies based on household income. Students from families in the lowest income category could receive about $4,000 per year, while students from the highest income category could receive a little over $1,000 per year. 
Families with high incomes would qualify for vouchers in the version of the bill senators advanced. A previous version of the bill limited the vouchers to families who fall within 400% of the federal poverty level, which is an annual income of $128,600 for a family of four.
The Education Saving Accounts would be available for students for the 2026-27 school year. 
Sen. Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, who introduced the amendment, estimated the program would cost about $20 million per school year. The exact cost to the state would depend on how many students use the accounts.
Bills look to expand North Dakota student opportunities through savings accounts

Sen. Mike Wobbema, R-Valley City, was among those who spoke in favor of Education Savings Accounts. 
“We need to recognize that taxpayer funds need to be prioritized for use in educating taxpayers’ children,” Wobbema said.
He argued that Education Savings Accounts could save the state money over time, if public school students switch to private schools, reducing how much the state spends on per-pupil payments to public schools.
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, voted against the bill. She said there are no private schools in her district, so the bill wouldn’t be used by her constituents.
“If we’re going to do school choice, it’s got to be for all kids,” Myrdal said. “I can’t in true conscience stand here today to vote for a vehicle that doesn’t give any power to the parents in my district.”
Axtman is the chief sponsor of a competing Education Savings Account bill, Senate Bill 2400, which is still under consideration by the House Education Committee. The key difference in that bill is dollars could be used for educational expenses for public school or homeschooled students in addition to private school students.
Axtman voted in favor of the Senate version, but said she’s still hopeful for a more universal policy.
“My goal is still a very comprehensive ESA that affects, truly, all students in North Dakota,” she said.
North Dakota United, a union representing educators and public sector employees, is among those who oppose the Education Savings Account bills.
“This bill, 1540, is all about private schools, just public money given right to the private schools,” said Nick Archuleta, president of North Dakota United.
The bill is expected to head to a conference committee made up of three lawmakers from each legislative chamber.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas PBS CEO and Executive Director Courtney Pledger, whose eight-year tenure included multiple conflicts with the state Legislature, will step down in May, the agency announced Thursday in a news release.
Pledger took over the state’s educational public television network in 2017. She “leaves behind a legacy of transformative leadership and innovative growth across content, education, and community engagement,” the PBS news release states.

In a statement, Pledger said she appreciated “building a phenomenal team eager to take on new challenges and collaborating with some of the very best independent creators and community partners in Arkansas.”
“It has been my great honor to lead Arkansas PBS through a transformative time that points to the limitless potential of our statewide public media network,” said Pledger, who is also the vice chair of PBS’ 27-member national board of directors.
The “transformative time” included the COVID-19 pandemic, during which Arkansas PBS broadened its resources for K-12 students while schools were closed.
The agency also started providing live high school sports coverage and online archives of state government meetings during Pledger’s tenure, according to the news release.
“Her tenure marked a deepening of Arkansas PBS’s community relevance, with an expanded multi-platform presence, robust social media engagement, and popular in-person events,” the news release states.
West Doss, chairman of the Arkansas Educational Television Commission, said in an interview that Pledger decided months ago to leave the agency. He said Pledger has been “a big part of some incredible growth and new initiatives that we’ve done” and is “well-respected by our commission.”
The commission will meet Monday morning to discuss Pledger’s departure, and applications to succeed her will be open soon, Doss said.

 Disputes over funding and audits

In the past few years, Arkansas PBS has faced legislative obstacles to its ability to spend its money. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, has been the Legislature’s most vocal critic of Arkansas PBS, and he unsuccessfully tried to reduce Arkansas PBS’ spending authority in the 2022 and 2024 fiscal sessions.
Arkansas PBS’ funds include approximately $5.8 million from state general revenue, $2.5 million from the federal Corporation for Public Broadcasting and $1.7 million in private donations, agency Chief Financial Officer Jason Kunau said in February.
Arkansas PBS’ spending authority has repeatedly faced resistance in the Arkansas House. Appropriations need approval from three-fourths of lawmakers, and PBS’ fiscal year 2026 appropriation required five attempts to get 76 House members’ support.
Earlier this year, Pledger urged lawmakers not to abolish the Arkansas Educational Television Commission, which oversees Arkansas PBS’ programs and finances. A proposed law from Sullivan would have moved the commission’s powers and authorities to the state Department of Education; Arkansas PBS is already under the department’s umbrella but operates independently.
The agency would have stood to lose funding via grants and donations if it no longer had an independent board, Pledger told a Senate committee.
Sullivan disputed the claim that the agency could have lost funding for its services, which include the state’s emergency alert system.
However, the Department of Education would have faced an “expensive and time-consuming” effort to obtain Arkansas PBS’ Federal Communications Commission license if the agency’s governance changed, according to a Washington, D.C. law firm that specializes in telecommunications law.

Lawmakers OK fresh audit into Arkansas PBS’ purchases, procedures as far back as July 2021

 

The agency came under legislative scrutiny in 2023 when its regularly scheduled 2022 audit indicated that administrators might have sidestepped state laws related to contract bidding. Purchases of more than $20,000 would have triggered a bidding process, and the network made several purchases just below that threshold from the same company, according to the 2022 audit.
A specially requested audit of the network’s expenditures, purchasing procedures and “internal controls” from July 1, 2021 to Dec. 30, 2023, concluded last year, with auditors referring the findings to a prosecuting attorney.
Pledger told lawmakers the agency had no intention to break or circumvent state law and had learned from its “mistakes and errors.”
While both audits remained unresolved, a legislative subcommittee tabled a potential merit pay raise for Pledger at Sullivan’s urging in August 2023 and tabled an appropriation request from the agency later that year because Pledger had missed some scheduled appearances before committees. Lawmakers said her absence was disrespectful; the network’s then-chief financial officer said Pledger missed a meeting due to illness.
After the proposal to abolish the PBS commission passed the Senate in February, Doss and Sullivan said they reached an agreement that led Sullivan to leave the commission alone. The panel convenes four times a year and will next meet in June.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed Sullivan’s wife, Maria Sullivan, to the Arkansas Educational Television Commission last year. Doss said Maria Sullivan is set to lead an Arkansas PBS task force aimed at better serving homeschoolers, which is a high priority for her husband.

(Photo courtesy of the Oregon Department of Transportation/Flickr)Fred Cuozzo barely made it out of the South Obenchain Fire that burned through his home, barn, pumphouse and garage in Eagle Point, north of Medford, on Sept. 8, 2020.
Three years later, PacifiCorp — owner of Oregon private utility Pacific Power — was found by a jury to have been reckless and negligent in causing that fire and three others. In January 2024, a jury ordered the utility company to pay millions in damages to Cuozzo and nine other survivors, among the first group in an ongoing class action lawsuit.
Cuozzo still has not seen that settlement money because PacifiCorp is appealing the jury’s verdict. In three months, Cuozzo turns 80. He fears he might not in his lifetime see that money — money he needs to rebuild.
“I’ve been waiting almost five years since my home, contents and four other structures burned up,” he said. “I think they’re just waiting, trying to wait people out, and they can get tired of waiting or die, right?”
The Oregon Legislature is considering a bill that would do something about that, and it’s moving through the session with bipartisan support and little fanfare.
Senate Bill 926, sponsored by state Sen. David Brock Smith, R-Port Orford, and co-sponsored by Democratic state Sens. Jeff Golden of Ashland and James Manning of Eugene, would impose some consequences on PacifiCorp, and the state’s two other investor-owned utilities, for delaying settlements and prolonging litigation if they are found to have recklessly or negligently caused a wildfire.
On April 8, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s four Democrats voted to pass it out of the committee and onto the Senate floor, recommending they also vote yes. The committee’s two Republicans opposed the bill. The larger Senate vote has not yet been scheduled.
Golden said he only recently learned about the bill and signed on as a sponsor.
“I am interested in faster settlements. I’m not interested in rate increases or favorable treatment (for utilities) until people who have been waiting for a remedy get it,” he said.
Unlike other bills this session related to private utilities and wildfire risk that have been more controversial — including bills to shield utilities from some financial liabilities, and one bill that would have prohibited utilities from raising rates if they had ongoing wildfire suits — Senate Bill 926 appears to be meeting little friction. Only one person spoke at its first public hearing in March: a father of three in Albany who supports the bill and expressed frustration over his rising electricity costs. Brock Smith, the bill’s chief sponsor, did not give testimony during the bill’s first hearing or in the run-up to the judiciary committee’s vote. He also didn’t respond to calls, emails or texts about the bill.
Utility companies oppose the bill. Portland General Electric lobbyist Greg Alderson called it “problematically broad” in a letter submitted to the committee two days after the hearing.
PacifiCorp spokesman Simon Gutierrez, said in an email to the Capital Chronicle on Tuesday that the company strongly opposes the bill, though it has not yet submitted any formal testimony against it.
The bill was amended after public comment closed, unfairly and fundamentally altering the original bill without the opportunity to weigh in on the changes, both utilities contend.
Imposing consequences
Senate Bill 926 would prohibit Oregon’s private investor-owned utilities from recovering wildfire lawsuit costs from ratepayers — including fines, fees and settlements — if the company was found by a court or jury to have acted recklessly or negligently in causing the fire. It would also prohibit companies from raising rates to pay for repairing or replacing wildfire-damaged infrastructure if the company is found by court or jury to have been at fault for the fire.
Electric utilities indebted by a wildfire judgment would not be allowed to send dividends, income, interest or profits to corporate owners and shareholders and would pay 9% interest on any damages awarded to wildfire victims starting from the date of the fire, rather than the date the damages are awarded.
The bill would apply retroactively to all powerline-ignited wildfires since Jan. 1, 2020. For a company like PacifiCorp, that could mean millions in interest on cases that have been awaiting trial for years, and limits to the utilities’ now annual requests to raise rates.
“It is astounding that Senate leadership in the Oregon legislature is seeking to insert themselves into ongoing litigation involving PacifiCorp by retroactively imposing costs in the millions under a scheme that would apply to no other business in the state,” Gutierrez said.
He added that in light of a recent report from the Oregon Department of Forestry that concluded PacifiCorp did not start fires it was previously found to have started in the Santiam Canyon, the bill should be reconsidered.
That state report refutes statements from first responders from the U.S. Forest Service and months of trial testimony about the origins of the fires, and is unlikely to be admissible in PacifiCorp’s appeal because the company in 2023 moved to exclude all government reports at trial.

He was found deceased in the Sigler House, the president’s residence, in the late morning of April 17 during a wellness check after failing to appear for morning meetings, said Simpson College Board of Trustees Chair Terry Handley during a news conference.
It was “extremely unusual” for Byers to miss meetings, Handley said, and after staff was unable to reach him, a wellness check was conducted with the aid of the Indianola Police Department.
“This is stunning and devastating news to all of us here on campus,” Handley said.

Police Chief Brian Sher said he believes no criminal element was involved in Byers’ death, but provided no further comment due to the open investigation into the incident. Byers was alone in the house when they found him.

While Byers and his family did not live in the president’s residence full time, Handley said he used it as a “point of focus” for activities and events.
“My heart breaks for the Simpson community, the Indianola community, President Byers’s family and his many, many friends,” Sher said.
April 18 classes have been canceled and grief counselors will be made available for students and staff, Handley said. He and other university leaders will meet in the morning to begin discussing next steps for selecting an interim president and additional details will be shared next week.
A 1993 graduate of Simpson, Byers was announced as president of his alma mater in July 2023 after serving as president and CEO of the Greater Des Moines Partnership. In his tenure as president, Byers oversaw the implementation of new scholarship programs for incoming students and formed partnerships with other institutions with the goal of elevating the university.
Handley said Byers’ love and passion for the Simpson campus and community was “infectious,” and helped him rise above other candidates during the presidential search. Byers was known and loved beyond Simpson as well, he added, and was recognized locally and at the state and federal levels for his work.
“Jay has had a tremendous amount of influence and impact during his career, and this will take some time, but we will take that time to grieve, we will take our time to recover, and then we will move forward,” Handley said. “That’s exactly what Jay would expect.”

(Capital-Star photo by Peter Hall)Mack Trucks will lay off between 250 and 350 workers at its Lehigh Valley Operations center outside Allentown over the next three months, due to economic uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs, a company spokesperson said Thursday.
“Heavy-duty truck orders continue to be negatively affected by market uncertainty about freight rates and demand, possible regulatory changes, and the impact of tariffs,” spokesperson Kimberly Pupillo said.
“Today we informed our employees that this unfortunately means we’ll have to lay off 250-350 people at LVO over the next 90 days,” Pupillo said. “We regret having to take this action, but we need to align production with reduced demand for our vehicles.”
Union leaders announced the company had confirmed layoffs Thursday afternoon. The plant in Macungie employs around 1,200 workers.
“Due to the market being in decline, there will be a rate and line reduction. I have heard all the same rumors you guys have heard. This is the first time I have an official word from the company that there will be a layoff,” United Auto Workers Local 677 shop chair Tim Hertzog said in a letter posted on the union’s Facebook page Thursday.
State Rep. Josh Siegel (D-Lehigh) said the layoffs are “a clear signal of the dangerous economic instability being fueled by the Trump administration’s chaotic tariff policies.”
“The tariffs — erratic, broad and poorly targeted — are crushing core U.S. industries like trucking and manufacturing. Supply chains are snarled, costs are soaring, and confidence among employers is collapsing,” Siegel said in a news release.
President Donald Trump said on the campaign trail last year that tariffs would return manufacturing to the United States and generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury.
At the beginning of April, Trump announced tariffs on products imported from other countries beginning a universal 10% duty and increasing with additional reciprocal tariffs as high as 50% against countries with large trade deficits or other barriers to exports.
The announcement sparked a massive stock market sell-off that erased trillions of dollars in value that was followed by the largest single-day increase when Trump announced a 90-day reprieve for most countries. He doubled down on tariffs for Chinese imports, raising the duties to 125%.
Siegel called on U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District), whose district includes the Lehigh County Mack plant, and Senators John Fetterman (D-Pa.) and Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) to “take back Congress’s constitutional authority on trade and end this economic sabotage before more livelihoods are lost.”

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA) A bill advanced from the Iowa House Thursday that would regulate anaerobic digesters, or systems that break down organic material in an oxygen-deprived system to produce usable biogas and fertilizer, at animal feeding operations. 
House File 989 would task the Iowa Department of Natural Resources with regulating the construction, expansion, placement and operation of anaerobic digesters and associated structures that hold manure feedstocks at animal feeding operations. 
The bill describes anaerobic digestion in three steps. First the feedstock, both liquid and dry animal waste, is stored. Next, the feedstock is “digested” in a structure specifically designed for anaerobic digestion. As the material is broken in the digester, the bio gas is extracted. The final step takes the leftover material, called the digestate, and either stores it or applies it as organic material to farmland. 
Rep. Mike Sexton, R-Rockwell City, said the bill draws a “distinct line” between animal feeding operations and anaerobic digesters so the two can be enforced properly. 
Sexton said under current regulations, any compliance issues that happen with an anaerobic digester are put on the livestock operation because the digesters don’t have their own licenses with the state. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Under the bill, operators would have to apply for a construction permit from DNR before building an anaerobic digester, or any of the related storage structures. This permit would require information on things like construction, size, operators and how the digestate would be applied. 
The bill states anaerobic digesters must comply with separation distances for clean air regulations and follow the same water quality separation distances put on animal feeding operations. The bill lists civil penalties for operations that do not comply with these regulations. 
According to data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Iowa has fewer than 10 anaerobic digesters on livestock operations — most are at dairies. 
Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, spoke in support of the bill, but said she hopes for more conversation moving forward on the impacts to the environment and health. 
“There (are) remaining environmental concerns, there’s health concerns around this technology, and I believe that there should be a lot more robust conversation going forward,” James said.
An article from the Iowa Chapter of the Sierra Club called the Iowa bill a “bandaid on a bigger problem” with the agricultural industry. The environmental group, which registered against HF 989, said the bill does not provide adequate separation distances from houses and other structures and will encourage animal feeding operations to expand. 
Sexton said he does not believe the regulations will inspire more concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, to be built in Iowa because “there’s just not that much money in farming right now.”
“These anaerobic digesters are going to get built on existing animal feeding operations,” Sexton said. 
Anaerobic digestion can generate renewable energy from other feedstocks, including things like food waste. Sexton has also worked on an additional bill, House File 987, that would create regulations for “community anaerobic digester systems” that use organic material other than animal manure. 
Sexton said his amendment to HF 989, which passed, brought the language in line with the other digester bill. 
PFAS amendment 
Rep. Monica Kurth, D-Davenport, filed an amendment to the bill that would require testing the materials in the digester structure for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl, commonly known as PFAS, substances. 
“They are everywhere, and they are aptly named forever chemicals because they don’t break down, they don’t go away,” Kurth said. 
Kurth said the amendment would prevent digestate with high levels of PFAS from being applied to the land. 
The amendment is similar to House File 723, which required water treatment plants to test sewage sludge for PFAS, and notify landowners of the results before the sludge was applied as fertilizer. HF 723 did not advance ahead of the legislative funnel deadlines. 
Sexton urged the body to reject the amendment and said DNR would have opportunities to write additional rules on such matters.
“I appreciate the amendment, but Iowa’s farmers are very concerned about what they put on their farm ground,” Sexton said. “They’re the ones that have to live there. They’re the ones that have their livestock on that ground.” 
Kurth’s amendment failed, 59-32. 
Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, said he had several concerns with what he perceived as loopholes in the bill, but said he appreciated the efforts on HF 989, especially in comparison to the anaerobic digestion policy in the governor’s energy bill, that he said was “very concerning.” 
The bill will advance to the Senate, and Sexton said he hopes to see the community digester bill advancing soon.

(Stock photo by Oliver Helbig/Getty Images)A proposal that would lift the anonymity of people filing complaints against a law enforcement officers advanced in a Florida House committee on Thursday, even though key players in Florida law enforcement are divided about whether the legislation is truly “Backing the Blue.”
The proposal sponsored by Miami-Dade Republican Tom Fabricio (HB 317) would require a person who initially files an anonymous complaint about a law or corrections officer in the state to have to give up his or her anonymity before any interrogation of that officer can commence.
Both the Florida Sheriffs Association and the Florida Police Chiefs Association oppose the bill.
“It will not increase accountability,” said Tampa International Airport Police Department Chief Charlie Vasquez, who is serving as president of the Florida Police Chiefs Association. “It will make it more difficult to hold officers accountable when they have serious misconduct.”
But other parts of the law enforcement community do support the measure, such as the Florida Fraternal Order of Police.
A member of that organization, Miami Police officer Felix Del Rosario, said the proposal is about fairness, integrity, “and the protection of those who dedicate their lives to public service.”
Del Rosario added that, for too long, police officers in Florida have been subjected to “prolonged and ambiguous investigations.”
“This legislation helps address those inequities,” he said, “by ensuring that officers have timely access to their complete investigative file, providing safeguards against unfounded and malicious allegations that can have long lasting affects on an officers’ reputation, career, and upholding the principals of.due process and equal treatment under the law.”
‘I also back the Black’
Orange County Democratic Rep. LaVon Bracy Davis noted how the Legislature last year effectively eliminated civilian review boards designed to oversee certain local law enforcement, which was supported by the sheriffs and police chiefs, so why wouldn’t they support those agencies on this piece of legislation?
“I feel like I’m in an alternate universe right now because I hear from this chamber, from this committee, often times that we need to ‘Back the Blue.’ And the Blue just spoke. What I wrote down from the police chief is that this bill will make it more difficult to hold officers accountable when they participate in misconduct,” she said.
And Bracy Davis, who is Black, said she was speaking as a representative of a minority-majority district with constituents who in some cases “have apprehension when it comes to dealing with police officers.”
“So, not only do I ‘Back the Blue’, but I also back the Black, and I back the Brown.”
Rep. Bruce Antone, who also is Black, said he opposed the bill which, ultimately would repeal anonymity for a complainant once law enforcement begins interrogating the accused officer. Antone listed three separate occasions when he was harassed by law enforcement.
South Florida Democratic Rep. Mike Gottlieb said he disagreed with the notion that if he opposed the bill he somehow was not ‘Backing the Blue.’
“We have many masters, and in a bill like this we have the administration, we have the rank and file, the law enforcement officers who are on the street fighting day and day out to protect the society, and we have the citizens, and each one of us represents approximately 175,000 individuals,” he said. “And to come here and tell us that if we vote no on this product we don’t ‘Back the Blue?’ That’s just not true.”
‘You put your face on it’
But Republicans on the committee said that while the administrators and lobbyists for Florida’s top law enforcement agencies oppose the bill, actual cops on the street support it, and that should be good enough.
“All we’re saying is, if you have a complaint against someone,  just like if you’re going to accuse someone in a court of law, put your face on it,” said Hillsborough County GOP Rep. Danny Alvarez, whose job outside of the Legislature is general counsel for the Tampa Police Benevolent Association. “And if you can’t put your face and name on it, then it’s not worthy of going forward and smearing this person for the rest of their career.” 
Alvarez added that the bill was “for the cop, not the sergeant, not the captain, and not the chief.”
Last week, when the bill was heard in the House Government Operations Subcommittee,  Jennifer “Cookie” Pritt, executive director of Florida Police Chiefs Association, gave highly personal testimony regarding an incident involving a herself and a high-ranking command officer as a real life example of why she opposed the bill. She chose not to comment publicly on the measure on Thursday.
Ultimately, the House Judiciary Committee voted 16-4 to advance the bill, and it now moves to the full House for consideration. But it may not end up becoming law this year, as its Senate companion (SB 516) has yet to be heard in any committee in that chamber.

“This bill will be key to the process of securing the safety of our communities. It’s got common sense protections in there and accountability and transparency,” Yarbrough said.

The legislation allows local and state law enforcement agencies to enter into agreements to enforce the country’s immigration laws with federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Currently, the Alabama Attorney General’s Office is the only state entity with that power.
Under the bill, sheriffs’ deputies; police officers and state troopers may also arrest people based on their immigration status “when authorized by federal law.” Law enforcement must also obtain documents to verify a person’s immigration status, be that a passport or a permanent resident card.
The chamber adopted a committee substitute 77-20 that removed some of the requirements. Previously, the Attorney General’s Office was required to publicly name any agency failing to comply with provisions in the legislation and notify the governor’s office, but the amendment gives it the option.
Alabama has low rates of immigration. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, only 4% of Alabama’s population was foreign-born in 2023, compared to 14.3% nationwide. Only 6% of the population speaks a language other than English at home, compared to 22.5% of the U.S. population. 
House Democrats criticized the legislation, saying it trafficked in stereotypes about immigrants without status and that it could discourage cooperation with law enforcement in criminal investigations.  Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, said he was worried about his foreign-born constituents and how the legislation will impact their trust in law enforcement. 
“Bringing local law enforcement into the equation is going to create a lot of fear among people that are not doing anything wrong, that aren’t committing crimes,” Ensler said. “They’re already on edge, and a lot of people are just trying to work hard. They’re trying to better themselves, provide for their families, and I’m just concerned about how this will impact them.”
The bill states that people cannot be detained solely because of their immigration status unless authorized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and that sheriffs’ deputies and police departments will verify that a person has an arrest warrant within 24 hours of the person getting detained.
Rep. Neil Rafferty, D-Birmingham, said it would lead to racial profiling and echoed Ensler saying it will increase local distrust in law enforcement.
“When local police are perceived as immigration agents, victims and witnesses of crimes within immigrant communities become reluctant to come forward,” Rafferty said. “That doesn’t make communities safer. It actually makes it far more dangerous.”
Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said there are more American citizens that commit crimes than people without legal status. Studies have repeatedly proven that. 
“I think that it’s so unfair for us to just focus on one group of people and then with the immigrants that we are attacking,” she said.
Yarbrough said the bill was inspired by Laken Riley, a Georgia college student that was killed by a person without legal status in 2024. He said she would not have been killed if legislation like his existed when a colleague asked him. Rafferty said Riley’s death could have been prevented with better communication between law enforcement about the man accused of killing her. 
“The failure wasn’t in our laws, but in the implementation and coordination between agencies, if it doesn’t address the actual systemic failures and communication between local and federal authorities that actually contributed to this tragedy,” he said.
The House passed the bill 74-26. It now moves to the Senate.

Putting tariffs on lithium imported from China would seem to create more demand, and a higher price, for lithium mined in Nevada.
So why is Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo asking President Donald Trump to remove tariffs on lithium from China? 
Because Nevada also has hopes of becoming a national hub for manufacturing lithium batteries.
And, Lombardo noted in a letter to Trump Thursday, Nevada’s domestic lithium industry “is still in its early stages. At present, there is no domestic technology capable of refining lithium to the standards required for manufacturing while also meeting our country’s environmental regulations. As a result all manufacturing grade lithium is imported from China.”
“As you can imagine,” Lombardo continued in his letter, “this is damaging all United States manufacturing that is dependent on this product.”
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Trump has repeatedly condemned and attempted to nullify by clawing back funding, a Department of Energy loan program provided $2 billion in financing for Redwood Materials’ battery component recycling and production facility in Nevada.
“Mr. President, I respectfully urge you to reconsider and remove the tariffs on lithium,” Lombardo wrote. “Given that domestic processing is not yet a viable option, the current environment poses a serious risk to jobs in Nevada and across the country.”
Lombardo joins the ranks of several Republican officeholders in the nation who have critiqued the benefits of Trump’s tariff policies, which have continued to hammer stock markets even after Trump pulled back from most of his “Liberation Day” tariffs on nations the world over.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lombardo-bendnarksi-close-crop.jpg,,,2025-04-17 19:06:55.076903

Contributed/Altamaha RiverkeeperClean energy advocates say that a new exemption granted by the Trump administration for dozens of power plants – including two in Georgia – is the latest example of federal policy favoring the coal industry despite pollution concerns.
Earlier this week, the Environmental Protection Agency approved a two-year exemption allowing Georgia Power’s Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer to bypass federal emission regulations for mercury and other air pollutants.
At the request of Georgia Power’s parent company, Southern Co., the two fossil fuel plants were among the more than 60 power plants granted an exemption. The federal agency said the move would bolster national energy security.
Biden’s EPA issued a rule last year tightening toxic metal emission standards by 67% and reducing mercury emissions standards by 70% from existing coal- and oil-firing power plants. The stricter regulations were set to be enforced in 2027.
“At EPA, we are committed to protecting human health and the environment; we are opposed to shutting down clean, affordable and reliable energy for American families,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.
Georgia Power has cited the cost of environmental compliance in the debate over the continued operation of coal-fired plants and the cleanup of toxic coal ash left behind. The company has come under fire for reversing plans to shutter Bowen and Scherer. The company instead is asking that state regulators sign off on extending the lifeline of the two plants and allow the company to ramp up its fossil fuel energy capacity.
In its 2022 resource plan, the utility said it would retire Bowen and Scherer by 2028. Since then, Georgia Power has cited a projected industrial growth boom primarily driven by massive data centers as a reason it is now planning to retire Bowen by 2035, and Scherer Unit 3 by 2038.
Isabella Ariza, a senior attorney for the Georgia chapter of the Sierra Club, said the Trump administration’s action will undermine a rule designed to limit dangerous toxins.
“It’s definitely making it hard for environmental interveners in the Georgia Power (Integrated Resource Plan) and subsequent rate case this year to make a case that Georgia Power should get rid of aging and expensive coal,” Ariza said.





State regulators began holding hearings on Georgia Power’s long-term resource plans in March. Those hearings are set to continue in late May. 





“We’re hoping that (water pollutant guidelines), coal combustion residuals and other policies remain in place,” she said. “That’s the only way we have to protect the people that live near these plants even if companies like Georgia Power decide to keep burning coal.”
Southern Co. said in a statement that it remains in compliance with the federal guidelines for Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which cover air emission limits for coal- and oil-fired power plants.
“Extending the current deadline will provide additional time needed both to address potential rule changes and further demonstrate compliance to the current requirements,” the company statement said.
Keri Powell, a senior attorney in the Southern Environmental Law Center’s Georgia office and air program leader, said this exemption allows polluters to place communities in Bartow and Monroe counties at risk by spewing more toxic chemicals into the air.
“Residents in and around Bartow and Monroe counties should be concerned that this reckless attempt to exempt utilities from these rules will expose them to more toxic chemicals and health risks,” Powell said in a statement. “This attempt is a slap in the face to Georgians who face disproportionate harm from the dirty fossil fuel industry.”
Ariza said there is some optimism that the economics for renewable energy will continue to improve enough to support utility companies increasing their capacity as an alternative to coal.

She was supported by her friend and another former detention employee Shari Rich. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)LEAVENWORTH — Around the corner from a defunct for-profit prison owned by Tennessee-based CoreCivic, Marcia Levering walked carefully across a grassy field to a podium at Ray Miller Park, aided by her cane and a friend, to speak out against the company’s desire to open an ICE detention facility.
Levering, who now lives in Nebraska, worked at the CoreCivic’s Leavenworth Detention Center for 10 months beginning in 2020 before she was stabbed four times by an inmate — once in the ear, once in the right arm, and twice in the abdomen. She shared her experience at a Thursday press conference hosted by ACLU Kansas, Cross-Border Network for Justice & Solidarity and Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation, speaking out against CoreCivic’s desire to reopen the prison and house immigrants.
“As usual, we were understaffed,” Levering said of the attack. “There are two officers in Q building, when there should have been seven. I was in training for a new position. The day of my assault, on Feb. 6, 2021, I was coming out of my office. Unit Four accidentally buzzed open the wrong door, allowing an inmate to come out, throwing boiling water in my face and stab me four times.”
Levering said corrections officers expect to be in danger, but a pattern of understaffing and poor working conditions made the job much more dangerous than it should have been.
The CoreCivic facility closed  in 2021 when its contract with the United States Marshal’s Service ended. Reports by oversight agencies when the Leavenworth facility closed highlighted problems at the facility, including understaffing and the use of “triple bunking” in cells, a practice of adding a third bunk to a cell designed for two inmates.
Leavenworth citizens and others from across the state have stepped forward to protest CoreCivic’s plant to reopen, speaking out through public rallies and at city meetings. City officials heard and responded. The most recent step in disagreements between the city and CoreCivic officials was a lawsuit filed March 31. The city said the company had not followed a proper permitting process to reopen.

Staffing shortages critical
Shari Rich, who worked at the CoreCivic facility for 13 years, attended Thursday to put her voice to those urging the city of Leavenworth to keep the detention center closed. Her first years with the company were good, and she considered the facility well run.
But in the last six years, it steadily deteriorated, she said.
“I worked control,” she said, explaining that was the eyes and ears of the building, keeping oversight of what was happening. “And usually we had two to three officers up there at all times. At the end, when she (Levering) got hurt, there was only one person manning that whole place. There are 24 pods.”
Using her hands, Rich counted how many doors and gates that was for one person to watch, a total that came to more than 45.
“So one person was manning that whole place,” Rich said.
“This was inevitable,” Levering interjected about the attack that left her partially paralyzed and for which she underwent 16 surgeries. “A matter of when.”
 
In the public eye 
Esmie Tseng, spokeswoman for ACLU of Kansas, said the Thursday press conference was a way to keep the issue in front of the Leavenworth community. Although organizations put the event together, she said it’s important that the city be the focus.
“I definitely want it to be more of a bridge for the folks that have these stories to tell, who know firsthand the impact that the facility had on them,” she said. “I think we need to keep remembering that there are people who are at the heart of this.”
Tseng said the city’s officials have stepped up for those who shared their disagreement with CoreCivic reopening.
“It sort of took on its own momentum, right?” she said. “I think it’s such an issue that, like, really spoke to people. I really want to make sure that CoreCivic doesn’t just get to dominate the conversation.”
CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin disagreed, calling the facility’s opponents “politically extreme, out-of-touch, outsider groups that want to tell the people of Leavenworth what to do.”
“The fact is the Leavenworth community wants our facility, the 300 jobs it will create, and the $2 million in annual local revenue it will generate,” Gustin said. “It’s time for the city commission to reject outside groups from hijacking this issue for their own political gain at the expense of the Leavenworth economy. Elected leaders should tell these outside groups to stop sending the message that the public safety profession is not welcome in Leavenworth.
“CoreCivic will operate a safe, transparent, and accountable facility that will be positive for the community,” he said.

Becoming an advocate
William Rogers, another former employee of CoreCivic, has become a grassroots advocate, filling out Kansas Open Records Requests and tracking down building permits and emails as he fights to stop the company from reopening a facility.
When speaking about holding an inmate, Dillon Reed, as he died, Rogers’ voice broke and he struggled to go on.
“I still see Dillon Reed at night sometimes when I go to bed,” Rogers said. “He was a good kid. He should have never died in there. He died because of staff negligence. People are humans in there. They’re inmates, but they’re humans. I think every one of us need to understand that these people have families. They have people that love them. We had a job to do, and we failed that day.”
Rogers received pointed out that CoreCivic promised in emails, which he provided to Kansas Reflector, to use local contractors to do all the upgrades the facility. But when he got a copy of a building permit for the complete removal and replacement of the roof, the contractor was a Texas company, Bass Roofing and Restoration LLC.
CoreCivic also offered, in emails from CoreCivic’s John Malloy:

“A one-time impact fee payment of $1,000,000
An annual impact fee payment of $250,000
An annual impact fee to the police department of $150,000″

The company also said it expects to employ 300 to 350 full-time employees with a total salary and benefit package between $25 million and $30.2 million per year.
 
Prioritizing ‘progress over people’ 
Sister Jean Panisko, with the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth, was the opening speaker Thursday.
“We’re Catholic women, religious, devoted to the work of justice, peace and upholding the integrity of creation,” she said. “We applaud the city commissioners for their actions, for listening to our community and protecting the city by suing CoreCivic, asking them to apply for a special-use permit with money provided by our government.”
Panisko said CoreCivic is promising conditions won’t be the same, but she said the facility “wasn’t closed by chance.”
“It was shut down by the previous presidential administration after serious reports and ultimately finding mismanagement, abuse conditions,” she said. “The closure was and continues to be an indictment of a failed system, one that prioritizes progress over people,  efficiency over empathy and contracts over projects.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levering-and-Rich-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 19:06:55.076903

Free.,Appeals court hears arguments on Trump restricting AP from White House spaces,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-court-hears-arguments-trump-restricting-ap-white-house-spaces,,"WASHINGTON — The Associated Press and the Trump administration faced tough questioning in court Thursday as the White House fights to block a lower court order mandating officials stop denying the wire outlet entry to spaces where other journalists are permitted.A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia grilled the parties at length on how the First Amendment applies to journalists in the Oval Office and other areas, and whether the president can decide which journalists follow him in the press pool and exclude others based on their viewpoint.The case, playing out at the district court level as well, tests decades of established press access for the AP in the White House, which was curtailed after President Donald Trump declared the term “Gulf of America” should be used rather than “Gulf of Mexico.”District Judge Trevor McFadden sided with the AP on April 8 on the grounds that the Trump administration violated the wire service’s First Amendment rights when it publicly retaliated against the agency for an editorial decision to continue using “Gulf of Mexico” in its reporting and influential stylebook.Oval Office not for ‘silent retreat’Before the appeals court Thursday, Eric D. McArthur, representing the government, argued against McFadden’s “unprecedented” preliminary injunction, saying it interferes with the president’s “autonomy” in “highly restricted spaces.”Pointing out the AP was not demanding access “when the president wants to concentrate on his writing and his work,” Judge Corenlia Pillard said “it’s a little confusing to me when you say a place of ‘autonomy.’”“You make the Oval sound like a place of silent retreat,” said Pillard, who was appointed to the appeals bench during President Barack Obama’s second term.Pillard also highlighted the expectation of privacy is different for people in “high public office.”“There’s already a dozen people in there, so he’s agreed to have a press pool,” she said during McArthur’s roughly 45-minute questioning.The administration argued in its emergency appeal to block the ruling that Trump will be “irreparably injured” if the higher court doesn’t stay the lower court order while it adjudicates the case.Officials also countered that the First Amendment protects the president’s right to choose which journalists enter the Oval Office, Air Force One or Mar-a-Lago based on the content of their coverage.Where’s the distinction?Charles Tobin, attorney for the AP, argued that the White House has “brazenly excluded” AP reporters and photographers from opportunities open to other journalists.McFadden “appropriately and very narrowly tailored” his injunction, Tobin said. The lower judge ruled that, under the First Amendment, once the White House opens doors for all journalists to spaces including the Oval Office and East Room, it cannot then exclude them based on viewpoint.McFadden explicitly wrote his ruling does not mandate journalists be given access to the president or that the president cannot choose which outlets to grant exclusive interviews.Judge Neomi Rao said, “the AP concedes he could choose journalists based on viewpoint for exclusive interviews.”“When you’re talking about 10 or 12 journalists in the Oval or on his plane or in his home at Mar-a-Lago, what is the distinction?” asked Rao, who was appointed during Trump’s first presidency.Tobin replied that the pool is a system that invites numerous journalists to participate on a rotating basis.“That’s exactly where the distinction lies,” he said.Private invitations allowableJudge Gregory Katsas presented other scenarios when the president could invite only “supportive” members of the public and press, for example in the Cabinet room for a policy rollout.Tobin argued if the event is open to all press members, the president cannot discriminate based on viewpoint.“Once you have a system of rotation, that’s when the viewpoint becomes anathema,” Tobin replied.What if the president “tapped (certain reporters) on the shoulder” and invited only them into the Oval Office, asked Katsas, who was appointed during Trump’s first term.Tobin replied the president could handpick reporters for a private interview in the Oval Office, as long as it wasn’t an event open to the wider press pool.“This seems awfully close to what’s happening here,” Katsas said.Wire position axedOn Wednesday the White House announced a new media policy placing restrictions on all wire services’ access to the Oval Office and other spaces. Other wire services include Bloomberg and AFP.Despite McFadden’s court order, the White House on Monday denied entry to an AP reporter and photographer to an Oval Office press conference between Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.The AP filed a motion in district court Wednesday requesting McFadden to enforce his preliminary injunction.McFadden has scheduled a hearing for Friday.The White House began denying the AP entry to the Oval Office, East Room and other places on Feb. 11.Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, announced in late February that White House officials would take over pool rotation decisions from the White House Correspondents Association, a member organization that has self-governed journalist rotations and briefing seats placement since the Eisenhower administration.",,,,2025-04-17 19:06:55.076903

(Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma teenager who was arrested in connection with an Election Day terror plot has pleaded guilty, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced Thursday.
Abdullah Haji Zada, 18, a U.S. lawful permanent resident, has pleaded guilty to knowingly receiving, attempting to receive and conspiring to receive a firearm and ammunition to be used to commit terrorism, prosecutors with the Western District of Oklahoma said in a press release.
Prosecutors said Zada, who was 17 when he was arrested in October, pleaded guilty as an adult and faces up to 15 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and deportation to Afghanistan upon his release.
Prosecutors allege Zada and a co-conspirator, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, of Oklahoma City, obtained AK-47 assault rifles and ammunition and conspired to provide support to ISIS to conduct a November 2024 Election Day attack.
Federal investigators have said Tawhedi, who is also an Afghan citizen, allegedly admitted that he planned to target large gatherings of people and said the two expected “to be martyred.” Tawhedi had also taken steps to liquidate his family’s assets and resettle his relatives overseas, officials said.
The criminal complaint alleged the two men advertised the sale of personal property on Facebook. A confidential source asked if a computer was still for sale, which ultimately led Tawhedi and Zada to meet with the buyer at a rural location to test firearms.
The two met with an FBI asset at a rural property and bought and received two AK-47 assault rifles, 10 magazines and 500 rounds of ammunition, according to the criminal complaint.
Authorities then arrested the two.
Authorities said Tawhedi has been charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS, which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and receiving a firearm to commit a felony or federal crime of terrorism. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the latter offense. 
Prosecutors said Tawhedi awaited trial on those charges Thursday.

(Photo by Erik Gunn /Wisconsin Examiner)The economic uncertainty that has sent the stock market and consumer confidence plummeting in the last month hasn’t yet affected employment in Wisconsin, according to the state’s chief economist.
Wisconsin’s job numbers reached another record high in March, and unemployment, although up slightly, is still close to an all-time low, the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) reported Thursday.
Uncertainty over the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration has contributed to falling consumer confidence as well as business confidence, said Dennis Winters, DWD’s chief economist. So far that hasn’t affected the state’s job market, however, he said.
Based on a monthly federal survey of employers, DWD projected Wisconsin had 3.055 million nonfarm jobs in March — an increase of 10,000 from February and 15,000 from a year ago.
From a separate household survey, the department projected Wisconsin’s March unemployment rate at 3.2%. That’s even with February, but a slight increase from the 2.9% calculated for March of 2024.
The job growth was greatest in service industries, which added more than 21,000 jobs over the last 12 months.
Manufacturing jobs have fallen by 7,000 since March 2024 — all of that in durable goods. Winters said that reflects longstanding challenges in the sector more than specific recent developments.

Cox also said he’s instructed state agencies to prepare for possible budget cuts if a recession hits the U.S. 
“We’re always planning for the worst. That’s part of what we do every year, and we’re one of the few states that does that,” Cox told reporters during his monthly PBS Utah news conference on Thursday. “But look, I look at the data just like everyone else, and the possibility of a recession has gone up significantly. Certainly the trade wars have played a role in that.” 
Regardless of “whether you think trade wars are good or bad or will lead to something better, everybody agrees that it’s going to cause pain in the short term.” 
“And we have to be ready for that,” he said.

During a separate news conference earlier this week, on Tuesday, when he and Republican legislative leaders celebrated Utah’s 18th year being ranked No. 1 in the nation for best economic outlook, Cox said he had “instructed all of my department heads to come up with recession plans, looking at three different levels of cuts … if there is a recession.” 
Cox said Thursday that state leaders “will be very cautious in our spending” heading into July 1, when the state’s fiscal year starts, and “we’ll adjust accordingly.” 
For 18th year, Utah ranks No. 1 for best economic outlook. What could threaten its top spot?

The Utah Legislature is already expected to convene in a special session in May to tackle issues the governor outlined in a veto letter he issued March 27, to make changes to at least two bills — HB263, a bill dealing with election transparency and HB356, a bill requiring some counties to elect district-based council members. During that special session, he also said he wants the Legislature to repurpose $3.5 million it had set aside as part of Utah’s bid to keep the Sundance Film Festival, which opted instead to move to Colorado.
It’s possible, depending on national developments and impacts to the economy, that state leaders could also consider budget changes during a special session, but that remains to be seen. 
Pressed on how state leaders will ensure “equity” among state agencies if there are budget cuts so that some services, like social services, aren’t overly impacted, Cox said “the Legislature ultimately controls the purse,” but he also added “we would be equitable in those types of cuts.” 
Cox also said Utah leaders did something similar during the Great Recession. 
“We took some across-the-board cuts, but then we let the experts who run those departments figure out how to implement those,” he said. “Because in recessionary times, there are some places where you would want to increase the budget and others where you would want to decrease it more.” 
He presented a hypothetical scenario of a 3% cut. “It doesn’t mean you cut 3% from every program, but every department would have to find those 3% cuts in their own ways that make sense and continue to serve the people in the state,” he said. 



Tariffs’ impact to Utah businesses, Canada
Cox — who went on a trade mission to Canada last week — said he’s “concerned about the small businesses that are going to be impacted by this.” 
However, he also said he’s “hopeful” that leaders on both sides can “figure out” solutions. 
Excluding gold exported to the United Kington for refinement, Canada, Mexico and China are among Utah’s top trade partners. 
Utah exported $1.3 billion and imported $4.9 billion in goods from Mexico in 2023, according to a recent report from the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. Canada is the second biggest source of Utah’s imports, with $3.1 billion in imports and $1.7 billion in exports that year. China ranks No. 3, with Utah taking in $2.7 million in imports from the country and exporting $1.2 billion. 
Two industries Cox discussed Thursday as being impacted included manufacturing and housing. On the latter, he said he’s “always concerned about the price of housing and what that means for our state and our country.” 
He said World Trade Center Utah and the Governor’s Office of Economic Development are staying in touch with Utah manufacturing companies and “helping them find new suppliers and better, cheaper ways to make their product.” 
Utah GOP leaders defend Trump’s tariffs while bracing for economic ‘turbulence’

“We’ve had some incentives in the past and we’ll be increasing those to move manufacturing here, which is why we led the nation in manufacturing (job growth) last year,” he said. 
Most of all, Cox said he hopes national leaders will at some point soon provide more stability and certainty when it comes to tariffs. He said he’s “supportive of getting pieces of this right, and so I’m grateful that we have an administration that’s willing to look at this.”
“I’m hopeful for more certainty,” he said. “Businesses can be resilient. Capital is a coward, for sure, but once you know the rules, business and entrepreneurs will figure out a way to work around whatever those parameters are. It’s harder when you don’t know what the rules are going forward … so more than anything, we just need to get this nailed down as soon as possible.”
On his conversations with Canadian leaders during his trade mission last week, Cox said, “our Canadian counterparts absolutely agreed that we should be pushing back on China and some of their unfair practices and some of their own tariffs and other issues.” 
But “that being said,” Cox said, “there are still a lot of companies that manufacture out of China, especially smaller companies in Utah who are going to be hit the hardest.” 
“There are lots of companies that are just going to be hurt, there’s not much we can do about it other than trying to help them,” he said. 
Pressed on Canada leaders’ message to him about tariffs, Cox said “their message is exactly what you would expect and what you’ve heard from the premiers there and from the Prime Minister.”
“You know, they felt really disheartened, I guess would be one way to say it,” he said. “Some used the word, kind of, betrayed, that they’re our closest ally and friend. … And yet, there was also a recognition by many of them that they needed to make some changes in Canada as well, which I think is helpful.”
Cox added that Canada “has had very high tariffs on several of their products,” including dairy and lumber, and also has “trade barriers” between its own provinces. He said they also recognized “they needed to invest more in their security and defense as well.”
“So it was interesting to hear this, this recognition that they did need to make some changes, and were willing to do that,” he said. “But yeah, obviously they were very hurt. We’re their overwhelmingly large trading partner, and they’re going to try to diversify more of their trade with other places, but we want to continue that partnership.”

Kelly Armstrong has signed a bill that forbids state wildlife managers from restricting the use of bait for hunting deer on private property. 
Senate Bill 2137 prevents the North Dakota Game and Fish Department from banning deer hunting over bait. The agency has imposed baiting bans in some areas of the state as it tries to prevent the spread of chronic wasting disease, which can be fatal in deer. 
“We can deal with wildlife management and respect private property rights,” Armstrong, who is a hunter, said in a statement. 
Many hunters testified in favor of the bill sponsored by Sen. Keith Boehm, R-Mandan, though some joined the Game and Fish Department in opposing it. 
Other outdoors related bills signed this week include House Bill 1470 that raises the price of hunting, fishing and boating licenses, Senate Bill 2216 that creates a $5 waterfowl hunting stamp to pay for habitat improvement and Senate Bill 2245 that changes rules on hunting waterfowl from a boat.

The university is suing the Federal Emergency Management Agency over what it says are unnecessary hurdles to wildfire compensation. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)A public university in Las Vegas, New Mexico is suing the Federal Emergency Management Agency, alleging the agency is illegally forcing it to jump through bureaucratic hoops before it can seek compensation for a wildfire in 2022 caused by the United States Forest Service.
New Mexico Highlands University, which has about 2,800 students, is seeking compensation from a $5.45 billion fund Congress created to fully compensate victims of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, the biggest fire in New Mexico history, which started due to two botched prescribed burns on federal land in early 2022. 
The wildfire burned more than 530 square miles and destroyed several hundred homes. It also upended life at the university, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday. The lawsuit does not provide a dollar figure, but it lists a variety of losses, including structural damage to university property from flooding and erosion; forced closures; increased insurance premiums; as well as emergency staffing costs for student support and operational expenses. 
Hermits Peak Fire victims say claims office head offered reassurances about Trump’s threatened cuts 

But rather than applying for compensation made available through the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act, the university’s lawsuit says it is being required to first exhaust another means of covering some of those costs known as the FEMA Public Assistance program. 
That program is reserved for public entities like local governments and school districts seeking reimbursement for emergency and infrastructure costs they suffered during a disaster. 
It is also notoriously slow, requiring a seven-step approval process. 
“The Public Assistance program is a lengthy discretionary reimbursement program, not a compensation program, that is difficult to navigate, can take years to complete, and will not cover all of Plaintiff’s damages,” writes Brian Colón, a former state auditor and lawyer with Singleton Schreiber, which is suing on NMHU’s behalf. 
The City of New Orleans is still awaiting some Public Assistance funds from Hurricane Katrina funds in 2005, according to the lawsuit. Here in New Mexico, six bridges damaged in a 2008 flood in Ruidoso were still awaiting repairs by the time post-fire flooding occurred there last year, delays local officials attribute, in part, to Public Assistance challenges.
Flash floods poised to continue in disaster areas through monsoon season

And the state of New Mexico has awarded $170 million in zero-interest loans in recent years to local governments affected by various recent disasters, a measure meant to counteract delays associated with the FEMA program. 
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, approval for Public Assistance has also become less certain. This week, FEMA declined to cover 100% of the Public Assistance costs incurred from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and denied the state of Washington’s request for disaster assistance, including Public Assistance, following a bomb cyclone there last year.
Colón, in a brief interview Thursday, said he was unaware of any additional delays or denials for public entities affected by the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire since Trump took office. FEMA officials did not immediately respond to a comment about that or the lawsuit generally on Thursday.
The university is not the first public entity in and around the burn scar to sue FEMA for requiring the extra step. Other plaintiffs include the Mora-San Miguel Electrical Co-operative, Las Vegas City Schools, and the Mora Independent School District. Those cases are all still pending. 
As of April 15, the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Claims Office has paid out $2.25 billion in compensation to individuals, businesses, nonprofits and local governments, which amounts to about 41% of the $5.45 billion Congress awarded. That figure includes $137 million to local governments, most of which was a single payment of $98 million to the City of Las Vegas to replace its water treatment facilities.
The amount paid out via FEMA Public Assistance money is less clear. According to a FEMA website, the agency has obligated a little more than $170 million to local public entities that incurred costs related to the wildfire disaster in New Mexico in 2022. That money goes to public entities in the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burn scar but also other wildfires that erupted in the state in spring 2022, and it’s not clear how much has been actually paid, not just obligated, so far.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_9288-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

According to state records, Jordan Nuno was employed by the Eighth Judicial District Department of Corrections as a full-time residential officer at the state-run Ottumwa Residential Facility from 2019 until January 2025, when he was fired.
The Ottumwa facility houses criminal offenders who have been ordered by the court to reside there as a condition of probation or parole. Nuno was tasked with supervising residents, taking periodic resident counts, and addressing any resident conduct issues.
According to the department, the final incident that triggered Nuno’s firing occurred on Dec. 18, 2024, as Nuno was making his rounds in a hallway at the Ottumwa Residential Facility. Based on video surveillance and witness statements, the department alleged that Nuno knowingly and intentionally shoulder-checked a resident of the facility, Jaden Miller, in an overt, unprovoked act of aggression.
Then, as Nuno continued down the hallway, Nuno allegedly directed a racial slur at resident Derek Winston, who is African American, and threatened to assault Winston and have him sanctioned or given jail time.
Nuno, the department alleged, then shoulder-checked Winston in another overt and unprovoked act of aggression, then shoved Winston against the wall.
According to the department, neither resident responded with violence. Immediately after the incident with Winston, Nuno allegedly informed a supervisor he had used force against a resident, and later told Resident Manager Charles Severs he was willing to “take a suspension” for doing so.
Later, when questioned by his superiors about shoulder-checking Miller, Nuno allegedly compared the residential facility to a prison and stated that Miller should have stepped aside as Nuno proceeded down the hallway. The department subsequently fired Nuno.
After he applied for unemployment benefits, Nuno participated in a fact-finding interview with Iowa Workforce Development and, according to an IWD administrative law judge, he “willfully misrepresented” the facts surrounding his dismissal.
“Essentially everything Mr. Nuno (said) was an intentionally false statement,” Administrative Law Judge James Timberland ruled. “Mr. Nuno asserted a resident suddenly approached him, called him a racial slur, and hit him,” and also asserted he was discharged because his manager is a racist, Timberland stated.
Based on the statements he had made to the IWD fact-finder in January, Nuno was awarded unemployment, and he subsequently collected $8,084 in benefits over a 12-week period.
After finding that Nuno misrepresented the facts related to his firing, Timberland recently ruled Nuno had “assaulted” residents of the Ottumwa facility and was ineligible for unemployment benefits. Nuno was ordered to repay the $8,084 in benefits already collected.
Court records show Nuno is currently facing a criminal charge of cruel treatment of a prisoner, a serious misdemeanor, as well as a simple-misdemeanor charge of assault. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and informed the court he intends to mount an affirmative defense of justification and self-defense. A jury trial on the cruel-treatment charge is scheduled for June 23, 2025.



Police officer, school teacher fired from their jobs
Other Iowans whose unemployment cases recently went before an administrative law judge include:
— Leon Spataru, who was fired from the City of Eldridge Police Department in January after the city concluded he was unfit for duty. According to the city, Spataru began working for the department in April 2024 as a full-time police officer.
In August, October and December of 2024 he allegedly told a supervisor he was anxious, fearing for his and his family’s safety, and was stressed to the point of feeling sick. An independent, third-party medical provider later conducted a psychological evaluation and concluded that Spataru was unable to consistently perform the essential functions of the job — after which the city fired him and challenged his application for unemployment benefits.
Administrative Law Judge Daniel Zeno ruled recently that Spataru is eligible for benefits since he had not committed workplace misconduct. “Failure in job performance due to inability or incapacity is not considered misconduct” because such actions are not voluntary, Zeno stated in his ruling.
— Joseph Vannatta, who worked as a high school band instructor for the Cherokee Community School District until he was fired in the spring of 2024. Police had alleged Vannatta “inserted himself in Snapchats” with a student and “continued to get personal” by engaging the student in explicit discussions of sex.
In July 2024, Vannatta pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment. Administrative Law Judge Sean Nelson subsequently found Vannatta was entitled to unemployment benefits, finding the school district had not “met its burden to describe the specific incidents that allegedly violated (state law)” or proven that Vannatta “used his authority to sexually exploit” a student.
The school district appealed that ruling and the state’s Employment Appeal Board recently reversed Nelson’s decision, stating that Vannatta “was charged with a crime and pled to an indictable offense factually related to that crime.” Because an aggravated misdemeanor, such as harassment, constitutes “gross misconduct,” the board ruled, Vannatta is ineligible for unemployment.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unemployment-benefits-form-with-rejected-stamp.jpg,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

(Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Fourth-generation Middle Tennessee cattle farmer Cole Liggett lined up with scientists and environmental advocates in March to urge Tennessee lawmakers not to gut the state’s historically strong protections for wetlands.
Wetlands protection has been good business for Liggett. In addition to raising cattle, he’s a manager at Headwaters Reserve, a firm that developers pay to preserve and restore wetlands and streams so they can destroy them elsewhere, called mitigation banking. If lawmakers follow through on a plan to deregulate an estimated 80% of the state’s isolated wetlands, that will upend the industry in Tennessee and drive up prices for developers still required to pay for mitigation, Liggett testified.
Liggett works in a growing industry that operates more than 2,500 mitigation banks nationwide, earning an estimated $3.5 billion in revenue in 2019, according to a 2023 study funded by the Ecological Restoration Business Association. 
The industry is built on demand spurred by the 1972 U.S. Clean Water Act, which requires developers to offset their damage to wetlands by building or restoring wetlands nearby.
But recent federal actions to shrink the scope of that law are pushing states to choose how strictly they will regulate wetlands. The consequences of those decisions not only threaten further degradation of land, water and wildlife, but also the fortunes of an industry that has made a big business out of conservation.

The 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Sackett v. EPA stripped federal protection from wetlands that don’t have a surface connection to navigable waters, which means bigger rivers and lakes. President Donald Trump’s administration has vowed to ease regulation, allowing developers to ditch and drain all but the wettest wetlands without permits or mitigation. Environmentalists fear that a recent order to speed up around 600 energy projects nationwide could limit requirements to compensate for the destruction of wetlands.
Some states, such as North Carolina and Indiana, have loosened regulations since the Sackett decision. In March, Kentucky lawmakers passed legislation to do the same, overriding Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto.
Tennessee’s wetlands regulations predate the federal Clean Water Act protections passed in the 1970s, but pending legislation could roll back much of that protection, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center.
The Tennessee Ecological Restoration Association, which represents Liggett and other mitigation bankers in Tennessee and the southeast, told the Tennessee Lookout that this will directly impact the growing mitigation industry. “We will see a decrease in demand for credits if aquatic resources are deregulated.”
Those concerns aren’t shared by everyone in mitigation banking. The national industry is more worried about the defunding of agencies that oversee banks and the prospect of a recession.

William Coleman’s California-based ecological consulting firm Eco-Asset Solutions and Innovations does much of its business in states that have active wetlands mitigation banking programs.
“My company has not seen any downturn in business,” Coleman, the firm’s founder and president, said. ‘Landowners are still very interested in the revenue opportunities mitigation banking offers.”
Protection limits risk industry investments
Just outside of Memphis, a chorus of frogs on a roughly 250-acre tract of former farmland nearly drowns out the traffic on nearby Austin Peay Highway. Environmental consulting firm EnSafe planted about 54,000 trees on the once flood-prone fields in 2018 and will be responsible for its upkeep until the wetland is mature and healthy – anywhere from seven to 10 years. After that, the land will go to a partnering land trust, where it will be conserved in perpetuity.
“Granted, there is a business piece to what we do, but restoring things to the way they were is also pretty cool … There will be a pocket here forever,” EnSafe principal Paul Stoddard said.
The West Tennessee Wetlands Mitigation Bank has sold credits to Amazon to offset a new delivery center in Fayette County. A contractor purchased credits to compensate for a 2-million-square-foot distribution facility called “Project Iron Giant,” according to records kept by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, one of the federal agencies tasked with overseeing wetlands regulations.
TERA estimates that mitigation businesses have poured more than $1 billion into around 130 mitigation bank investments across Tennessee.
“The beauty of mitigation credits is that the developer just writes a check and they’re done. All the monitoring and reporting and maintenance and stuff is up to the bank,” EnSafe Senior Ecologist Jimmy Groton said.
That process makes mitigation banking a high-risk industry, according to Liggett. Regardless of whether they sell credits, banks are required to maintain their wetlands for at least seven years. The proposed regulatory rollback on Tennessee’s wetlands would mean an 80% decrease in demand for mitigation businesses, he testified to Tennessee lawmakers on March 26.
“Such a drastic decrease in the demand after such a high investment … has potential to drive up credit prices as a necessity to avoid potential financial insolvencies,” Liggett said.
Hillary Bonham, a principal at environmental consulting firm Baetis Restoration Partners, has experience as both a residential developer and mitigation banker. She told Tennessee lawmakers that the current average price of a credit in Tennessee is around $50,000. Reducing regulations and hampering demand will likely cause the credits that remain to be “exponentially more expensive when they are needed.”
In Georgia, where isolated wetlands are not regulated, a single credit can range from $750,000 to $1.1 million according to the Georgia Alabama Land Trust In Lieu Fee Program, Bonham said.

States can protect isolated wetlands
Mitigation banks have been the preferred way to offset wetland destruction for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Corps since 2008, and the industry has ballooned rapidly since the first entrepreneurial banks were established in the early 1990s.
John Paul Woodley, Jr. helped issue the Army Corps of Engineers’ 2008 mitigation rule while serving as assistant secretary of the Army for civil works. He’s also the immediate past chair of the board of the National Environmental Banking Association, a trade association with around 100 members nationwide.
Some people expected to see the Sackett decision have a dramatic impact on mitigation banking, he said, but two limiting factors prevented a panic within the industry.
First, when the decision was made, developers already well into the permit process could either choose to move forward under the previous terms or go back to the drawing board. Most businesses didn’t want to start over, so many pending permits under review by the Corps proceeded as though nothing had happened, Woodley said.
Second, states have significant control over the regulation of state waters.
“Many states have just said, ‘We don’t care about that. We have our own jurisdiction, and we’re not limited by what the Clean Water Act says is the waters of the United States … If the U.S. doesn’t want to protect those waters, that’s fine and dandy. We will,’” Woodley said.
Some states have more isolated wetlands than others, he added, and those states will have to decide whether to protect those resources. Woodley thinks they ultimately will.
Generally, coastal wetlands will maintain federal protection because of their connection to the navigable waters of the ocean. But experts fear that some swamps and marshlands, once protected, may now face development due to human-made flood-control structures, such as levees or berms, that could be construed as legal separations between wetlands and waters of the U.S.
Trump pushes to expedite wetlands permitting
President Trump’s declaration of a “national energy emergency” led the Corps to fast-track review for more than 600 permits. 
Environmental advocates say that could come at the expense of wetlands. 
“Any damages to wetlands due to this emergency must be mitigated properly,” said Matt Rota, senior policy director for Healthy Gulf, a nonprofit advocating for communities along the Gulf Coast. “For every wetland that is destroyed, we must see at least three acres of wetlands being built, which would not happen during an emergency process.”
Those in the industry see other actions by the administration as slowing down environmental permitting, posing a different kind of threat. Trump’s first administration made funding cuts to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Corps that ultimately increased the time it took to review pending permits. Longer review periods can mean less return on investment for landowners, Coleman said.
“That meant there were just not enough bodies to review the applications that were on the table … so there was a tremendous delay,” he said. 
Coleman’s company found that an average two- to three-year review period stretched into four or five years during Trump’s first term. 
Woodley said demand for mitigation banks is driven largely by development pressure. In Virginia, where he’s based, data centers are a big contributor. Some of the mitigation banking industry’s biggest customers are state transportation departments and the oil and gas industry—roadways and pipelines often have less flexibility to build elsewhere.
“Anything that takes place that causes an economic downturn, that causes people to retrench and postpone their development plans … that’s the risk to the mitigation industry,” Woodley said. “They had a very difficult time around 2008 … the number of permits applied for declined, and at the same time, the number of the requirements for mitigation took a downturn.”
In Gulf States like Louisiana, which is home to 40% of wetlands in the continental U.S. and has sustained 80% of national wetland losses, environmental advocates warn about the consequences of filling in wetlands through emergency permitting without ensuring proper mitigation. 
“We have learned the hard way that each acre of wetlands that is destroyed and replaced with concrete worsens our flooding problems and increases our climate risks,” said Kristen Schlemmer, senior legal director of the Bayou City Waterkeeper, a nonprofit working to protect communities impacted by water pollution and flooding in Houston.
Some wetlands mitigation banking businesses have begun to diversify their offerings to include conservation-based credits for protecting the habitats of endangered species, carbon sequestration or nutrient banking to prevent excessive runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus.

(Screenshot via Bismarck Tribune)The North Dakota Supreme Court heard arguments Thursday in a case that could determine whether a state law on underground carbon dioxide storage is constitutional and fair to landowners. 
The Northwest Landowners Association and other landowners are suing the state of North Dakota and the state Industrial Commission over a state law that can force landowners to take part in an underground CO2 storage project. 
Joining the state in defending its statute are Minnkota Power, Basin Electric Power, Dakota Gasification Co. and Summit Carbon Solutions, the Iowa-based company that has a permit to store millions of tons of carbon dioxide in western North Dakota.
Initial fate of property rights lawsuit now in the hands of a judge

The North Dakota Farm Bureau has joined the landowners in their lawsuit. 
Derrick Braaten, representing the landowners, said the state law authorizing amalgamation — forcing landowners to allow carbon dioxide storage beneath their property if 60% of the landowners agree to a storage project — is unconstitutional and doesn’t allow landowners to use the court system to argue for just compensation. 
Northeast Judicial District Judge Anthony Swain Benson dismissed the lawsuit in August, ruling that a law passed in 2009 could not be challenged because a statute of limitations had expired.  Thursday’s arguments delved into the merits of the case. 
Braaten urged the Supreme Court to overrule the district court on the technicalities. He said the Supreme Court could also rule on the merits of the case or send it back to the district court for further arguments. 
The Supreme Court took the case under advisement. 
Judge dismisses landowner lawsuit against state, citing procedural issues

Summit Carbon Solutions is seeking to use property in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties for underground CO2 storage. The underground storage area is referred to as pore space.
Phil Axt, representing the state, noted that North Dakota’s geology is exceptionally well suited to underground carbon dioxide storage. He said the state should have the authority to regulate a shared resource. 
He said the case could set a precedent. 
“As far as we’re aware, no other court has yet addressed the pooling of pore space interests and the interplay between individual rights, majority rights and regulatory authority,” Axt said. “We think courts around the country will be answering them, but this court is positioned to be the first.” 
Paul Forster, attorney for Minnkota Power, argued that allowing a small percentage of landowners to stop an underground storage project denies the majority of a right to profit from their property. 
Braaten also argued that state law takes away the right of landowners to challenge the level of compensation if a landowner is forced into a pool. 
He noted the potential revenue for Summit Carbon Solutions if it is able to take advantage of federal tax credit for storing carbon dioxide, which the company hopes to gather from ethanol plants in five Midwest states. 
“They’re making millions, if not billions, of dollars doing it by collecting government tax credits, and they’re saying we don’t get our share of that, even though it’s our property they’re using,” Braaten said. 
Carbon pipeline company seeks dismissals of North Dakota court challenges

About 92% of landowners in the 90,000-acre sequestration area for Summit were participating voluntarily at the time Summit’s storage permit was approved.
Summit Carbon Solutions, which faces a permitting challenge in South Dakota, did not make oral arguments Thursday. Among the arguments Summit made in a brief filed with the court is that the state has a law that forces property owners to participate in oil and gas development.
Braaten argued those property owners are fairly compensated. 
The Northwest Landowners Association successfully challenged a 2019 North Dakota pore space law at the state Supreme Court, with justices finding it unconstitutional. 
Landowners are also appealing the Industrial Commission’s permit decision for the Summit storage area.

,DC,2025-04-17 21:33:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Van Hollen: El Salvador soldiers blocked wellness check of wrongly deported man,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/van-hollen-el-salvador-soldiers-blocked-wellness-check-wrongly-deported-man,,"U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Thursday that soldiers blocked him from entering a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador where the erroneously deported Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia has been held for more than a month.The Maryland Democrat arrived in the Central American country Wednesday in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia, whom the Justice Department admitted in court was deported in error, back to the United States, or at least check on his wellness. He met with El Salvador Vice President Félix Ulloa that day, who denied his requests to either visit or speak on the phone with Abrego Garcia.Van Hollen told reporters Thursday afternoon that he again tried to make contact with Abrego Garcia that morning.A U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 finding that sending Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen, back to his home country would put him in grave danger.Accompanied by Chris Newman — the lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s wife and his mother — Van Hollen said they tried to enter Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, but soldiers stopped them at a checkpoint about three kilometers from the prison.“We were told by the soldiers that they’d been ordered not to allow us to proceed any further than that point,” Van Hollen said.Van Hollen said that since Abrego Garcia was sent to CECOT, he has not spoken with anyone outside of the prison walls, and “this inability to communicate with his lawyers is a violation of international law.”The senator pointed out that El Salvador is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.“That covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,’” he said.Van Hollen also said he met with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and they discussed “the full range of important bilateral relations between the United States and El Salvador.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other Republicans have criticized Van Hollen for making the trip, repeating the accusation that Abrego Garcia is a gang member.Representatives for the White House and DHS did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.Appeals court slams administration’s inactionMeanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s case continues to work its way through U.S. courts as a flashpoint conflict between two branches of government that has led to the precipice of a constitutional crisis.On Thursday, a federal appeals court panel dismantled the administration’s latest appeal, saying the government had done “essentially nothing” to attempt to return Abrego Garcia in compliance with last week’s Supreme Court order.A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said the executive branch was due deference in conducting foreign policy, but that the administration’s inaction in seeking Abrego Garcia’s return amounted to defiance of a judicial order.The unanimous ruling was written by Fourth Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan. The other two judges, Robert Bruce King and Stephanie Thacker, were nominated by Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done,” the panel wrote. “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”The appeals ruling responded to the government’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ order this week for the Trump administration to offer evidence on how it has sought to help with Abrego Garcia’s release from CECOT.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” — but stopped short of requiring — his return to the United States.In unusually frank language, the Fourth Circuit panel warned Thursday the conflict between the executive and judicial branches threatened the foundation of U.S. government.“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” the court asked. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present.”Near the end of the order, the panel urged the administration to obey the judicial branch.“We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos,” the judges wrote. “This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.”Neither country taking actionThe Fourth Circuit panel pointed out that the leaders of both the United States and El Salvador claimed they had no power to return Abrego Garcia.“We are told that neither government has the power to act,” they wrote. “The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.”During a White House visit this week, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he would not bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.The Trump administration has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error.” The administration continues to accuse him of being part of the gang MS-13, despite no charges or convictions of any criminal offenses against him, including gang-related crimes.Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

A Navy veteran who calls Myrtle Beach home is running to be the first Democrat in modern history to win South Carolina’s 7th Congressional District.
John Vincent, who retired in 2003 as command master chief petty officer — one of the Navy’s highest ranks for enlisted sailors — planned Thursday evening to launch his 2026 campaign to represent the state’s Grand Strand and much of the Pee Dee.
“Let’s shock the world. Let’s turn a seat blue,” the 64-year-old told the SC Daily Gazette in an interview ahead of his official announcement. “I know we’re going to win.”
Vincent is the first Democratic challenger to file paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for any of South Carolina’s 2026 congressional races. Three Democrats, as well as one Republican, have done so to oppose longtime U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham.
The 7th District, anchored in fast-growing Horry County, has been represented by GOP Rep. Russell Fry since 2022, when he ousted Republican Tom Rice, who angered Republicans in the ruby red district for voting to impeach President Donald Trump in 2021. Fry’s office did not immediately respond to email and phone messages from the Gazette.
“Congressman Fry is doing an awesome job and the party is proud of all he has been able to accomplish!” Abby Zilch, spokeswoman for the state Republican Party said in response to Fry’s challenger.
Vincent said he recognizes he has an uphill battle in a district dominated by Republicans. A Democrat last held the 7th District in the early 1930s, when it dissolved with the state’s loss of population at the time, and its location in the state was completely different.
The closest a Democrat has gotten to winning the seat since South Carolina gained it back with the 2010 census was in 2012, the first election with the recrafted 7th District. That year, Democrat Gloria Bromell Tinubu received 44% of the vote to Rice.
Fry won re-election in November with 65% of the vote, the most decisive win for the seat this century.
“Our turnout has not been strong. Apathy has been high,” Vincent said of Democrats.
“In order to win, about 15% of people who voted for my opponent are going to have to vote for me,” he added. “Not stay home, but vote for me.”
Vincent pointed out that the Pee Dee region struggles with poverty. Chesterfield, Marlboro, Dillon and Marion counties are among the state’s poorest, according to the most recent numbers from the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
Vincent said he can represent those voters as someone who understands the challenges of day-to-day life.
“I’ve never been rich, and I’ve been lucky to never be poor,” he said.
Vincent says on his campaign website that he’s struggled with alcoholism (he’s more than two decades sober) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
He hopes transparency and a desire to be represented by an “average Joe” will carry him past Fry, who was a state legislator and lawyer before ascending to national politics.
Vincent called his ability to connect with people his “superpower.”
Vincent will hold town halls twice a month until the November 2026 election, he said.
He described himself as an advocate of abortion rights, saying those decisions should be fully up to patients and their doctor.
He also wrote a book with his wife about leadership through diversity and inclusion that draws on lessons from his time in the military. He’s in favor of a pathway to citizenship for immigrants without proper authorization — as long as they don’t have a criminal record. He says gender is each person’s own business.
He also supports a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage. South Carolina doesn’t have a state minimum wage, so the minimum is set by the federal standard, which has been $7.25 an hour since 2009.
Vincent said those views aren’t too liberal for South Carolina, where voters in November gave the Legislature their largest GOP majority since Reconstruction and no Democrat has won any statewide office since 2006. He believes the reason Democrats have failed is because they haven’t focused on the economic issues that matter most to voters.
“That’s why the middle class is going ‘ehhh, I need a job here,’” he said. “It just seems like they don’t really understand what’s going on in our life.”
He then pointed to his campaign slogan: “Warrior-advocate for the middle class and most vulnerable.”
It’s not a cliche; it genuinely represents him, he said.
He carries a concealed weapon and wants to invest in technology to make the border stronger, he told the Gazette. “Core pillars” of his campaign include protecting veterans, as well as federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid that are intended to help the working class cover necessary costs.
While Vincent, who owns a leadership and organizational consulting firm, condemns the aggressive slashing of jobs touted by President Donald Trump and spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, a balanced budget is another “core pillar” of his campaign, he says.
“You do it strategically,” Vincent said. You do it in a “way that’s responsible,” adding that his company helps other businesses operate efficiently.
During his own town hall Wednesday, Fry said he will continue being one of Trump’s biggest allies in congress, The Sun News reported.
“This district is a very conservative district, and that’s what they elected me to do. And he has not wasted any time in getting our country back on track,” the 40-year-old incumbent said.
Fry has $625,000 available in his campaign account, according to his latest Federal Election Commission filings.
Vincent officially filed his campaign paperwork on March 13 and had $7,500 at the end of the month. He said his campaign is up to $30,000 as of Thursday. He estimates he’ll need only $300,000 to win, saying he knows he won’t be able to outspend Fry and doesn’t need to.
“You don’t need a million and a half (dollars),” he said. “If you’re willing to connect with people and you’re willing to tell the truth, even though they may not like it, that’s how you do it.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/John-Vincent_headshot.jpg,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

The gift also endows and renames the Nuremberg to The Hague (N2H) Program in honor of Howard A. Kaiman, a Creighton alumnus.
Samuel and Ida Kaiman, both Omaha natives, were Donna’s parents. Howard, a lifelong Omahan and attorney, was Donna’s brother. Family members said Howard took night law classes at Creighton in the 1960s, during an antisemitic period when Jews were being denied by country clubs and colleges.
Before he died in 2023 at age 93, Howard Kaiman asked his family to distribute his estate to worthy causes.

Donna (Kaiman) Gilbert, in a media statement, said the program funding would help continue the good deeds and community work carried out by her parents and brother. She also said the new center and the N2H program would help keep the memory of the Holocaust alive for new generations. The Nazi regime and their allies killed about 6 million Jewish people in the genocide known as the Holocaust, 1933 to 1945.
“They will challenge them never to forget that this happened and that it can happen again, very easily, if we don’t remember,” said Gilbert.
Michael Kelly, Creighton law professor and director of N2H, said the endowment and center have “forever changed how we teach the Holocaust, genocide and international criminal justice at Creighton.”
Every summer for more than a decade, the N2H program has taken up to 30 students to Germany, the Netherlands and Poland to learn firsthand about the Holocaust. The news release describes the program as an immersion into historical and legal experiences that combine classroom instruction with trips to crime scenes, places of conspiracy and trials for crimes against humanity being litigated today.

The endowment ensures the perpetuity of the N2H program, Creighton officials said, and the new research hub builds upon and broadens its impact and influence.
“The center also provides us the invaluable opportunity to explore more deeply the international atrocities taking place today, and the courts tasked with litigating them,” Kelly said.
He said the center could bring in world-renowned attorneys to speak about genocide litigation, explore cases being tried in the International Criminal Court of Justice and examine the genocide of the Rohingya in Burma, the Kurds in Iraq and other repressed people worldwide.

(Photo courtesy of Mark Gocke)This story was first published by WyoFile on April 10, 2025.
A dismayed Chris Servheen is raising the alarm about what’s become of federal scientists who have kept watch over the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly bear population for the last 55 years.
The group of research biologists and technicians, known as the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, are being hamstrung at best and arguably dismantled, he told WyoFile. For decades, until his retirement in 2016, Sevheen worked closely with the study team while coordinating grizzly bear recovery for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
“It’s functionally destroying the organization,” Servheen said April 3. “The study team has been in place since 1970 — over 50 years of work and experience and knowledge. It’s going to just disappear and die.”

Servheen’s perplexed about what the Trump administration has to gain.
“How could anybody be so negligent and vile that they’re trying to destroy something that has brought grizzly bears back from the edge of extinction?” he said. “Why would you do that? It’s just so destructive.”
Led by Elon Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency’s dismantling started with a hiring freeze. Longtime supervisory wildlife biologist Mark Haroldson retired, and his position is not being filled, according to Servheen. Then, the team’s longtime leader, Frank van Manen, announced an earlier-than-desired retirement.
“He didn’t want to leave,” Servheen said of van Manen, who declined to comment.

According to Servheen, van Manen’s departure was related to the federal government’s ongoing upheaval.
“They’re putting fear into people,” Servheen said. “That’s basically evil, to do that to hard-working people who have been civil servants for decades.”
 What are the responsibilities of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team?

The Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team is part of the U.S. Geological Survey, and its website lists four other employees. Three are technicians, which are often seasonal, entry-level employees. The remaining staff biologist has been in the job about three years.










“They’re putting fear into people. That’s basically evil, to do that to hard-working people who have been civil servants for decades.”

If any of the study team’s employees opt to stick it out amid a second wave of buyouts, they’re likely to be out of an office space come fall. The Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, described by its director as “one of the nation’s key laboratories to study the ecosystems and species of the Northern Rockies,” is one of hundreds of federal facilities being shuttered by DOGE.
Although located in Bozeman, many of the federal facility’s researchers do work in Wyoming.
“They do all kinds of other stuff: brucellosis and chronic wasting disease and aquatic species,” Servheen said. “It’s a huge science center.”
The planned closure has elicited protests. According to Yellowstonian.org, 42 retired or active biologists petitioned Montana’s congressional delegation to use their influence to “protect [the science center] and its employees from these unwarranted attacks by DOGE.”
Federal offices located in Wyoming have not escaped the closures. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s tribal-focused Lander conservation office and a USGS Cheyenne water science station are among those that have been marked for the chopping block.
WyoFile could not officially confirm impacts to the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team. Federal agencies under the Trump administration have declined or not responded to WyoFile’s requests for more information on downsizing and office closures. An inquiry to a USGS public affairs officer on Thursday yielded no information about the matter.
The Center for Biological Diversity has been pressing the federal agency for details as well. On Thursday, the environmental advocacy organization publicized a Freedom of Information Act request to gain more insight into the future of the federal grizzly team.
Both recently departed veteran study team members — van Manen and Haroldson — are staying engaged in grizzly science in pro-bono emeritus roles, according to a source familiar with the situation.

 The foundation of Yellowstone grizzly bear recovery

Nevertheless, Servheen worries that the hit to the science team could trickle down to the grizzly population — estimated at 1,000 or so bears in the Greater Yellowstone — that it’s charged with studying.
Over the decades, federal researchers have played a pivotal role in improving understanding of the region’s bruins, including completing studies that have helped make the case that grizzly bears are fully recovered and no longer require Endangered Species Act protection. They’ve also amassed mortality and other demographic datasets and compiled an annual report.
“The foundation of Yellowstone grizzly bear recovery has been built on science,” Servheen said. “Removing that science eliminates our ability to maintain Yellowstone grizzly bears.”

The leadership award was created in 2015 by ICAN and Kiewit Corp. to recognize leaders who live and lead through collaboration, compassion, confidence and creativity.
Brewer over 28 years has risen from Habitat volunteer to CEO.
“Through her efforts to increase affordable housing and empower families to achieve homeownership, Amanda Brewer is setting the standard for how leaders can ideate, collaborate and break down barriers,” said Aileen Warren, CEO of ICAN.
Brewer’s nomination recognized her collaborative approach. Recent examples cited in a news release include a partnership with Metonic Real Estate Solutions and Apogee Professional Services to create apartments and affordable homes in northwest Omaha that will be in reach of workers. Habitat also hosts clinics on transferring deeds that helped 362 families secure nearly $77 million in generational wealth.
Through a donation from MacKenzie Scott’s Yield Giving fund, Brewer also is helping to establish a coalition among Habitat for Humanity affiliates across the state to address workforce and affordable housing needs.
Habitat Omaha is described as the nation’s top Habitat affiliate based on the number of people it serves. Agency goals include wealth-building, reducing the impact of out-of-state investors who buy properties in Nebraska, payday lending reform and vacant and rental property registration.
Said Brewer: “We know the need for affordable housing is great, and our commitment to making a meaningful impact is stronger than ever.”

Laura Kelly, who signed a bill in May 2022 legalizing sports betting in Kansas, placed the state's first bet in September of that year on the Kansas City Chiefs.(Submitted)TOPEKA — Approval of a last-minute addition to Kansas’ state budget took the gambling and sports betting sphere by surprise, leaving the future of the industry in the state uncertain.
The Kansas Legislature Friday passed the state budget bill, which included a provision that bans the Kansas Lottery, the agency that oversees gambling in the state, from spending state money to negotiate any renewals, extensions or new contracts with sports wagering operators until July 2026.
Jeremy Kudon, a lobbyist who had a hand in ushering in gambling’s new era of sports wagering in the United States, took to the social media platform X to assure bettors that their online sports betting operators would remain in Kansas — for now.
“Just want to clarify: None of the leading OSB operators in Kansas will go dark as a result of today’s vote,” Kudon wrote in a post.
Most contracts with the state lottery are valid until 2027, he said.
“But I wouldn’t let the Kansas legislature off so easy. They had no idea when these contracts expired and were willing to take your favorite OSB apps away from Kansans. We’re not going to let that happen,” Kudon wrote.
Kansans over 21 years old can bet on badminton, bull riding and 50 other categories of live and virtual sports. Since 2022, after the passage of Senate Bill 84, the state recruited six sports wager operators: BetMGM, Caesar’s, DraftKings, ESPNBet, FanDuel and Fanatics. Each of those contracts, which include retail and mobile betting, are set to expire at the same time in August 2027.
Historically, the Kansas Lottery negotiated the contracts and went through an approval process with the Kansas Attorney General’s Office.
The Legislature’s moratorium, which will apply to fiscal years 2025 and 2026, could open up Kansas’ sports betting market to new regulations or more influence from state lawmakers if they decide to take up the issue in the 2026 session. Among possible changes, one option is an increase in the share of money the state collects from sports wagering revenues. The state currently collects 10% of all revenue from both mobile and retail platforms. 
Sports wagering is legal in 39 states and the District of Columbia. Missouri voters narrowly approved in November a constitutional amendment to legalize sports betting online, in casinos and in certain districts near major sports arenas. The rollout was scheduled for this summer, but the state has delayed it until the fall to allow for time to straighten out licensing rules.
Legalized gambling in Kansas dates back to 1986, when more than 60% of voters approved a constitutional amendment to establish a state-run lottery. A year later, the Legislature passed the Kansas Lottery Act. 
The Legislature this year authorized a gaming compact between the governor’s office and the Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska to allow sports betting at the Sac & Fox Casino in Powhattan. In 2024, the Legislature approved a sports betting compact for the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska’s White Cloud Casino in White Cloud and did the same in 2023 for the Prairie Band Casino Resort in Mayetta, which is owned by the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kelly-sports-gambling.png,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

(Getty Images)Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball plans to investigate how the state’s Office of Medical Cannabis (OMC) processed license applications, she announced Thursday. 
Ball’s office will be “examining OMC’s business license application and award processes,” her office said. 
“My office has continued to receive complaints about how the Office of Medical Cannabis administered the lottery process for awarding medical cannabis business licenses,” Ball, a Republican, said in a statement. “Kentuckians should have confidence that state offices operate with transparency and integrity, and my office is committed to ensuring those standards.”
Crystal Staley, a spokeswoman for Beshear, said “no one has filed a legal claim challenging Kentucky’s medical cannabis laws or the Office of Medical Cannabis’ regulations.”
“Throughout the entire process we have been committed to transparency, which is why the lottery process was streamed live and online,” Staley said. “The individuals who have come forward to express ‘concerns’ went through the full process and did not complain until after not being selected in the lottery.” 
In 2023, the legislature legalized medical marijuana for Kentuckians suffering from chronic illnesses. Last year, the bipartisan House Bill 829 became law and moved up the medical cannabis licensing timeline from January 2025 to July 1, 2024. 
During the application period, which was July 1–Aug. 31, the state received 4,998 applications for medical cannabis business licenses, including 918 cultivator and processor applications. 
Patients who qualify for medical cannabis are those with a history of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cancer or other approved medical conditions. 
The Kentucky Lottery Corporation ran the license lottery. 
Beshear said Thursday during his weekly press conference that “more than 12,000 Kentuckians have received a written certification and more than 8,000 have successfully applied for and received a medical cannabis card” since January.

Raj Mukherji intends to crack down on people who threaten judges at a time when judges say attacks on them are growing. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A state senator wants to toughen penalties against people who threaten judges and prosecutors in New Jersey, with attacks on judges escalating as the Trump administration feuds with courts from coast to coast.
Sen. Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson) said he was driven to act after U.S. District Judge Esther Salas revealed recently that judges around the U.S. have received unsolicited pizza deliveries sent in the name of her son Daniel Anderl, who was gunned down in 2020 at the family’s home by an angry litigant.
“These are unprecedented attacks on judicial officers,” Salas told MSNBC in several weekend appearances on the news network.
Under a bill Mukherji plans to introduce, it would become a second-degree crime — with a presumption of incarceration — to threaten, harass, intimidate, or dox local, county, state and federal judges and prosecutors over their work performance.
The offense would be upgraded to a first-degree crime if it occurs at or within 500 feet of the home of a prosecutor, judge, or their immediate family members. That includes sending items or messages to a home protected under Daniel’s Law, which legislators passed after Anderl’s murder to prohibit the disclosure of public officials’ home addresses and phone numbers.
“In a democracy, disagreement is fair game, but intimidation and violence are not. They must be confronted swiftly and without hesitation with the full weight of the law,” Mukherji said in a statement. “Judges and prosecutors must be free to perform their public duties without looking over their shoulders or worrying about the safety of their families. At a time when the independence of the judiciary is under attack and violence is on the rise, we must draw a hard line to protect those who serve justice.”
President Donald Trump, administration officials, and some members of Congress have personally attacked judges they disagree with in recent weeks on social media and in personal appearances.
That has resulted in a sharp uptick in threats to judges, including pizza deliveries to jurists’ homes by people who have “weaponized” Anderl’s name, Salas said. The ominous deliveries send a clear message, she added: “Do you want to end up like Judge Salas? Do you want to end up like her son?”
She urged other states to shield judges’ personally identifiable information, as New Jersey legislators did with Daniel’s Law, and officials at all levels to condemn attacks on the judiciary.
“Whether it be attacks that come in the form of some of our members of Congress calling for our impeachment because we’re doing our jobs, members of this administration calling us rogue, calling us crazy, leftist, unconstitutional judges, or coming in the forms of these acts of intimidation, these are unprecedented times that really call for us to speak up for the judiciary, to speak up for justice,” Salas said.

Bahl has missed 10 days of the legislative session. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers will be paid at least $41,500 for absences during the 2025 legislative session so far, though most legislators with more than a handful of missed days said they were due to family or medical reasons, military service or their jobs.
Rep. Lori VanWinkle, R-Minot, said earlier this week she felt singled out by criticism from the House majority leader over taking five days off to go on a vacation. Five lawmakers have missed six or more days during the legislative session, including VanWinkle, who has missed  seven days of the session.
In total, 84 lawmakers of the Legislature’s combined 141-member body were absent for at least one day since the session began in early January. They accumulated 195 missed legislative days as of Thursday, according to Legislative Council. The North Dakota Monitor excluded from the analysis the absences of Rep. Josh Christy, who died in office in February.
North Dakota lawmaker defends absence as she’s urged to go without pay for vacation

Legislators are paid for days they are absent unless they ask Legislative Council to withhold their pay, said Legislative Council Director John Bjornson. They are paid $213 per calendar day during the legislative session, with committee chairs and other leadership positions earning slightly more. That’s in addition to a monthly salary of $592.
Rep. Landon Bahl, R-Grand Forks, has missed the most with 10 days, according to Legislative Council. Bahl missed the week of March 31 to lobby for fraternities in Washington, D.C., on business not related to the state Legislature, but will receive $1,065 in legislative pay for those five days.
Bahl also has missed days for reasons related to his job. He said his situation is unique because he is the chief operating officer for 322 Hospitality Group, which oversees more than 250 employees across eight different restaurants, hotels and event centers.
“District 17 voted me in as a business operator,” Bahl said. “I always have two laptops because I’m constantly emailing … and bouncing back and forth because that’s my job and this is a part-time citizen Legislature.”

On Monday, House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said he suggested that VanWinkle voluntarily give back the $1,065 in legislative pay she received while on a family vacation. Lefor said he didn’t have the authority to withhold a lawmaker’s pay.
House and Senate rules, however, appear to conflict with state statute. 
North Dakota Century Code states members of the Legislature are “entitled” to receive compensation. 
But House and Senate rules state legislators may not be absent during an entire day “unless unable to attend due to illness or other cause.” The rules also say “no one is entitled to draw pay while absent more than one day without leave.”
Lefor and Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, referred questions on the rules to Bjornson.
Bjornson said he was unsure when the absence rules were first added to the chamber rule books, but they were included in every rule book going as far back as 1957, the oldest rule book on his office shelf.
The presiding officer of the chamber, either the speaker of the House or the president of the Senate, signs payment vouchers for the lawmakers, Bjornson said. If the presiding officer and the majority leader of the chamber told the Legislative Council not to pay someone, they would follow that direction, Bjornson said.
North Dakota lawmakers serve up to 80 days every two years. Thursday was day 64 of the session.
Lefor said earlier this week he thinks it’s inappropriate for a lawmaker to take vacation during a legislative session. VanWinkle defended her absence to spend time with her family and said she thinks the criticism is unfair. She declined additional comment on Wednesday.

Rep. Jayme Davis, D-Rolette, has missed nine days during the legislative session. Absences early in the session were due to the death of her father. More recently, she said she has missed days to drive her mother from Rolette to Bismarck for medical appointments.
“As much as I want a vacation, I’m here to do a job that I was elected to do,” Davis said. “Unless it’s literally life or death, it’s probably the only reason I would miss.”
Rep. Alisa Mitskog, D-Wahpeton, and Rep. Matt Ruby, R-Minot, have each missed six days.
Mitskog said her absences were related to medical reasons for herself and her family. She said her husband is battling cancer that requires appointments in Minneapolis and she attends when possible so she can ask questions. Her elderly mother also needed to be driven to appointments in Fargo that were set up months in advance.
“They weren’t vacation days,” Mitskog said.
Ruby said his absences were due to National Guard training and because his son had surgery. He said he communicated every absence to chamber leadership, which he said is important for planning which bills come to the floor for votes.
“I certainly wasn’t taking vacation,” Ruby said.
Ruby said he does not think the policy surrounding legislative absences needs to be changed because he doesn’t believe people are abusing it, for the most part.
“Sometimes you have doctor’s appointments you have to get done,” Ruby said. “Sometimes you shouldn’t be sitting shoulder to shoulder with someone if you are sick … but it’s expected to be here if you can, and we’re all adults here.”

(Pool photo by Kristen Murphy/Deseret News)After dozens of international students had their visas revoked in Utah, Gov. Spencer Cox asked the Trump administration for more information on the criteria officials are using to select the students who seem to have to suddenly leave the country, some without finishing their programs. 
Since many of the students and universities didn’t receive notices on their status change, Cox also asked the federal government for a “little bit of a heads up when these things are happening,” he said during his monthly news conference broadcast by PBS Utah.

“We’d like to understand better what the criteria are for those changes. Certainly, we know that there were some that had criminal backgrounds that we were not aware of, that the universities were not aware of,” Cox said. “(With) others, that does not appear to be the case, and so we would very much like to figure that out.”
Officers from all public universities in Utah reported over 50 cases of students that had their visas revoked or their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records terminated. Many didn’t release much information to protect the students’ privacy. But, the University of Utah, host of 20 of the impacted students, specified that approximately half of the affected students are from China, a spokesperson said in an email. The other half are from several countries including India and some Middle Eastern countries.
Dozens of international University of Utah students had visas revoked

At Brigham Young University, a private Utah institution, a student from Japan had his visa revoked, potentially for a fishing licensing violation that happened years ago and was dismissed, according to the Deseret News. 
The wave of visa revocations has instilled confusion on campuses throughout the country. 
At the University of Utah “a few university students’ changes in status have not been connected to a clear, specific interaction with law enforcement,” leaders of the institution said in a statement. And none were flagged for participating in protests, a spokesperson said.
There are many unanswered questions still about these cases, but in the meantime, Cox said he hopes the country can keep on attracting talent from abroad, referring to past comments from President Donald Trump on his interest to bring bright minds to American institutions. 
“We know how important those visas are and how important immigrants are to building our economy,” Cox said. 
For the time being the Trump administration hasn’t gotten back to the governor, but, Cox said, there are ongoing conversations on how to keep attracting international students while checking their backgrounds.



Let us know what you think...


 


“It’s important that we vet those who come, that we make sure we understand their backgrounds, that they don’t pose any threats, that they’re supportive of our country and the work that’s being done here,” Cox said. “And then it’s important that we get them and we keep them.”
When asked on whether there’s a constitutional crisis with the Trump administration ignoring orders to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man deported to a prison in El Salvador, even though he was shielded from deportation in 2019, Cox said that this is an interesting constitutional struggle.
“The problem with this is there’s just no nuance in the discussions. It’s like, either you hate the Constitution, or you want terrorists living in America, it seems like those are the two choices,” Cox said.
But, there may be a third option, he added. One in which Abrego Garcia returns to get through the process to get deported again. 
“It really does matter that we hold to these constitutional norms, but pushing the boundaries of those norms is the prerogative, and was intended (…) It’s not the worst thing to challenge those norms, see where the lines are and then work within those lines,” he said.”

Trump and his administration.
Hundreds of protestors at the University of Connecticut and Yale University gathered to oppose what they called an attack on higher education — including recent suspensions of research funding, cancellations of international student visas and what some see as a failure on the part of local officials to respond.
Chants of “Hands off our university!” rung out.

At Yale, roughly 500 faculty, students and community members gathered on the quad known as Cross Campus. Attendees held signs reading “Protect higher ed everywhere” and “Education not deportation.” About 60 miles northeast, more than 200 people at UConn’s Storrs campus participated in a similar effort, part of a national “Day of Action for Higher Ed,” organized locally by chapters of the American Association of University Professors.
According to organizers, the “day of action” included more than 175 gatherings around the country, including at Harvard University which has recently been at the center of standoffs with the Trump administration after threats to end the university’s ability to enroll international students and revoke its tax-exempt status.
“As we see universities across this nation speaking to our shared values, I know more than that ignorance is deadly, but that courage is contagious,” Phillip Atiba Solomon, chair of Yale’s department of African American studies, said while addressing the crowd in New Haven.
In Storrs, Chris Vials, an English professor and union president of UConn-AAUP, said, “We are facing a federal government that wants to do us harm, a federal government that is deporting students from this campus, a federal government that is cutting life saving research, a federal government that hates diversity … and a federal government that’s not even obeying the law.”
The rallies come as details emerge about international students at colleges and universities around the country seeing their visa status terminated by the Trump administration. In Connecticut, more than 50 students have had their visas revoked.
“The truth is students and workers across campus are scared for themselves and their friends, scared to go to class in case they get abducted by ICE, scared to be associated with anything vaguely political, scared to be here today,” said Lily Lou, a UConn political science graduate student. 
“How are any of us expected to learn, teach or work in these conditions?” Lou said.

Student visas
Earlier this week, UConn confirmed that 13 students had their visas revoked, including six undergraduates, six graduate students and one person in a post-graduate professional program. The Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges, which represents 14 higher education institutions, said at least 40 visas had been terminated among students at its member schools — which include Yale University, Trinity College, Quinnipiac University and Wesleyan University.
The revocations are part of a government effort that has left hundreds of students across the country at risk for deportation.

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Thursday he’d sent a letter to the Trump administration demanding details on how many visas had been revoked and guidance on what those students should do next.
“There’s been no due process, no apparent rights of appeal, no disclosure by this administration,” Blumenthal said on Thursday morning during a press conference at New Haven City Hall before heading to UConn to share similar sentiments. “I want the facts and I want the revocations to stop until they come clean with the American people about why these revocations are taking place.”

Later in the day, faculty at Yale described what they see as a “chilling effect” the administration’s actions have had on institutions of higher learning. 
“Who is safe in this environment?” Kishwar Rizvi, a professor at the school of architecture, asked the crowd.
At UConn, Alexander Blagojevic, a biomedical engineering graduate student at UConn, echoed sentiments from Blumenthal and Rizvi. “The brightest minds in the world used to dream about coming here and calling this country home because they knew that this was a place you could come to make a difference,” he said.
“Now, all they dream about is jumping ship.”

Sen. Henri Martin, R-Bristol, ranking member of the Connecticut legislature’s Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee, said Blumenthal “is seeking more information from DHS and the State Department about the revocations. He is right to pursue that clarity and get the facts in order to ensure fairness in the process, as our colleges continue to monitor the situation and provide guidance for students.”
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, and Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said in a joint statement that they “stand with the UConn and Yale communities and share their outrage at the unprecedented and ongoing Republican attacks on higher education, scientific research, freedom of speech, and human rights.”
“The students and faculty who are protesting in peaceful defiance of these senseless and often cruel actions should be commended for their conviction,” the joint statement read.

Research funding
Rally-goes and lawmakers also spoke out about the Trump administration’s cuts to scientific research funding. 
The National Institutes of Health has terminated nearly 800 research grants at academic institutions across the country. Last month, NIH announced that the funding it provides to grantees for “indirect costs” — like laboratory, utility and administrative personnel costs — would be limited to 15% of the grant award. Currently, the average indirect cost rate is between 27% and 28%, though some organizations have rates that are much higher, according to the agency.
Connecticut joined 21 other states in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration shortly after the cuts were announced. In April, a federal judge permanently blocked implementation of the cuts, but the administration is now appealing that decision. 
Blumenthal spoke about the critical role that NIH funding has played in advancing life-saving treatments. “Many illnesses, including aids and breast cancer, kill far fewer Americans now than they did 30 years ago, due to medical advancements developed at our universities. Technological innovations made in engineering labs across the country have grown our economy year after year.” 
Jeff Wickersham, a professor of medicine who’s been at Yale for 15 years working on HIV treatment and prevention, told the crowd on the Cross Campus quad that in March of this year he’d received his first ever NIH grant termination notice. 
“There is a chokehold on funding right now,” Wickersham said. “Only 50% of the funds that should have been awarded so far this year have been awarded, and we are here today to say: No. Stop this.”

Cuts to medical research also resonated at UConn, where Blagojevic said he feared what it could mean for people like him. As a cancer survivor, he said, “every single drug in my chemo regimen was developed in full or in part by NIH research.”
“So thank God that Republicans didn’t cut NIH 20 years ago because I would be dead right now,” Blagojevic said. “We’re not just talking about numbers on a spreadsheet. We’re not just talking about numbers on a budget report. These are human lives. These are our futures.”
Adam McCready, who works within UConn’s Neag School of Education, said his department is also facing cuts. His team had been working on research regarding the connection between student technology and digital literacy, school intervention and the impact on academic outcomes for middle schoolers, but the work was cut short abruptly and without notice, he said.
“Our work and some of our team members livelihoods are in jeopardy, all because it was deemed wasteful spending,” McCready said before leading a chant. 
“No research, no knowledge, no progress,” the crowd shouted.

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Teachers are celebrating near-passage of a South Carolina bill advocates have been pushing for years as a major help in recruiting and retaining educators.
The bill, dubbed the “Educator Assistance Act,” received unanimous approval from senators Wednesday, marking the first time it’s gotten a vote in the chamber.
The legislation will not only significantly improve teachers’ lives but send the message that legislators respect teachers as professionals, supporters said.
“This is a huge win,” said Patrick Kelly, a high school teacher who lobbies for the Palmetto State Teachers Association. “I cannot overstate how big of a win this will be for teachers’ working conditions.”
If the House, which again approved the legislation earlier this year, agrees to the Senate’s changes, the bill will head to Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk.
Its main sponsor, Rep. Shannon Erickson — the Beaufort Republican who leads the House’s education committee — said she’s hopeful that’s what will happen.
The House passed a different version of the bill last session, and legislators have proposed parts of it to varying levels of success over the past several years. The Senate didn’t take up the bill last year mainly because of timing issues, not because senators didn’t support the idea, said Sen. Greg Hembree, chair of the Senate Education Committee.
“It’s good all-around for the teachers and the students,” said Hembree, R-Little River. “I’m glad we got it done.”
As teacher pay has risen in recent years, the number of teacher vacancies in the state has dropped, though it remains far above the number reported before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the state’s Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention, and Advancement. While pay is a major issue for teachers, hiring and keeping people in teaching jobs will require more than increasing minimum salaries, Kelly said.
In talking to teachers over the years, Kelly has heard three major complaints from teachers beyond compensation: more support, more planning time and more respect. Many districts have already implemented parts of the bill, but requiring it across the board will help teachers in districts without such policies, he said.
SC bill would require schools to excuse some extracurricular absences

A major piece of the bill is requiring school districts to include a teacher’s expected minimum salary in their contract. Because those contracts are due May 10, before legislators pass their final budget and school districts have decided how much to pay teachers, most educators sign on without knowing how much they’ll get paid.
“I can’t think of any other profession where signing a contract without knowing your salary would be acceptable,” Kelly said.
The bill would also not allow district officials to reassign a teacher to another school or subject during the school year with less than five school days of notice unless the superintendent can prove it’s for a good reason. That gives teachers peace of mind knowing they’ll be teaching the class for which they signed up, advocates have said.
Teachers would also get guaranteed planning time under the bill. Current law allows districts to give teachers up to two days of planning, but it’s not required, meaning many districts eat up that time with professional development meetings, advocates have said. The proposal would set aside two days free of meetings for teachers to plan.
That change may not seem like much, but it makes a world of difference for teachers preparing for a new year, Kelly said.
“That is critically important to making sure efficient instruction can happen on day one,” Kelly said.
When teachers do have to attend professional development trainings, the bill would allow them to count those hours toward the 120 continuing education credits they’re required to obtain every five years in order to renew their teaching certificates. Requiring both has created a process advocates have said is often redundant and time-consuming.
“To stop the merry-go-round of having to deal with your certification is a huge, huge step,” Erickson said.
The biggest change senators made to the bill would allow teachers to move to a different part of the state without breaking their contract.
Currently, teachers who move after signing their contract can lose their ability to teach for up to a year. That meant teachers who needed to move for personal reasons, such as a spouse taking a job in a different part of the state, had to choose between finding a way to stay or being unable to teach that school year, teachers’ advocates have said.
One part of the bill that stood out to Hembree would allow teachers to donate their unused sick days to other colleagues. When he was solicitor in Horry and Georgetown counties, his office used a similar program. When two of his employees were diagnosed with cancer, they found the extra sick days invaluable, he said.
“That’s not going to come up a lot, but boy, when it does, it can make a difference in someone’s life,” Hembree said.
Teachers’ advocates said the bill is a major step forward, but they want to see more in future years.
Changing policies means little without good leadership, Kelly said. He encouraged legislators to continue finding ways to recruit and train principals and superintendents who can support the teachers in their schools.
Sherry East, president of the South Carolina Education Association, said she’d like to see longer windows for teachers to break their contracts and move to a different district, since job openings are often not posted until after the signing deadline, she said.
“We like it,” East said of the bill. “It could’ve gone a little further, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/admin-ajax-2.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 17:12:20.968408
,DC,2025-04-17 20:54:31+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. Supreme Court to hear case on Trump’s birthright citizenship order,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-hear-case-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court announced Thursday it will hear oral arguments next month over President Donald Trump’s efforts to restructure birthright citizenship, though the justices won’t decide on the merits of the case just yet. Instead, they will choose whether to leave in place nationwide injunctions from lower courts that so far have blocked the Trump administration from implementing the executive order.The oral arguments, scheduled for May 15, will likely provide the first indication of whether any of the nine justices are interested in revisiting the Court’s interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which was ratified in 1868 following the Civil War.The amendment states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”The Supreme Court ruled in 1898 in United States v.

The […],"Wisconsin Elections Commissioner Robert Spindell arrives at Milwaukee Central Count with Sen. Ron Johnson (Photo | Isiah Holmes)Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) Chair Ann Jacobs said at a meeting Thursday that the body is still investigating how the City of Madison lost nearly 200 ballots during the 2024 presidential election. 
The city of Madison announced in late December that 193 unprocessed absentee ballots had been found in the weeks following the election. The discovered ballots weren’t enough to sway the results of any contests, but WEC began an investigation into the error to determine what caused it and how similar mistakes can be prevented in future elections. 
On Thursday, Jacobs said that she and Republican commissioner Don Millis had already taken depositions of former Madison city clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl and members of her staff but that there was more work to be done and depositions to conduct with employees of Madison and Dane County. She added that those other interviews were delayed until after the April 1 election. 
Witzel-Behl, who had already been on administrative leave during the spring elections, resigned from her position as Madison city clerk earlier this week after nearly two decades in the role during which time she oversaw more than 60 elections. 
Jacobs said the investigation has already highlighted ways the state can improve its absentee ballot processes. 
“On a positive note, I do think the information we’re learning from the work we’ve done so far will help inform some best practices for tracking absentee ballots, making sure all absentee ballots are counted timely, and as we move to amend our manuals and update them … I really do think that what we’ve learned is going to help us do a better job there on some of that absentee ballot processing,” she said. 
After the update on the investigation, Republican commissioner Robert Spindell began remarks that devolved into a shouting match with Jacobs. 
Spindell began by noting how long Witzel-Behl had been the Madison clerk. 
“I think it’s fine that we’re doing this investigation of the city of Madison, or the misplacement of some [193] ballots and then not properly following through when they were found,” he said. “But I do want to commend the Madison clerk for her 20-plus years service.” 
Spindell then transitioned into what he said he believes is a “more serious problem” — some Milwaukee polling places running out of ballots during the April 1 election. On Election Day earlier this month, seven polling sites ran out of ballots, causing city officials to scramble to replenish supplies. The delay caused long lines to form at some polls. 
City election officials said they generally determine how many ballots to print and distribute to poll locations by assessing voter turnout in previous similar elections. But this year Wisconsin and Milwaukee broke turnout records for a spring election. 
A former member of the Milwaukee Elections Commission who previously sparked controversy when he celebrated and took credit for the low turnout among Black voters in the 2022 midterm elections, Spindell has often been extremely critical of the administration of Milwaukee’s elections. 
Republicans have often attacked Milwaukee’s election administration, resulting in frequent, baseless accusations that the city’s election results are fraudulent. 
Before Spindell could finish his statement, Jacobs banged her gavel, saying she was ruling his comment out of order, but Spindell just got louder and continued. 
Wisconsin open meetings law requires that if a government body such as the elections commission is going to discuss an issue at a meeting, it must have been properly listed on the meeting’s announced agenda. 
“I am not going to let you keep going,” Jacobs said. “I’m going to talk over you until you stop. You must stop. You are out of order, and I will eject you from this meeting. Do you understand the words I am saying? They are simple. You are out of order. The City of Milwaukee is not on this agenda. You do not get to hijack the agenda. You are not the chair. When you are chair you get to put things on the agenda, it’s not on the agenda.” 
Even though most of what he said was inaudible, Spindell ended by saying “I’ve said what I needed to say.” 
During the meeting, the commission also approved the design for a mailer that will be sent to voters who haven’t voted in four years to ask if they still live at the addresses listed in their voter registrations and informing them they risk having their registrations deactivated. The commissioners also  received an update on an audit to determine if any people currently serving felony sentences voted in recent elections and moved forward an administrative rule that would keep the home addresses of judicial candidates off public elections paperwork.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
The man, who was arrested Wednesday after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger on his way to his job in Tallahassee, is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up, even though Leon County authorities dropped his first-degree misdemeanor charge.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,’” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
 ‘I can’t do anything for their brother’

The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.
The Georgia Recorder, a partner of Florida Phoenix, has submitted a public records request to obtain more information about his arrest Sunday. This is a developing story and will be updated.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4260-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 17:12:20.968408

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Kentucky’s economy is the nation’s most reliant on global trade, according to a new study that looks at the potential impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on housing prices.
The study found that imports into Kentucky equal 32.3% of the state’s gross domestic product, the highest of any state, while exports make up 16.3% of Kentucky GDP, behind only Louisiana and Texas. 
“With robust manufacturing logistics, the state has become a key player in facilitating the movement of goods across borders,” explains the report from the National Association of Realtors.  
Trump promises that his taxes on imports will move manufacturing jobs back to this country and raise revenue to pay for tax cuts. His approach has drawn the support of union president Shawn Fain of the United Auto Workers. Trump, who ran on a promise to impose tariffs, won 65% of Kentucky votes last year.
But both of Kentucky’s U.S. senators — Republicans Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul — have broken with the Republican president to oppose his new tariffs. The Kentucky Chamber of Commerce also is voicing opposition to Trump’s trade policy as the numbers suggest Kentucky could be a casualty in a brewing trade war. 
Predicting “unnecessary disruptions” to Kentucky’s  economy, the state Chamber says Trump’s plans could hurt auto manufacturers, distillers and farmers. China recently responded to Trump by increasing its tariff on U.S. soybeans from 60% to 115%. Soybeans are Kentucky’s third most valuable farm commodity, behind poultry and corn. China buys more than half of U.S. soybean exports.
Other states’ foreign trade accounts post bigger numbers, but trade is more significant to Kentucky because of its smaller economy.
Ranging from parts for manufacturing to consumer electronics, imports’ prominence in Kentucky “reflects the state’s deep integration into the global market — especially in pharmaceuticals and automotive industries. Its top import partners are Mexico, Japan, and Taiwan,” says the study by Nadia Evangelou, an economist with the Realtors trade group.
Exports are goods produced and sold to international buyers. “It might surprise some, but Kentucky exports a significant number of cars and aerospace parts. Major companies such as Toyota and GE Aviation operate there. The primary partners are Canada, the U.K., and France, with over $4.5 billion in exports to each country,” says the study 
States like Kentucky and Texas that rely on both imports and exports “are more likely to experience the ripple effects of global supply chain shifts, both positive and negative,” the study says. Indiana, Michigan, and South Carolina also rank high on both exports and imports. “A surge in global demand supports their growth, while disruptions, such as factory shutdowns overseas or sudden tariffs, can present challenges as well.” 
Jason Bailey, executive director of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said the state’s manufacturing base reflects both parts imports and product exports and that “strategic tariffs have a role to play as part of a broader industrial policy aimed at key industries, of which Kentucky has several including automobiles and aircraft.”
He also predicts bad outcomes from Trump’s approach. “These across-the-board and on-again, off-again tariffs throw the economy into chaos and uncertainty and cut off the opportunity for trade relationships that are mutually beneficial and that, with good policy, can create better jobs both here and abroad.”
Invoking an emergency law, Trump has imposed, and in some cases later modified, a variety of tariffs, including a 10% tariff on most imports, an extra 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 145% tariff on China. He also imposed — but then paused for 90 days — what he calls reciprocal tariffs on more than 60 trading partners. Trump has levied import fees on iron and steel and a 25% levy on imported car parts due to begin May 3. The Associated Press reports confusion over Trump administration exemptions from the new tariffs for some electronics. The uncertainty is roiling stock and bond values.
Over the last 30 years, the study says, economic growth has been less robust in states like Kentucky that are highly reliant on trade, both in terms of job creation and housing values, probably because of their dependence on manufacturing which has been in decline. 
The study says large states where exports are a small part of GDP like New York, Florida and California have economies driven more by services in finance, tourism and entertainment.
“The states that led in home price growth were often those with rapid job growth in tech and services, high levels of domestic migration, and limited housing supply or zoning constraints,” writes Evangelou.



Kentucky tied deeply to global supply chains

“Kentucky is an automotive manufacturing powerhouse, with four major assembly plants and hundreds of auto parts facilities driving $5 billion worth of auto-related exports annually,” says a story about the economic study on realtor.com.
“Pharmaceutical manufacturing in the state drives $3.8 billion worth of exports, while aerospace exports a total of $19 billion.
“Those industries tie Kentucky deeply into global supply chains and rely on imports of components and precursors, with annual imports to the state totaling $94 billion. 
“Kentucky’s most famous product, bourbon, is also responsible for $500 million in exports each year. The state’s top import partners are Mexico, Japan, and Taiwan, while its top export recipients are Canada, the U.K., and France.”

Dan McKee has submitted a budget amendment seeking to reduce bureaucratic hurdles hounding the Department of Housing's governance structure. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Under a budget amendment filed by Gov. Dan McKee on Wednesday, the Rhode Island Department of Housing would be renamed the Executive Office of Housing in a move designed to consolidate state housing governance.
Changes stem from a 141-page report that Housing Secretary Deborah Goddard submitted to state leaders at the end of 2024. The General Assembly as part of its fiscal year 2025 budget had asked the Department of Housing to review and recommend ways to streamline housing governance across Rhode Island as part of the state’s fiscal year 2025 budget.
“By introducing this budget amendment, in collaboration with the Department of Housing, we are taking a critical step toward creating a more efficient and unified housing governance structure,” McKee said in a statement. “This is about providing real, lasting solutions for Rhode Islanders, and I am committed to making them a reality.”
Under the plan, the state would merge the Housing Resources Commission and the Advisory Council to the 20-member Interagency Council on Homelessness into a single advisory body. 
The existing Housing Resources Commission consists of 18 members from the public and private sectors. The Interagency Council on Homelessness met for the first time in seven years last December with the intention to reform its advisory council once the budget amendment is approved, said Housing Department spokesperson Emily Marshall.
State law requires at least three members of the advisory council be involved with the homeless community.
McKee’s amendment would codify the Secretary of Housing as the permanent chair of the board of commissioners for RIHousing, the quasi-state agency that finances affordable home construction. 
New year, new potential name for R.I.’s housing department

The new Executive Office of Housing would also take over administration of the state’s Housing Production Fund. Created by the General Assembly in 2021, the fund is supported by real estate transfer tax revenue and has been managed by RIHousing.
Officials at RIHousing are still reviewing McKee’s budget amendment, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer Christine Hunsinger told Rhode Island Current.
Such changes would help state agencies work better together to clear some of the regulatory redundancies stunting Rhode Island’s housing development, according to the announcement from the governor’s office.
“The state’s housing challenges require a unified and coordinated approach,” Housing Secretary Deborah Goddard said in a statement. “By implementing these structural changes, we can ensure that the state’s resources are being used effectively, and that we are making measurable progress in addressing the housing needs of Rhode Islanders.”
Housing officials want to have 15,000 total new homes permitted by 2030, but getting new homes built has been incremental at best.
The department’s latest integrated housing report released Tuesday found that between 2021 and 2024, Rhode Island added 4,365 new units — representing a 0.9% increase to its housing stock between those three years. The state permitted 2,655 new units for 2024, according to the report.
McKee’s office said the governor believes the department’s governance recommendations are what the state needs to produce long-term benefits for Rhode Island’s housing sector, along with reducing homelessness.
At least 2,442 unhoused people across Rhode Island were counted when volunteers from the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness conducted an annual survey in late January 2024 — up 35% from the 2023 count. ​The coalition conducted its annual Point-In-Time count for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Jan. 28, but results aren’t expected to be released until some time in the summer. 
Every three years starting around July 1, 2026, the department must create a statewide plan to address and end homelessness. 
But affordable housing advocates have concerns about the state’s ability to take on more responsibility — especially as uncertainty continues over federal funding toward housing projects. 
“Over 75% of the funding that we get for housing and homelessness programs comes from the federal government,” HousingWorks RI Director Brenda Clement, who serves on the Housing Resources Commission, said in an interview Thursday. “I don’t want to create something in state government that is not fundable.” 
Clement declined to comment on the state’s plan to create a single advisory body.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has not yet reviewed the governor’s amendment, chamber spokesperson Larry Berman said in an email Thursday. The House Committee on Finance is expected to schedule a public hearing some time after lawmakers return from their April recess next week.
The State House this year is considering a dozen new proposals in a  package of bills aiming to encourage new home construction including legislation that would make it easier to subdivide oversized lots, allow vacant or unused state-owned land to be developed, and encourage municipalities to convert vacant commercial space into homes.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas became the first state in the nation to prevent healthcare conglomerates from operating drugstores here when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 on Wednesday.
State law already regulates what pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) pay to reimburse independent pharmacies, but pharmacists have complained that the companies violate the law. The state has also fined four PBMs a total of $1.47 million for paying Arkansas pharmacies below the legally required amount for prescription drugs.
PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.
HB 1150 headed to Sanders’ desk April 9 after clearing the Senate with a bipartisan 26 votes, six days after it passed the House with 89 votes. The bill generated hours of discussion and public comment in the House and Senate committees on Insurance and Commerce this month.
“These massive corporations are attacking our state because we will be the first in the country to hold them accountable for their anticompetitive actions,” Sanders said in a statement Wednesday.
CVS Health issued a statement last week urging Sanders to veto HB 1150, calling it “misguided policy.” The organization, which includes the CVS Caremark PBM, issued another statement Wednesday afternoon.
“CVS Health welcomes a good faith discussion with policy makers in Arkansas and across the country on ways to make medicine more affordable and accessible,” the statement said. “Unfortunately, HB1150 is bad policy that accomplishes just the opposite: it will take away access to pharmacy care in local communities, hike prescription drug spending across the state by millions of dollars each year, and cost hundreds of Arkansans their jobs.”

Federal regulator: Pharmacy middlemen appear to be raising prices, hurting patients

 

Arkansas has 23 CVS pharmacies that CVS and other opponents of HB 1150 said will be forced to close under the new law. Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said this is not true and pharmacies can still operate if they detach from PBMs.
Sanders, Vinson and other supporters of HB 1150 have said a lack of sufficient regulation of PBMs has allowed them to monopolize the pharmaceutical industry by setting their competitors’ prices.
OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — the three largest PBMs — are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 The legal landscape

Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018 prohibit PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their competitors, locally owned independent pharmacies. PBMs routinely break these laws, said Vinson and HB 1150’s Republican sponsors, Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton and Rep. Jeremiah Moore of Clarendon.
PBMs have allegedly also violated Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs. Pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) thousands of complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, independent pharmacists and AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year.

Pharmacy benefit managers will have to pay Arkansas drugstores dispensing fees under new rule

 

This led the Arkansas Legislative Council to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs. The panel approved the rule a day after its Administrative Rules subcommittee rejected it.
Hammer told the Senate Insurance committee April 8 that the Legislature should not be “rewarding” violators of state law “by letting them stay in business.”
“Congress is pursuing this issue. Why? Because states like Arkansas are not sitting on the sidelines and being quiet about it,” Hammer said. “[If you say], ‘Let’s sit back and wait for Congress,’ like sitting back and waiting for the Lord to come, it ain’t going to happen soon enough.”
After more than a century serving Hammer’s constituents in Benton, Smith-Caldwell Drug Store closed in August 2023 due to financial insolvency and transferred its clients to Walgreens, a national chain that isn’t part of a PBM.
Brad Lawson, a Little Rock-based healthcare supervisor for Walgreens, told lawmakers in December that unfair PBM reimbursements have forced the company to close several locations and plan further closures nationwide.
Walgreens declined to comment Thursday on HB 1150.
 Opposition

In an April 4 interview with the Advocate, CVS leaders said the Caremark PBM not only complies with Arkansas law but also reimburses independent pharmacies at a higher rate than its own chain pharmacies. They also said employers whose health insurance plans include CVS will face higher costs.











This is not grassroots opposition to this bill. This is astroturf.


– Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, who supported HB 1150



“Patients are choosing us, they have a choice, and I think we’re not allowing patients to have a choice in this bill,” Chief Pharmacy Officer Lucille Accetta said.
When asked about HB 1150’s potential financial impact on CVS, Accetta and Vice President of External Relations David Whitrap said the losses of pharmacists’ jobs and patients’ access to medication are higher priorities than money.
CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 and 900 more stores between 2021 and 2024.
CVS District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis spoke against the bill at both Insurance and Commerce committee meetings, saying she and her colleagues would lose their jobs if HB 1150 becomes law.
Ellis lives in Greenbrier, represented by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View. Irvin was in the minority of Senate committee members to vote against HB 1150, and she said she would not vote for a constituent to lose her job.
Hammer said the potential loss of CVS employees’ jobs is “a lie.”
“If they want to argue these local [corporate] pharmacies shouldn’t be going out of business because they get paid adequately, fine,” he said. “Put your money where your mouth is. Prove it. Start paying yourselves like you’re paying these others.”
Several lawmakers said this month that they supported HB 1150 partly because they received emails urging them to vote against it that appeared to be from constituents but turned out to be from lobbyists opposing the legislation. Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, told the House Insurance Committee that CVS clients in his district had not consented to their names being used for this purpose.

Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, told the equivalent Senate committee that he received similar misleading emails.
“This is not grassroots opposition to this bill,” Johnson said. “This is astroturf.”
Besides CVS Health, opponents of HB 1150 included the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, the Navitus Health Solutions PBM, and the Omnicare and Accredo pharmacies.
Omnicare is owned by CVS Health, and Accredo is a subsidiary of Express Scripts.
 Mail order concerns

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding.
Opponents of HB 1150 said it would reduce patients’ access to specialty drugs, some of which might only be accessible via mail-order services — including for military members and veterans who receive pharmaceuticals via the Tricare insurance program’s partnership with Express Scripts.
HB 1150 allows the State Board of Pharmacy to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Hammer told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.
Despite being a veteran on Tricare, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s pharmacy services have been moved from one provider to another by PBM interference, he said in January at a news conference announcing HB 1150. He also said he would defend the legislation in court if it were challenged.
On Monday, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in HB 1150 to be enacted federally.
Griffin sued Express Scripts and OptumRX last year, alleging that they used data from drug manufacturers and distributors to maximize their financial gain instead of using it to mitigate the opioid addiction epidemic.

 ‘Winners and losers’

Irvin was one of nine senators, mostly Republicans, to vote against HB 1150 last week. She disputed the claim that PBMs have a monopoly in the pharmaceutical industry, saying this is only an opinion without a court’s declaration.
Senate Minority Whip Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, was the chamber’s only Democrat to vote against the bill. Love’s district does not have any local independent pharmacies, and his constituents will lose access to medications if corporate pharmacies like CVS close, he said.
“They’ve been talking to me saying, ‘Guess what? This will hurt us,’” Love said. “So we’re going to manufacture a pharmacy desert in southwest Little Rock? That’s not good for my people.”
Irvin also took issue with a statement April 8 from Greg Reybold, vice president of Healthcare Policy at the American Pharmacy Cooperative, that HB 1150 will “take the ball away” from PBMs in Arkansas’ pharmacy industry.
“We’re using the government to say, ‘We’re getting rid of your competition,’” Irvin said. “…It says that we’re denying a permit to be approved for you, but not for you. You’re picking winners and losers.”

GOP Sen. Justin Boyd, a Fort Smith pharmacist and the vice chairman of the Senate Insurance committee, argued that PBMs’ ability to set their competitors’ prices is actually “picking winners and losers.”
Another 2025 Arkansas law that supporters said will increase patients’ access to medication is Act 52, which removed the state’s ban on nonprofit hospitals holding pharmacy permits. The bill, co-sponsored by Irvin, initially failed in the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee but later passed after being amended.
The Arkansas Pharmacists Association opposed Act 52 before it was amended. Vinson told the Senate Insurance committee that Act 52 will create new pharmacy jobs that could make up for any job loss brought about by HB 1150. Both laws will go into effect in August.

(Photo via Wells Police Facebook)After federal immigration authorities accepted Maine’s first police department into an official partnership earlier this month, some community members are now requesting police terminate the contract. 
The crux of the rift between the community and police: uncertainty and disagreement over how they expect the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program will operate in practice. 
Revived under President Donald Trump’s administration to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, those pushing back on Wells’ participation in the program argue it entangles their local police with a federal agency that has been accused of disregarding due process. 
Four community members asked the Wells Select Board on Tuesday night to direct the police department to dissolve the agreement, arguing the department should have first consulted the public and raising concern about the program’s history of abuse. Before Trump reinstated the program, it was discontinued in 2012 after the discovery of discriminatory practices, including racial profiling.
But Wells police leadership argue the agreement doesn’t mean their local agency will adopt ICE’s recent approach to arrests. Rather, Wells Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam told Maine Morning Star she entered into the agreement to take advantage of a training opportunity and streamline work flow.
First Maine police department joins ICE partnership

As first reported by Maine Morning Star, the Wells Police Department was the first — and so far only — agency in Maine to sign an agreement under the 287(g) program, which permits local officers to arrest people on immigration violations, an authority otherwise reserved for federal agents. 
Wells’ agreement is specifically for 287(g)’s “task force model,” which ICE describes as a “force multiplier” to allow law enforcement agencies to enforce limited immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties. 287(g)’s other two models are focused on investigating people who have already been arrested and booked in local jails. 
As of April 16, ICE had signed 456 Memorandums of Agreement for 287(g) programs covering 38 states, with task force agreements with 190 agencies in 23 states, including Wells. 
Putnam said ICE has informed her department that the training includes 40 hours of online courses, which the department had yet to begin as of this week. The department submitted to ICE a list of officers eligible to participate in the program, who must have two years of police experience and be a U.S. citizen, which Putnam said is the majority of the department.
Regarding when arrests for immigration violations could begin after that, “We don’t know,” Putnam said. “We haven’t been told when to start.” 
Residents raise concern about ‘larger’ enforcement picture
The memorandum of understanding ICE signed with Wells Police permits its officers once trained to interrogate any “person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or remain in the United States” and “arrest without warrant any alien entering or attempting to unlawfully enter the United States in the officer’s presence or view,” among other capabilities otherwise reserved for federal authorities. 
But Putnam said when Wells officers start enforcing immigration violations through the agreements, they will only act on existing federal warrants that have had judicial review. 
Normally, she said, when local police run a license and discover an existing federal warrant for an immigration offense, they have to wait for federal authorities to make an arrest. The agreement eliminates that redundancy, Putnam said.

“We’re not rounding up undocumented people,” said Wells Police Captain Kevin Chabot. “Wells Police does not do proactive immigration enforcement.” 
Putnam said regardless of what the partnership allows, “We’re doing what I’m telling you we’re going to do, and that’s it.”
Putnam has repeatedly told Maine Morning Star that she hopes Mainers have confidence in their local law enforcement officers who’ll be carrying out the work. But a lack of trust in local authorities is not why some are objecting to the ICE agreement. 
“It’s not a matter of not trusting the chief and her force,” Cheryl Dearman Mills, one of the people who spoke at the select board meeting, told Maine Morning Star. “As I read the [memorandum of understanding], it raises concerns about control and future entanglement with ICE.”
The memorandum also states that local police have the authority to serve and execute warrants of arrest for immigration violations, issue immigration detainers and prepare charging documents.
Others who called for the select board to terminate the ICE agreement similarly said their concern was with local police formalizing a relationship with an agency that appears, at times, to be acting outside of the law.
“Chief Putnam was looking at this contract primarily with a local focus, separate from the larger picture of ICE’s current tactics of enforcement and deportation,” Wells resident Mary Marra told the select board. “And I was seeing this agreement primarily from a broader focus and how ICE’s questionable and sometimes illegitimate enforcement reflects very poorly on our town.”
For example, Marra pointed to masked immigration officers detaining Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk for allegedly supporting Hamas by co-authoring an op-ed calling for the school to divest from companies with ties to Israel, as well as the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.
This week in Florida, a U.S.-born citizen was arrested for entering the state as an “unauthorized alien.” His mother and a community advocate showed his birth certificate during a hearing, but the judge said she had no authority to release him, as reported by Maine Morning Star’s sister outlet the Florida Phoenix. 
“This is Wells Police acting as ICE agents in certain situations and I am extremely uncomfortable with what ICE is doing,” said another Wells resident, Peg Duddy, who is calling for the termination of the ICE contract. 
Duddy and others have met on-on-one with Putnam, as well as attended meetings with the chief and her leadership team, including one hosted by the Wells Democratic Town Committee Wednesday night. 










They don’t want ICE in their town. This is one way of hopefully keeping them out of town.


– Jo-Ann Putnam, Wells Police Chief


“They don’t want ICE in their town,” Putnam said of attendees after the meeting. “This is one way of hopefully keeping them out of town.” 
Duddy and Dearman Mills told Maine Morning Star that the meeting did not change their opposition and that they will continue to push for the contract to be terminated. More immediately, they’re requesting at minimum a 90-day pause, which they said would afford time to clarify the work Wells Police will engage in through the agreement. 
“Also to evaluate where the national picture is in 90 days,” Duddy said, “because this is not in isolation from that.”
Chair of the Wells Select Board John MacLeod III did not respond to a request for comment about the community members’ requests.
Putnam said she’s having meetings with various groups — places of worship, the local Chamber of Commerce, businesses who employ immigrants on work visas — to answer questions about the ICE agreement but said she’s not reconsidering it in light of pushback from some community members. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, she said.
Immigration enforcement in Maine
Data posted on the ICE website listed the Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities, with a pending application earlier this month but ICE has since removed the department from that list and also does not indicate an agreement has been signed. ICE, Monmouth Winthrop Police Chief Paul Ferland and Lieutenant Dana Wessling did not respond to requests for comment regarding whether the application was terminated and why. 
Such agreements could face legal hurdles as Democrats in the Maine Legislature proposed legislation to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies or officers from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities. The bill has yet to have a public hearing. 
Aside from 287(g) agreements, an uptick in immigration detentions have revealed increased federal operations in Maine. Cumberland County Jail in Portland had 122 people detained under ICE orders last month, according to data Maine Morning Star obtained through a Freedom of Access Act request. 
According to attorneys, while some of these people were arrested in the state, the majority appear to be transferred from other states and are quickly transferred out too, signaling that federal authorities are using Maine as a tool in its “mass deportation” goal.
“It’s crucial for Maine’s people to know how their public officials may be supporting federal immigration enforcement, which often violates people’s constitutional rights,” ACLU of Maine Staff Attorney Anahita Sotoohi said in a statement on Thursday, after the organization filed information requests seeking a more comprehensive picture of local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities. 
“Abuses of power and attacks on due process threaten all people, regardless of immigration status,” Sotoohi said. “When due process is undermined for some, all people are at risk as power is consolidated and our system of checks and balances is dismantled.”

The South Carolina Supreme Court will not stop efforts to remove state Loftis from office. (Photo by Mark Susko/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The South Carolina Supreme Court will not stop efforts to remove state Treasurer Curtis Loftis from office.
“This matter is not yet ripe for the court’s consideration,” the justices wrote in a joint opinion Thursday, throwing out the treasurer’s lawsuit that sought to halt the so-called “removal on address” process.
That means senators can continue with proceedings as scheduled Monday, when they’ll weigh whether Loftis “willfully neglected his duties” for his role in a $1.8 billion accounting error that went unreported for nearly a decade.
For more than a year, Loftis has maintained he did nothing wrong and compared the Senate-led investigation to a political “witch hunt.” Loftis said he’s prepared to make his case.
“We know this process will be more political theatrics than the formal trial one would expect to overturn a statewide election,” he said in a statement. “We stand ready to show the citizens of South Carolina that the State Treasurer’s Office has faithfully fulfilled our statutory duties to provide core financial management services to state government. I certainly hope that the senators will agree with us once all the information is shared.”
South Carolina’s accounting problems, which involved almost no actual money, stem from the changeover from the state’s legacy accounting system to a new one.
During the process, a series of electronic ledger entries made it appear the state had $1.8 billion sitting untouched in a fund with no record of where it was supposed to go. The state’s financial officials never alerted the General Assembly to the issue.
A forensic accounting firm hired by the state ultimately found staff had made the entries in error and all but $200 million of the money was never real.
Facing his own “removal on address,” former Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom — the state’s chief accountant for 20 years — resigned in 2023 over a separate but related accounting blunder. And former State Auditor George Kennedy resigned in January.
But Loftis has refused to step down and re-affirmed to reporters that no matter what happens Monday, he will be running for re-election in 2026 even if he has to go deep into his own pockets to fund a campaign.
As an elected official, Loftis can’t be fired. But the Legislature can remove him using an obscure constitutional measure, which has a lower bar than impeachment and applies when an official commits willful neglect of duty rather than a serious crime.
Under the process, the governor must remove an executive officer from office if two-thirds of both chambers of the Legislature vote to remove him.
While the Senate has invoked the procedure, it’s unclear what the House will do — if anything. Only Democrat Rep. Heather Bauer of Columbia has introduced legislation calling on the House to start impeachment proceedings.
“I don’t believe the Senate thinks they can actually get me out of office,” Loftis told the SC Daily Gazette. “They just want to make my life miserable so I leave.”
In his statement, Loftis also noted his court case “was not dismissed on the merits.” Rather, the justices, citing past case law, declined to declare the process unconstitutional because Loftis had yet to go through the removal proceedings.
The court dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning the treasurer could file again at a later date.

(Getty Images)Opponents are turning to legal challenges to try to block or delay major public transit expansions — even after voters approve them.
Recent lawsuits in Arizona, Tennessee and Texas have attempted to slow voted-passed projects.
In Nashville, Tennessee, voters passed a $3.1 billion referendum in November to raise the city sales tax half a cent and fund expanded bus service, pedestrian improvements and 54 miles of “all-access” transit corridors. But a Tennessee court, while upholding most of the project, ruled last week that the city could not use the funds raised to purchase land for affordable housing or parks.
The ruling affects only 1% of the total revenue, the court said. But it was a signal that even well-funded, voter-backed transit efforts are vulnerable to some legal roadblocks.
After voters in Maricopa County, Arizona, last year approved an extension of a half-cent sales tax for transportation, the county GOP sued to try to invalidate the results, arguing the vote didn’t meet a 60% supermajority.
In Austin, Texas, a 2024 class-action lawsuit attempted to block the city from collecting property taxes unless it excludes a tax approved by voters in 2020 to fund Project Connect — a major transit expansion. But a judge dismissed the lawsuit late last year.
No fare! Free bus rides raise questions of fairness, viability.

Public support for expanded transit is surging across the United States. In 2024 alone, voters approved 46 of 53 transit-related ballot measures, unlocking over $25 billion in new funding for transit projects and improvements, according to the American Public Transportation Association.
But despite support at the ballot box, cities often face legal, zoning and political barriers.
Nashville, in particular, is becoming a case study in both momentum and resistance to transit investment and development, according to researchers at the Urban Institute.
“There’s been a sea change,” said Gabe Samuels, a research analyst in the Housing and Communities Division at the Urban Institute. “Nashville had two failed transit referenda in the past decade. This time, it passed decisively. Voters want alternatives to sprawl and traffic.”
But transit-oriented development — the strategy of clustering housing and businesses near high-quality transit — is often hindered by outdated zoning, Samuels and colleague Yonah Freemark told Stateline.
According to an Urban Institute study, more than 90% of Nashville’s residential land is zoned for single- or two-family homes, a pattern common in Southern and Midwestern cities. That zoning limits the density needed to support high transit ridership, the report said. Currently, only 13% of Nashville’s housing lies within a quarter-mile, what the report calls easy walking distance, of its planned transit corridors.
“You’re investing millions — sometimes billions — into transit systems,” said Freemark. “If you’re not thinking about land use and density alongside that, you’re wasting the opportunity.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Following years of delays, federal and New Mexico officials say starting May 7 any adult wanting to catch a flight or enter certain federal buildings will need to show a driver’s license that meets stricter standards.
REAL IDs, marked with a gold star in the card’s top right corner, require proof of identity, age and residency to the state issuing the card. That often means using original documents such as a birth certificate, social security card and two proofs of address.

Passengers must present the actual physical card, or can use their digital REAL ID at some locations, including the Albuquerque Sunport and the Lea County Regional Airport.
The temporary paper ID issued from the state will not be accepted at the gates, J. Mark Heisey, the federal security director for the Transportation Security Administration, told Source NM Thursday.
If a driver’s license doesn’t meet the requirements, then people will need to use their passports, military-issued ID or other acceptable licenses to fly or enter federal buildings, he said.
The deadline for rolling out the requirements has been repeatedly pushed back since the federal law was first enacted in 2005 — but officials say this time, it’s real.
“The Secretary of Homeland Security is committed to enforcing this law that’s been in place since 2005,” Heisey said. “So, we’re finally at a tipping point.”
  Transportation Security Administration Federal Security Director J. Mark Heisey at the Albuquerque Sunport on April 17, 2025.
People who show up to the airport without a REAL ID driver’s license will face delays at TSA checkpoints, he said.
“Even if you don’t have plans to travel now, your plans can change, so prepare now, as far as what type of photo ID you’ll plan to bring to the airport,” Heisey said.
About 80% of the driver’s licenses issued in New Mexico are REAL IDs, said Stephanie Schardin Clarke, the Secretary of New Mexico Department of Taxation and Revenue, which oversees the state’s licensing. That means about 370,000 New Mexicans don’t have a REAL ID, and only have the standard driver’s license.
“Not all of them either want or are eligible or need a real ID,” Schardin Clarke said. “Some portion of those 20% might be planning to travel with a passport or other acceptable documentation; for example, some of them might not be eligible for reasons of documentation, and then some might just not plan to travel or enter a federal building.”
More about New Mexico Real IDs
Schardin Clarke said that New Mexico state offices and private Motor Vehicle Division offices are prepared for additional appointments for REAL IDs. All state offices now require an appointment, which can be made online or scheduled over the phone at 1-888-683-3466.
The state also has a frequently asked questions page for the documentation required to get a REAL ID for the first time.
Htet Wint, the director of the Motor Vehicle Division, said the state does require anyone with a name change — from marriage, divorce, adoption, etc. — to bring in additional documents.
“We need all the linking documents,” Wint said. “Like a marriage certificate, divorce decrees, court order, that ties them to that name.”
Physical cards take about two weeks to arrive in the mail. The mobile driver’s license downloaded to a digital wallet in a phone will take 24 hours to update.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Despite earlier statements that changes to annual school retirement contributions would not be used to balance Nebraska’s budget, lawmakers confirmed Thursday that the reductions will go toward that goal.
State senators gave 38-0 first-approval Thursday to Legislative Bill 645, from State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln at the request of Gov. Jim Pillen, to lower employer, employee and state contributions to the statewide school retirement plan based on its funding level compared to obligations to members. The plan is currently 99.91% funded.
The state retirement plan covers all eligible school employees, notably teachers, outside Omaha Public Schools, which has a separate retirement plan and is not as highly funded.
Currently, employees contribute to the group plan 9.78% of monthly payroll and school districts give 9.88% of the payroll paid to covered district employees. The state annually gives 2% of the statewide payroll for covered members. Payroll was about $2.5 billion in the past year.
‘Built-in protections’
Under Ballard’s bill, and an amendment adopted 41-0, contribution rates would change as follows:

Less than 96% funded — 9.75% employees, 9.85% employers, 2% state.
Between 96% funded and 98% funded — 8.75% employees, 8.84% employers, 0.7% state.
Between 98% and 100% funded — 8% employees, 8.08% employers, 0.7% state.
100% funded or more — 7.25% employees, 7.32% employers, 0% state.

“Importantly, these agreed-upon reductions in contributions have built-in protections to ensure the long-term sustainability of the fund,” said Ballard, chair of the Legislature’s Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee.

The amended LB 645 could save the state at least $80 million in the next two fiscal years, which multiple senators celebrated as helping to close the state’s projected budget shortfall of $457 million for the next two years.
That is prior to ongoing work by the Appropriations Committee, which has whittled the deficit down to about $100 million with continued negotiations. The budget bills must be presented to the Legislature by the end of the month for debate.
Health of the retirement plan
Opponents of Ballard’s measure, chiefly State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, said “political games” should not be played with teacher retirements, especially with what she said is “incredible economic volatility and uncertainty” under President Donald Trump.
“Playing Russian roulette with their retirement is wrong,” Conrad said Thursday.
If annual contributions in any year are not enough to keep the plan adequately funded under state law, such as if investment returns come up short or stock market returns are too volatile, the state is on the hook for additional funding outside of annual contributions. That happened in the late 2000s, leading to the current funding contribution levels in 2013 negotiations.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Appropriations Committee and a member of the Retirement Committee, described Ballard’s LB 645 as a “reasonable compromise.”
He said opponents blasting the bill as a “serious threat” to the plan is just “not true” and that employees would see no benefit reductions. Clements said it’s “the right thing to do at this time.”
“The plan is in good shape, and the state’s contribution would go back to a full amount if it’s below 96% [funded],” Clements said.

‘We’ve done something to ourselves’
State Sens. Mike Moser of Columbus and Jana Hughes of Seward said the contribution rates should have been examined without regard to the state budget, even if there was a surplus.
“If this retirement fund is funded at 100%, we should all raise our hands and say, ‘Halleluja,’” Moser said. “Funding it beyond 100% just does not make sense.”
Throughout the 2025 session, LB 645 has faced significant changes since it was first introduced in January.
At that time, only the state government would have seen a lowered contribution rate. Then, prior to a March hearing on LB 645, Ballard offered an amendment to change employee contribution rates. Now, employers who opposed the bill would also see lowered contribution rates.
School advocates have said the freed-up funds could lead to possibly lower property taxes or increased teacher pay, and many school advocacy groups are now in favor of the bill.
Ballard shared data from the Nebraska State Education Association estimating that the average school teacher could receive $1,000 more in take-home pay when the retirement plan is more than 98% funded, under LB 645. If the plan is fully funded, the take-home pay could be $1,500 each year.
State Sens. George Dungan of Lincoln, of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, and Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, on the Appropriations Committee, said the budget deficit is self-inflicted.
Dungan described it as an online meme where a young child puts a stick in the spike of his bicycle and flips over, asking, “Oh my God, who did this?”
“This kind of feels like we’ve done something to ourselves and now we are operating under this structure where we feel like our hands are tied and we have to do these things,” Dungan said.

A piece of the budget ‘puzzle’
State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, a member of the Revenue and Retirement Committees, described the situation as paying a bill twice.
“You don’t overfund pensions. You don’t overpay bills,” Sorrentino said. But you do have to have the wherewithal to make up for that when and if it gets to a certain level of funding.”
Conrad blamed “unsustainable, inequitable, reckless tax cuts,” and Cavanaugh said the Appropriations Committee “not once” discussed using the freed-up state retirement contributions to invest in education, contrary to earlier statements from the governor’s staff that the funds would not be used toward balancing the budget.
Kenny Zoeller, director of the governor’s policy research office, who made those commitments earlier this year, did not respond to a request for comment on what had changed. Ballard said he would like to balance the budget without raising taxes, such as by limiting spending.
State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams, a seven-year member of the Appropriations Committee, said that as of Wednesday the committee still had $100 million to find to balance the budget. 
He has often described the budget as a “giant puzzle,” stating Thursday that retirement contributions is one piece. If his colleagues chose not to adopt the retirement changes, Dorn said that would lead to cuts somewhere else.
“This is just one part of that puzzle,” Dorn said.

‘We shouldn’t rush’
The Retirement Committee will have a new hearing on an amendment to LB 645 next week that could expand retirement eligibility for employees hired after July 1, 2018. Currently, retirement eligibility is when age plus years of service meets or exceeds 85 years — “Rule of 85.” Workers hired before July 2018 can retire as early as age 55. Newer employees have to wait until at least age 60.
As a trade-off, the state would not provide any annual contributions to the retirement plan in the next two years, potentially saving nearly $20 million more, before contributions are set as now outlined in LB 645.
Tim Royers, president of the NSEA, said the organization was happy that LB 645 advanced, and is looking forward to next week’s hearing on correcting a “serious wrong.”
“We have a chance to make them whole, and that’s important,” he told the Nebraska Examiner.
Ballard said he’s unsure how the amendment would be received the Legislature before the hearing.
Conrad, the dean of the Legislature who competed against Ballard for chair of the Retirement Committee in January, losing 25-24 after a tied vote, said the amended LB 645 could very well be a “good deal” for school employees, but she urged caution.
“If indeed we can find a path forward, we shouldn’t rush,” Conrad said. “We shouldn’t rush with something this important.”

He […],"Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson speaks to reporters Thursday after being the lone Republican vote against a proposal to reinstate the abortion ban overturned by voters in November (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).The top Republican in the Missouri House said Thursday that a proposed constitutional amendment to ban abortion approved by his GOP colleagues doesn’t go far enough to protect victims of sexual assault. 
House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit was the lone Republican to vote against sending the bill to the Senate on Thursday. He didn’t express his concerns about the legislation while it was being debated for four hours on Tuesday or an hour on Thursday, instead saving his remarks for a press conference moments after the bill’s passage. 
The proposed amendment, if passed by the Senate and approved by voters, would repeal the reproductive rights amendment known as Amendment 3 but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation. 
In pregnancy, a woman’s first missed period marks four weeks gestation. Patterson, a physician, noted people who are younger or lower income and people who are Black and Hispanic are statistically more likely to learn they are pregnant later into the first trimester. 
On top of that, once a survivor learns they’re pregnant, Patterson said, they are dealing with not only the trauma of that attack, but also the logistics of getting in to see a doctor.
“A debate that we should have — and I hope happens in the Senate — is 12 weeks long enough,” Patterson said during the press conference. “ … If you’re going to say it’s OK to (have an abortion) after you’ve been raped, now we’re talking time limits.” 
State Rep. Yolanda Young, a Democrat from Kansas City, said during House debate on Thursday that bringing forward such an amendment “desecrated the sanctity of the majority.” 
Democrats have accused their colleagues across the aisle of attempting to subvert the will of the people by bringing to a vote a new abortion ban less than six months after Missouri became the first state to overturn a ban by guaranteeing the procedure up until fetal viability.
Patterson, who before the November election suggested the legislature should respect the will of the voters, said Thursday that “taking something to the voters another time isn’t really subverting the will of the voters.” 
“It really is something that I think should be celebrated,” he said, “that we have this process to amend the constitution, going back to the people and letting them have their say.”
But House Democrats remain critical of Republicans’ approach, saying the ballot language — the summary of the amendment that appears on the ballot — is deceptive. 
No where does the language mention the amendment would ban elective abortions.
Instead, Missourians would be asked if they want to amend the Missouri constitution to: 

“Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; 
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and 
Protect children from gender transition?”

If approved by the Senate, it will go to a statewide vote. House Majority Floor Leader Alex Riley, a Republican from Springfield, said in a press release Thursday that voters could see the amendment on their ballots in 2026. The statement did not mention the possibility of the governor calling a special election as soon as this year.
“This is not democracy in action,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City. “This is authoritarianism in action.” 
  Missouri House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, center, is surrounded by members the Democratic caucus Thursday at a news conference after the House passed a proposal to reinstate the abortion ban overturned by voters in November (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
As is already in place under Amendment 3, the legislation would protect women’s access to health care during miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies and other medical emergencies. It would also outlaw gender-affirming care for minors, something that is already banned in Missouri.
House Democrats took to the floor for an hour Thursday to oppose the legislation, sharing stories of pregnancy and abortion. 
“What continues to stick out to me is how different and how nuanced each person’s story is because our bodies are complicated and the health care needed to address any number of the situations that we find ourselves in is complicated,” Aune said. “So why do you keep trying to legislate this vital health care out of existence with a one-size-fits-all policy?” 
Proposed abortion ban amendment gets initial approval of Missouri House

State Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican who is carrying the legislation, said the amendment is necessary to protect women and children “by returning to safety standards.”
In addition to banning nearly all elective abortions, the amendment would reinstate several targeted regulations on abortion providers, or TRAP laws, that were recently struck down as unconstitutional by a Missouri judge.
“Voters in the past few years were given the choice between two extremes, choices with no middle ground,” Seitz said. “Zero abortions, or what we have now, a landscape that allows for unfettered access.”
Despite abortion becoming legal up to the fetal viability — generally considered to be near the end of the second trimester —  access remains precarious. Procedural abortions are currently only available in the first trimester at three Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri. 
Medication abortions remain inaccessible. 
While a number of House Republicans compromised by supporting the inclusion of exceptions for survivors, Democrats stood firmly opposed to any ban on the table.
“How many among us could have even an inkling of what it’s like to be trapped physically, financially, emotionally, in a body and a system that does not offer mercy, only mandates,” said state Rep. Kem Smith, a Democrat from Florissant, as she asked her colleagues to imagine themselves in the shoes of a woman in an underfunded, marginalized community who just turned over a positive pregnancy test. 
She was among several Black women in the House who spoke against the proposal, citing Black maternal mortality rates in Missouri. A 2023 report from the state’s Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review found Black mothers were three times more likely to die within a year of pregnancy than white mothers. 
“When we legislate health care decisions that only women can biologically face without guaranteeing the support systems that make parenting a viable option,” Smith said. “We’re not passing laws, we’re passing judgement.” 
The proposed amendment approved Thursday is similar to the Senate version approved by a committee earlier this year over objections from one Republican lawmaker who opposes any exception for rape or incest.

(Screenshot from Florida Channel)A top Florida Republican warned Thursday that the Hope Florida Foundation could lose its tax exempt status if two $5 million payments the foundation made to other nonprofit groups wound up with a political committee opposing legalization of marijuana.
Rep. Alex Andrade made the remarks to board members during a virtual meeting Thursday. He also said he was glad the foundation board was addressing its delinquent paperwork, including making its IRS form 990 available for the public to review.
“But going forward right now, the circumstances, 80% of all the funds you’ve received, more than that, that you’ve dispensed, were used for political purposes, and I believe that will jeopardize your 501C3 status if you as the board do not take the proper steps to recoup those funds,” the Pensacola legislator said.
Andrade’s warning came during a rancorous public comment portion of the meeting in which people on the chat broadcast Nazi symbols, racial slurs and  pornography. Unable to control the flow of images or sounds being shared, the foundation board agreed to recess. The board was scheduled to reconvene late Thursday.
The board posted a link on its website apologizing for the disruption and said the Department of Children and Families was “actively working with law enforcement on the incident.”
Following the abbreviated meeting, Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried called on the Department of Justice to investigate. She also urged Jack Campbell, the state attorney for the Tallahassee area, who is a Democrat, to do the same.
“I do think that it’s appropriate for Jack Campbell to start looking into some of these actions,” Fried said in a virtual press conference with reporters, adding that she had not personally spoken to him about it.

I believe that will jeopardize your 501C3 status if you as the board do not take the proper steps to recoup those funds.


– Rep. Alex Andrade


Hope Florida is an initiative launched by First Lady Casey DeSantis to help steer people off public assistance programs using state agency staff. Hope Florida Foundation is a not-for-profit direct support organization for the Department of Children and Families, which helps to administer the Hope Florida program.
Hope Florida Foundation’s finances have come under scrutiny following a Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times report that it paid $5 million apiece to two organizations that then contributed to Keep Florida Clean, a political committee that worked to defeat a proposed constitutional amendment to legalize marijuana.
The $10 million payment to the two groups mirrors the amount the Hope Florida Foundation received from health care giant Centene as part of a settlement regarding overpayment of Medicaid pharmacy benefits and services.

DeSantis: $10M payment to Hope Florida Foundation is a ‘cherry on top’

 
Gov. Ron DeSantis has cried foul, accusing the House of working with the liberal media to smear the first lady’s reputation as she potentially prepares for a gubernatorial run to replace her husband, who is being forced out of office due to term limits.
Leading the financial review in the House is Andrade, who has held two meetings over the last two weeks with high ranking Hope Florida officials and agency heads.
More Hope Florida resignations
Hope Florida Foundation president Joshua Hay kicked off Thursday’s meeting by announcing that Jake Farmer, a registered lobbyist for Walgreens Co., had resigned from the board of directors. 
Hay did not disclose when Farmer resigned and the Department of Children and Families didn’t immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for his resignation letter. Farmer did not return Florida Phoenix’s phone call asking about his resignation.
Hay announced that Wendy Nissan had been appointed to the board of directors.
The meeting was interrupted before the board could publicly discuss its IRS 990.
The form shows that two state-contracted Medicaid managed care plans that were vying for lucrative new contracts made contributions to the Hope Florida Foundation. The contracts are the largest of their kind for the state and, according to the House of Representatives, the managed care plans will be paid $143 billion over the next six years to provide health care to the state’s poor, elderly, and disabled who rely on Medicaid for their health care.
The tax form shows that the Hope Florida Foundation received contributions from Simply Healthcare Plans and Centene of $98,408 and $95,223, respectively.
The state Agency for Health Care Administration has announced plans to award new contracts in April and a second round of announcements in July. The decisions expanded statewide Simply Healthcare’s footprint in the Medicaid managed care marketplace. The new contracts contain a requirement for the plans to work with the Hope Florida program and report information about their members to Hope Florida.
The IRS 990 form doesn’t list the dates contributions were made, only the time frame.
Headline-grabbing week
The board meeting capped a week of headlines for the foundation, a direct service organization for the Department of Children and Families as well as the Hope Florida program.
Hope Florida executive director Erik Dellenback is stepping down from his post as well as his position as chair of the Florida Faith and Community Advisory Council. Dellenback’s resignation was submitted in March and takes effect in May.  
Dellenback, though, did not mention his resignation during a lengthy House budget committee meeting in which he testified along with Hay and Department of Children and Families Secretary Taylor Hatch. The resignation was first reported following the meeting.
Hay was accompanied by his own attorney at the House meeting. During his sworn testimony, Hay acknowledged that the Hope Florida Foundation had made mistakes by not filing its required paperwork. He also testified that he’s been working with Tallahassee attorney Mohammad Jazil on completing the paperwork.
Jazil, who frequently represents state agencies and advises Keep Florida Clean, was recommended to him by attorney Jeff Aaron, Hay told the House committee. Aaron is a Republican attorney who successfully defended the governor in the lawsuit filed by suspended Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren.
“Jeff Aaron connected you with Mohammad Jazil, the attorney for Keep Florida Clean, to help Hope Florida’s foundation in complying with the paperwork, to retroactively justify this payment. Is that what I am hearing right now? Members, I am sorry, I am a little flabbergasted at this revelation,” Andrade said at the meeting.

Gretchen Whitmer signs an executive directive instructing the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to analyze the ways federal cuts to Medicaid would impact Michigan. | Kyle DavidsonAs Republicans in Congress continue to eye cuts to critical programs like Medicaid in an effort to extend President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, several Michigan Democrats joined Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Royal Oak Thursday, as she signed an executive directive instructing the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to prepare a report detailing how Medicaid cuts would impact the state. 
Gathering at Corewell Health’s William Beaumont University Hospital, U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) warned that cutting funding to Medicaid could threaten access to care for some of the state’s most vulnerable residents, including children, seniors and people with disabilities. 
Dan Carey, the hospital’s president, noted that nearly 50% of all Michigan children and six out of 10 elderly adults rely on Medicaid for their health care. If these cuts pass, Carey questioned what would happen to those children, Michigan communities and the workers who care for those children. 
With the U.S. House’s budget resolution directing the House Energy and Commerce Committee to reduce the federal deficit by at least $880 billion over 10 years, Dingell, who serves on the committee, said there is no way to meet that goal without drastic cuts to Medicaid. 
  At an April 17, 2025 press conference in Royal Oak, Mich., U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) warned that Republicans would not be able to move forward with proposed spending cuts without harming Medicaid. | Kyle Davidson
“Medicaid is already a lean program. With few options for how to fill the budget hole left by cuts to Medicaid funding, states will be forced to consider cuts to coverage and benefits, leaving more people uninsured and under insured,” Dingell said.
During a presentation to the Michigan Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of Health and Human Services in March, DHHS officials noted Michigan Medicaid makes up 34% of the state’s total budget, with 70% of funding for the state’s Medicaid program coming from the federal government.
“Any cut will place an enormous financial burden on parents, older adults, people with disabilities and their families, and especially those who have already spent down their assets and resources to qualify for Medicaid,” Dingell said. “Americans would have to forgo much needed care entirely, or their family members would be forced to choose between covering their children’s expenses, saving for their own retirement, or even being able to help their loved one.”

However, there is some hope Dingell said, noting that several Republicans have publicly opposed cuts to Medicaid. 
Stevens reflected on Whitmer’s efforts serving as the state Senate minority leader, working to craft the Healthy Michigan program, a bipartisan expansion to Medicaid signed into law by then Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican. 
As Michigan hosts some of the lowest rates of uninsured individuals in the nation, it’s strange and upsetting that hosting the press conference was even necessary, Stevens said, noting that these concerns come five years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I think that we can recognize the seriousness of what this moment represents, that people deserve better, that they deserve stability and consistency and access to medical benefits,” Stevens said.

Tlaib emphasized that these cuts are not just numbers, and that every percentage cut was the life of a Michigan neighbor. 

She also pointed to the ongoing crisis in Black maternal health, with the maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black women being nearly 3.5 times the rate for non-Hispanic white women. She further noted that more than 40% of births in the U.S. are paid for by Medicaid.

“Seventy-two million people across every corner of our country rely on Medicaid. I don’t think one congressional district in our nation is not impacted. For families and seniors and people with disabilities, Medicaid is the difference between survival and suffering,” Tlaib said.
Prior to signing her directive, Whitmer said Medicaid has allowed breast cancer survivors to receive their annual mammogram and ensured more families can receive regular dental care, visit a primary care physician, and ensure their child receives emergency care rather than keeping them home due to concerns about the hospital bill.
“In short, Medicaid saves lives, it lowers costs and ensures that we have a health system that can meet all of our needs, no matter where we get our health care from,” she said.

Cuts to Medicaid would also hit small towns and rural communities hard, Whitmer said, with 37% of Michiganders in these areas receiving Medicaid coverage. 
The harm would also extend beyond individuals receiving Medicaid coverage Whitmer said, with Michigan hospitals set to lose out on half a billion in Medicaid funding annually.
“The equation is simple, fewer jobs equal weaker economies and a less healthy Michigan. Hospitals in local and rural communities across Michigan will close, which threatens care for everyone, raises prices for everyone. It forces people to drive further for health care, even in emergency situations,” Whitmer said.
“Everyone agrees that there’s always more that can be found in terms of rooting out waste or fraud. But this is not about that. This is massive, devastating slashes to core government service. This won’t make government more efficient, it’ll just raise your costs, eliminate local jobs and put lives in danger,” Whitmer said. 
By examining the impact of Medicaid cuts on the state, Michiganders can see the cost of what Republicans are hoping to accomplish in Washington, Whitmer said. 
“We’re going to send a clear message to anyone trying to trade your health and someone else’s tax cut. Medicaid is not for sale. I’ll keep fighting over the cost of health care and support access to our critical programs like Medicaid, because if you’re sick in Michigan, it shouldn’t mean going broke,” Whitmer said before signing the directive.
“Let’s all double down on our efforts to make sure that Congress and our Republican legislators in particular hear us loud and clear. This is an important moment. We can’t not fight for the people of Michigan and that’s what this is all about,” Whitmer said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0752-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 17:12:20.968408

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)The seats are installed, the naming rights awarded and the first match to be hosted in Pawtucket’s new riverfront soccer stadium is less than one month away.
But the financial future of the newly christened Centreville Bank Stadium rests on more than a fan following; accompanying residential and commercial development is considered crucial to ensuring taxpayers get a return on government-issued bonds helping pay for the sports venue.
On Thursday, Fortuitous Partners unveiled the first details of the necessary and long-awaited housing and commercial development that will flank the stadium on either side of the Pawtucket River.
The plans, via partnerships with two “prominent” real estate developers, will bring more than 600 new housing units to the area along with commercial space, creating a kind of mini city encircling the new home for the Rhode Island FC team. 
“We are incredibly proud to see this vision for the riverfront and Tidewater Landing continue to come to life,” Dan Kroeber, managing partner at Fortuitous Partners, said in a statement. “This next phase of the development will not only support the new Centreville Bank Stadium, but also create a vibrant, connected community where residents, visitors, and fans can live, work, and enjoy everything Pawtucket’s riverfront has to offer.”
Revitalizing the vacant land mixed-use development was the original vision of private developers and state and city officials when they awarded a competitive bid to Fortuitous in 2019. What is now being proposed represents a substantial departure from the original timeline and cost.

At what price?
The price tag of the residential and commercial development was not available, with Fortuitous spokesperson Lala Ismailova citing “commercially sensitive financial information” in response to questions Thursday.
“We can confirm that we’re working closely with our partners and stakeholders to ensure the project is financially sound, responsibly managed, and positioned to deliver long-term value,” Ismailova said in an email. wrote  This next phase represents a major investment in Rhode Island’s future, bringing much-needed housing, improved public amenities, and supporting the broader vision for a vibrant riverfront district.
The 10,500-seat stadium has already come in substantially over budget and past the deadline, with blame placed on inflation and supply chain disruptions. 
Rhode Island Commerce’s board of directors reluctantly agreed to shift all of the state bonds meant to fund public parking and infrastructure improvements to the stadium itself, with Gov. Dan McKee casting the tiebreaking vote in July 2022. 
“We really got suckered,” Mike McNally, a former Commerce board member who voted against the reallocation of state bonds for the project, said in an interview Thursday. “It’s like buying land and building the swimming pool but not the house.”
Borrowing costs subsequently soared. The $132 million borrowing issued in February 2024 is more than double the $59 estimate two years prior, with $89 million in interest accounting for the bulk of the costs over the 30-year repayment period. The cost features just $36 million in public tax-increment financing bonds, which assume revenue generated from the project to pay off the debt.
Revenue from the stadium alone is unlikely to generate the money needed. A 2023 financial analysis from a Commerce consultant, based on lower total borrowing costs, identified a $52 million shortfall in revenue generated from the stadium over the life of the bonds. It noted the need for additional commercial and residential development to help the city and state break even on borrowing costs.
No additional analysis based on final borrowing costs is in the works, Matt Touchette, a Commerce spokesperson, said in an interview Thursday. The state and city will start making payments on the debt service in fiscal 2027.
The city of Pawtucket has also chipped in $10 million from its unspent pandemic aid for the project, while the state awarded $10 million in tax credits, all for the stadium.

Asking for more
Despite his misgivings over how public money was used in the project, McNally welcomed the news that the stadium developer was following through on its commitment to build housing.
“That’s really what we wanted all along,” McNally said. “As long as they don’t ask for more public investment, I will be happy with that.”
As of Thursday, Fortuitous has not approached House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi seeking more financial help from the state for the housing and commercial components, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi, confirmed via email.
Pawtucket city leaders have also not discussed financing details for the housing components with Fortuitous.
“Too early in the development process,” Christopher Hunter, a city spokesperson, said in an email. 
McKee’s office did not immediately return inquiries for comment Thursday.
But Kroeber told the Providence Journal that the company is hoping for public investment on the forthcoming infrastructure upgrades, which include a riverfront connecting both banks of the river, and pedestrian walkways. He did not specify a dollar figure. 
The next phase of development begins with construction of 300 market-rate housing units on the east side of the river, directly across from the new stadium. On the west side, fronting a new stadium plaza and riverfront, will be another 250 housing units and commercial space.
Boston-based real estate development and construction company Wood Partners will lead creation of both buildings. 
Farther north, on the east side of the river, a third set of 72 mixed-income housing units will be built by a separate developer, Philadelphia-based Pennrose. Federal and state tax credits offered for low-income housing will help to pay for this component of the project, which is under review by Rhode Island Housing. The city-owned land on School Street sits directly across from the Pawtucket Portuguese Social Club. Specific income limits for the affordable and workforce housing units have not been determined.
The housing and commercial development plans are now in the design and permitting phase, Ismailova said. She did not answer when asked for an expected completion date.   
Rhode Island FC will play its first match on home turf at 4 p.m. May 3, squaring off against San Antonio FC in an already sold-out game at Centreville Bank Stadium.

She had signaled she was considering a campaign for the seat left open by incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s announcement that she would retire at the end of her term. Goodlander told the TV station she was “proud to support” Chris Pappas, the fourth-term 1st District representative, in the race. Pappas made his run official earlier this month.

Granite Staters won’t pick Shaheen’s replacement until November 2026, leaving months for the field to take shape.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)The Maine Legislature rejected a bill this week that would bring back limits on syringe services, following the recommendation of state public health experts and medical professionals.
LD 219, introduced by Rep. Anne-Marie Mastraccio (D-Sanford), would have limited the number of clean syringes that certified needle exchange programs can hand out, reverting to a one-for-one ratio that Maine required until 2022, when it adopted rules that allow participants to bring in just one used syringe to receive 100 clean ones. 
The bill sparked lengthy debate in both chambers, particularly in the light of an HIV outbreak in Penobscot County that has primarily impacted the unhoused community that uses injectable drugs. 
Several lawmakers highlighted the issue of syringe litter on roads, parks and on private property, which they blamed on the higher number of syringes people can access. 
But ultimately, the majority of legislators supported the Health and Human Services Committee’s recommendation to reject the bill, citing best practices supported by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services and other public health and harm reduction organizations.
The Senate voted 22-21 against the bill Thursday following a 76-69 House vote earlier this week.
Republican Sen. Marianne Moore, who represents Washington County and sits on the Health Committee, expressed concern about the outbreak spreading to other counties, including her district. 
Needle exchanges face municipal pushback despite state, public health backing

“Limiting access to sterile syringes now will only make it harder to prevent, protect and control spread of disease in a county already under resourced and overburdened,” she said.
“We all want cleaner streets, safer communities and less syringe litter,” she said, but if we are serious about addressing syringe waste, she encouraged her peers to increase funding for disposal kiosks and biohazard containers. “Let’s stay the course of evidence-based policy,” Moore added.
Other Republican senators disagreed. Sen. Matt Harrington of York County and Sen. Scott Cyrway of Kennebec County raised concerns about drug overdoses and “decriminalizing drug culture.” 
“This idea that these centers are somehow reducing harm to me, is ridiculous,” Harrington said, referring to certified Syringe Service Programs. “This continuous nature of enabling this behavior… is just proven to be exacerbating this issue.”
Earlier this week, several Republican representatives also criticized the bill, saying they supported the limits the bill aimed to reimpose. 
“All Mainers and their pets are at risk of a dirty needle stick,” said Rep. Ann Fredericks of Sanford.
Sanford became one of the few municipalities to bring back limits in an emergency municipal ordinance last year, which bill sponsor Mastraccio said during her testimony helped reduce syringe litter.
But according to the Maine CDC’s syringe service report from 2023, released last May, most users bring in roughly the same amount of syringes they receive. Syringe services handed out 1.16 syringes for each one they collected last year, which means that despite some concern about the state’s 100 to 1 ratio, meaning the additional needles from these programs are not driving street litter. 
Syringe service programs also provide sharps disposal containers and help reduce discarded waste in communities, according to Dr. Kinna Thakarar, a physician at Maine Medical Center and an associate professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine. 
Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor) said a rigid one-toone model doesn’t match the reality of substance use and doesn’t work.
“We have seen it in rural cities and towns alike. Public health policy must be grounded in science and best practices and lived realities of our communities,” she said. “This bill is out of step with all three.”

Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) speaks on the Senate floor in support of the ""Momnibus"" package of bills on April 17, 2025. | ScreenshotA 10-bill package to reduce racial inequities in maternal mortality in Michigan passed through the Michigan Senate Thursday, with supporters hoping that the second time will be the charm to getting the so-called “momnibus” signed into law.
The legislation, which passed with bipartisan support, had received a similar reception when it was originally introduced in April 2024, but then failed to make it across the finish line after Republican lawmakers boycotted the lame duck session in December in protest to minimum and tipped wage reforms not being placed for a vote.
The main sponsor of the package is Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor), who said the legislation incorporates a variety of approaches to improve prenatal and perinatal health outcomes in Michigan.
“By dismantling systemic barriers that disproportionately impact Black and brown birthing people, the Michigan Momnibus brings us one step closer to achieving equity and justice and reproductive and obstetric care,” Geiss told her colleagues prior to the vote. “It is a multifaceted bill package that works to improve integrity and accountability in Michigan’s maternal health care system, ensuring that every family has an equitable opportunity to have a healthy, joyful pregnancy, birthing, and postpartum experience that truly centers their needs.”



The Momnibus legislative package includes;
Senate Bill 29 mandates the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to compile annual data on racial and ethnic disparities in health care, as well as review statewide maternal deaths in order to complete a report to the legislature starting in 2026 and then continuing every three years. The department would also have to come up with a statewide plan to reduce such ethnic and racial disparities in health care.
Senate Bill 30 would enact the “Biased and Unjust Care Reporting Act” which requires the state health department to take and analyze reports of unfair treatment by pregnant or postpartum individuals who say they received improper medical care that was not culturally informed or treatment that caused them harm. The department would have to create a reporting tool to accept such complaints while also maintaining the patients’ privacy.
Senate Bill 31 bars hospital leadership from discriminating against a patient on the basis of their pregnancy or lactating status and would require a health facility to stabilize a patient or resident going through labor before ceasing care for the patient upon the patient’s refusal or denial of care. The facility would have to author a policy on patient rights and adhere to the policy.
Senate Bill 32 requires insurance companies offering medical malpractice insurance policies to provide the Department of Insurance and Financial Services with a review of the policies related to perinatal care on an annual basis.
Senate Bill 33 clarifies that a patient’s pregnancy would not preclude a designated patient advocate from making life-sustaining treatment decisions for the patient.
Senate Bill 34 clarifies Michigan’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to bar discrimination on the basis of sex, including pregnancy and lactation status. 
Senate Bill 36 amends the public health code to include eligible midwives who attended midwifery programs to participate in the state health department’s Michigan Essential Health Provider Repayment program.
Senate Bill 37 requires insurance companies that cover gynecological and pregnancy services to cover such services whether they be in a hospital or a patient’s home, by a qualified physician or nurse midwife or midwife.
Senate Bill 38 and Senate Bill 39 amends the Social Welfare Act to require the Healthy Michigan Plan to cover ultrasound procedures and fetal nonstress tests in offsite locations and permit Medicaid eligible individuals to be able to receive perinatal and gynecologic care under the Healthy Michigan Plan under certain circumstances.
 



Statistics have long corroborated disparities in maternal outcomes for women of color, with maternal mortality rates for Black women in the U.S. nearly 3.5 times the rate for non-Hispanic white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, the CDC says the rate of preterm birth among Black women is 12.34%, or about 1.5 times higher than the rate of preterm birth among white or Hispanic women, which stands at 7.64% and 8.72% respectively.
A lack of access to quality health care and educational resources are some of the reasons for the inequity, and are among the nonmedical factors that influence health outcomes. Known as the social determinants of health, the CDC says those factors include the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, worship, and age.
“Social determinants of health prevent many people from racial and ethnic minority groups from having fair opportunities for economic, physical, and emotional health,” said the CDC.
Geiss noted that the passage of the bills through the Senate came on the final day of Black Maternal Health Week.
“This has been a long road for the Michigan Momnibus, but by keeping the Momnibus moving, we can affirm a commitment to ensuring that healthy pregnancies and equitable care must transcend partisan racial, class, and economic divides, as every family deserves access to the care they need to thrive,” said Geiss.
The legislation was immediately referred to the Michigan House for consideration, where it was assigned to the Health Policy Committee.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
The man, who was arrested Wednesday after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger on his way to his job in Tallahassee, is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up, even though Leon County authorities dropped his first-degree misdemeanor charge.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,’” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
‘I can’t do anything for their brother’
The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.
The Georgia Recorder, a partner of Florida Phoenix, has submitted a public records request to obtain more information about his arrest Sunday. This is a developing story and will be updated.

(Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)A bill moving through the state Legislature to establish tax breaks for energy-hogging data centers could pose serious risks to Colorado’s climate goals, utility rates and state budget, environmental groups say.
Senate Bill 25-280 was given initial approval by the Senate Transportation and Energy Committee on a 6-3 vote, after a lengthy hearing on Wednesday. Democrats, who hold commanding majorities at the statehouse, were split on the bill, with three joining the committee’s Republicans in favor, and three opposed.
Sponsored by state Sens. Nick Hinrichsen, a Pueblo Democrat, and Paul Lundeen, a Colorado Springs Republican, the measure would create a “Data Center Development and Grid Modernization Program” in the state’s economic development office. Beginning in 2026, it would offer sales and income tax credits to incentivize investments in data centers and upgrades to electric transmission infrastructure. A nonpartisan fiscal analysis estimates the tax breaks would initially cost the state about $17 million a year.

Hinrichsen pitched data centers — sprawling server farms that power artificial intelligence models, cloud computing services and other technology — as an economic lifeline for communities like Pueblo, which faces a looming drop-off in tax revenue because of the early closure of Xcel Energy’s coal-fired Comanche Generating Station. To help the state meet its greenhouse gas emissions targets, Comanche’s final remaining 750-megawatt generating unit is now scheduled to be closed 40 years ahead of schedule in 2031, with a local tax revenue loss estimated at $25 million a year.
“We’re heading towards this cliff, and we have some significant challenges, but with data centers, we have a really, really unique opportunity,” Hinrichsen said. “We have a prime geographic location. We have the energy capacity and development capabilities to support a data center.”
States rethink data centers as ‘electricity hogs’ strain the grid

But a nationwide boom in data center construction, largely driven by investment in AI, has stoked concerns about the electricity- and water-intensive facilities’ impact on the environment, and what the surging demand for energy could do to utility rates paid by consumers. Data centers made up about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity demand in 2023, and that figure could rise to 12% by 2028, the Department of Energy estimated last year. In addition to large amounts of electricity, operators use millions of gallons of water a year to cool their equipment.
Megan Kemp, a policy advocate with environmental group EarthJustice, called SB-280 “rushed legislation” that doesn’t balance generous incentives for data center operators with protections for Colorado communities.
“(The bill) fails to provide critical safeguards for utility customers, neglects to consider impacts on communities and undermines our progress toward meeting critical climate goals,” Kemp told lawmakers.
Budget and climate impacts
The bill’s sponsors and its critics disagreed sharply during Wednesday’s hearing on the outlook for the data center industry in Colorado in the absence of new incentives.
Hinrichsen said that while he was reluctant to pass legislation that would reduce state tax revenues in the face of a serious budget crunch, he had been convinced by “hundreds of conversations over the summer and fall” that Colorado isn’t competing effectively with other states for data center investments.
“What I have heard talking to folks in my economic development community, folks at the chamber of commerce, and those in the data center development world, is, ‘It’s not going to happen in our current framework,’” he said. “This is an opportunity that we’re uniquely poised to capitalize on, that we will not capitalize on, and 100% of nothing is precisely nothing.”
But Justin Brant, utility program director at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, a Boulder-based environmental group, pointed to requests for over two gigawatts of new electricity load received by Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility.
“Data centers are coming to our state no matter what,” Brant said.
Climate advocates are especially concerned that surging data center demand could lead electricity providers to prolong the use of fossil-fuel-powered generating assets, a trend already seen in the southeastern U.S., where utilities are expanding natural gas infrastructure to meet the anticipated demand increase.
Sara Axelrod, head of public affairs at Denver-based Crusoe Energy, told lawmakers of the “cocktail of energy solutions needed to power campuses like this.” Crusoe began in 2018 as a bitcoin mining operation powered by the waste methane from oil and gas extraction — excess natural gas that’s typically vented or flared by drillers — and now uses the same power source to power AI infrastructure.
“There is no perfect, one-size-fits-all energy solution when it comes to powering these data centers, particularly as we talk about AI and the increasing scale of these data centers,” Axelrod said.
Committee members adopted five amendments to the bill on Wednesday, including a major rewrite known as “strike below” amendment, which Hinrichsen said was intended to address concerns from labor groups.
But Brant said that while the amendment did “address some of our concerns, it raises a whole host of additional ones,” including questions about geographic preferences for data center sites and the applicability of the state’s renewable energy standard.
“This bill was written by the data centers with little or no stakeholder involvement,” he said. “We’d be happy to work with them and the sponsors in the interim to get something right, but this one doesn’t do it.”
“There’s so many big things that still need to be ironed out, that I’m really concerned,” said state Sen. Lisa Cutter, an Evergreen Democrat who voted against the bill. “I think you’re trying to address some of these things. But it just seems like there’s still a lot to be discussed.”

“I think it’s been a great opportunity to talk about all the great things going on in Indiana, and to say … we’d love to have that conversation,” Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, told reporters.
  Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston answers reporter questions on Thursday, April 17, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
His House Enrolled Act 1008 would create an Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission tasked with exploring the absorption of Prairie State counties that have already voted to secede. Since 2020, 33 counties have passed such “advisory referenda,” with seven of those votes occurring in the most recent general election.
Originally, Illinois would’ve had to appoint members for the commission to convene. Now, it must meet by September — with or without Prairie State representation.
“That’s their choice whether they want to participate or not,” Huston said, shortly after the 64-23 concurrence vote.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne criticized the measure as a “publicity ploy,” and argued the secessionist counties would sink Indiana finances instead of contributing revenue.
Local prosecutors, roads
A proposal punishing public prosecutors who “categorically refuse to prosecute” criminal laws also crossed the finish line Thursday, on a 60-20 concurrence vote in the House.
House Enrolled Act 1006 initially would’ve also boosted the number of qualified special prosecutors available for appointment and offered partial reimbursement for prosecutors, defenders and more.

But those came with price tags, so the Senate stripped them out.
Now, it mainly creates a prosecutor review board that will scrutinize prosecutors and issue reports to the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council on those labeled “noncompliant.” But it no longer requires that funding be withheld.
And a complex transportation funding measure avoided negotiations — contrary to Senate expectations — when it earned a 69-19 concurrence vote in the House.
House Bill 1461 would change up the popular Community Crossings Matching Grant Program, raise the speed limit on Interstate 465, let communities tap into excess township funds and ease barriers to tolling, among numerous other provisions.
Opponents largely cited the tolling provisions as problematic, complaining about the impact to residents and local streets.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)  The Iowa Senate amended an open meetings and records bill Thursday to list security camera footage from the Iowa Capitol building as “confidential records.”
House File 706 is this year’s attempt to implement higher penalties and training requirements for Iowa’s open meetings and records laws. Fines for violating open meetings laws would increase to between $500 and $2,500 from the current range of between $100 and $500.
Knowing violations of these laws would rise to between $5,000 and $12,500; the current fine is between $1,000 and $2,500. The bill also would require that a member of a government body be removed from office if they engaged in a prior violation of open meetings laws. Additionally, newly elected and appointed public officials would have to complete a training on open records laws when they take office.
The bill passed the House unanimously in March. The measure is largely a response to alleged violations of open records laws by the city of Davenport following a six-story apartment building collapse in 2023 and alleged open meetings law violations regarding the city of Davenport reaching settlement agreements with three city employees without the city council’s approval in a public meeting.
Lawmakers also approved similar legislation in 2024, but the bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds over language added as a Senate amendment introduced by Sen. Scott Webster, R-Bettendorf, that changed the definition of a “meeting” of a government body.
Though this language is not present in the 2025 bill, Webster introduced an amendment Thursday that would add two types of information to the list of approved confidential records in Iowa Code — information obtained from security cameras operated by the legislative branch on property owned or leased by the state, and information “obtained from state employee identification card access systems” for buildings and rooms owned or leased by the state — specifically referring to the Iowa State Capitol.
Webster said this language, approved as an amendment in a 32-15 vote, would prevent people from using open records requests to find “blind spots” in Capitol security and prevent stalking or harassment of elected officials and government employees.
“If people wanted to cause this harm to the Capital building — to the people’s building — wanted to find out and go through all the camera footage to figure out where the blind spots might be in this Capitol, they could do it through an open records (request),” Webster said. “We’re eliminating that availability right now, which makes everybody in this building safer.”
Legislative staff said they are not aware of security camera footage being used to stalk or harass any lawmakers at the Statehouse.
Webster said an agreement was reached with groups like the Freedom of Information Council, the Iowa Newspaper Association and House lawmakers removing restrictions on the Iowa Department of Public Safety footage in an earlier version of the amendment, to ensure access to body camera footage would not be impacted.
But Democrats said the measure would prevent Iowans from accessing public information. Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said that Iowans, as taxpayers, are paying for lawmakers’ and public workers’ time at the Iowa State Capitol, and should be able to access footage as requested.
“They’re paying the bill to run the camera,” Petersen said. “They’re paying the bill for this beautiful building. Why would we take public access away from them — in an open meetings bill no less? You want to take away public access and say it’s because of security — no it’s not.”
Webster said security camera footage could still be accessed through subpoenas — court orders to provide information or records — in cases where a person commits a crime in the Capitol building.
Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, said the potential use of subpoenas to access these records was an “excuse” to obscure the limit being put on public access to what happens at the Capitol.
“The average citizen doesn’t have access to getting a subpoena, and shouldn’t need that access in that manner,” Quirmbach said. “The bill, as it has been amended, restricts the public access. It is not something that this Legislature should endorse.”

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Federal education dollars are now at risk thanks to President Donald Trump’s dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education, which could significantly hurt Minnesota public school districts — the majority of which receive at least 10% of their budgets from the feds, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.
Tribal nations within Minnesota’s borders would be even more impacted, as a larger share of their budgets comes from the feds. The Red Lake Public School District received nearly 40% of its revenue from federal funding in fiscal year 2022, according to EPI.
The Trump administration promised that closing the department won’t result in cutting federal funds, but the people who are responsible for determining whether schools qualify for a grant could soon be let go, risking the reliability of the funds.
Republicans in Congress are also desperate to find cuts to pay for more border defense, Pentagon spending and tax cuts and proposed significant cuts to federal education spending as recently as 2023. 
School districts receive the majority of their funding from the state and local governments, but the federal government plays a large role in assisting K-12 schools in low-income communities through Title 1 funding. The EPI study found that in most cases, federal funds make up less than 20% of a district’s budget. But, many districts rely far more heavily on the federal government, particularly in southern states, where some districts receive 70% of their revenue from the feds.

Many northern Minnesota school districts in and around tribal nations receive significant federal funds, as they are low-income areas. Cass Lake-Bena Public Schools, Mahnomen Public School District and Waubun-Ogema-White Earth Schools received about 30% of their district revenue from the feds in fiscal year 2022, according to the EPI analysis.
St. Paul Public School District received $176 million from the federal government in the same year, which accounts for 21% of its total revenue. Minneapolis Public Schools received $145 million, about 19% of its total revenue.
School districts across Minnesota and in the Twin Cities metro are facing severe budget shortfalls and have drawn down reserves to fill the gaps. The end of one-time pandemic aid, inflation and declining enrollment are major contributors to school districts’ tight budgets.
A cut to federal funding, even those schools that receive about 10% of federal funds, would require districts to lay off teachers and staff and make other difficult budget decisions. Or, they will go to voters in their districts and ask them to approve a property tax hike.
In addition to Title 1, the feds provide money for the IDEA program for special education students.
The Trump administration has threatened to withhold billions of these federal dollars to states that don’t capitulate to its demand that they end the use of diversity programs in public schools. 
Title 1 funds have been withheld from school districts at least once in recent history — to incentivize districts to desegregate.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-05-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 16:12:10.677330

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
The man, who was arrested Wednesday after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger on his way to his job in Tallahassee, is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up, even though Leon County authorities dropped his first-degree misdemeanor charge.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,’” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
 ‘I can’t do anything for their brother’

The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.

(Courtesy of Ewing campaign)OMAHA — Douglas County Treasurer John Ewing spent Omaha’s first general election debate Thursday framing his pitch for voters to retire three-term Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert and hire him.
His core argument: Omaha and its dynamic business community and neighborhoods are growing in spite of stale city leadership but would grow faster under his collaborative approach.
“I will get things done for the people of this community … and if you like what I’ve done as Douglas County Treasurer, you’re going to love what I’m going to do as your next mayor,” he said.
Stothert, seeking a modern-record fourth term, spent most of the Omaha Press Club and League of Women Voters debate touting the city’s performance in her nearly dozen years as mayor. The debate was moderated by WOWT anchor Brian Mastre.
Parks and urban core
She said the city, with help from private donors and developers, is purposefully rebuilding the urban core’s parks and public spaces to make the city more interesting and appealing.

“We need steady leadership,” she said. “We need initiative. We need commitment to continue this great momentum. We have to build a stronger city for tomorrow.”
Both candidates agreed that Omaha has grown as a destination for young professionals but disagreed over whether City Hall has been a help or a hindrance in that progress.
Ewing said the local private donors and developers he speaks with say they are working around a lack of trust with the city to build and maintain new parks and event facilities.
“We have that new park for a reason, and that is because the city neglected the former Gene Leahy Mall and did not take care of that facility properly,” Ewing said.
Stothert disagreed, saying no donors would invest millions of dollars in downtown Omaha without trusting the leadership of the city. She said business leaders like the track the city is on.
“What my opponent just said is absolutely false,” Stothert said. “It’s not a lack of trust that the private sector and the philanthropists would put in $400 million for a park.”
Public safety and streetcar
Ewing, a former deputy chief at the Omaha Police Department, said his former co-workers were performing well despite being short more than 100 people. He said he would help them recruit.
“I have the skill set to help them be able to recruit police officers and get to full staffing so that they can really focus on community policing and building relationships,” he said.

Stothert said Ewing and critics of the pace of police hiring don’t understand the negative impact that protests after George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis had on interest in police careers.
She dismissed Ewing’s criticism of the city’s public safety approach, pointing to crime stats she said show improvement. She credited police for working with community leaders.
“We will always be 5% higher [in pay] than any law enforcement agency in the state of Nebraska, and I feel like that will stop this cycle of everybody trying to catch up,” she said.
The two candidates largely agreed on the best path forward for the streetcar, saying they would like to eventually see plans that expand the route north and south to more of the city.
Ewing took a jab at Stothert for not letting the people vote on the project but has said the project is too far along to stop. He said Omaha needed to maximize development along the route.
“We have to ensure that it’s going to be the best possible use of our resources in this community as possible,” he said.
Stothert defended not going to a vote because the project did not raise taxes on Omaha residents and instead relies on a state-created incentive known as tax-increment financing.
She said it would spur more than $4 billion in private investment along the route from midtown Omaha’s University of Nebraska Medical Center to Mutual of Omaha’s downtown campus.
“It is a catalyst for economic development,” she said.
Traffic cameras, immigration and DEI
Both candidates also agreed on the positive impact of diversity and immigration on Omaha. Stothert and Ewing defended the city having a diversity, equity and inclusion officer.

One brief but interesting disagreement: traffic cameras. Ewing said he supported them for traffic infraction enforcement, while Stothert questioned their reliability and effectiveness.
Stothert won the five-way April primary with 27,245 votes. Ewing finished second with 24,605. The remaining candidates, including former State Sen. Mike McDonnell, earned 23,358 votes.
She said she would continue to focus her message on the priorities she said the people have prioritized: public safety, lower taxes and economic development.
“We work really, really hard, and we don’t take anything for granted,” she said, adding that she earned a higher percentage of the primary vote than she had in her first race.
Ewing said he saw something different in the numbers from April: voter fatigue with the mayor. Repeating his stump speech, he said the people of Omaha are ready for a change.
“What I learned from the primary is that 65% of the voters wanted a new mayor,” Ewing said. He later added: “The most important thing an elected leader can do is be responsive.”
Said Stothert: “Cities never stand still. They are either moving forward and growing or they are declining and falling behind. I want to keep Omaha moving forward.”

Josh Shapiro’s official residence early Sunday morning. (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI to open a full investigation into the firebombing of Gov. Josh Shapiro’s official residence and whether it constitutes a federal hate crime.
Shapiro, his family and guests were awakened and evacuated safely from the Harrisburg residence early Sunday morning after a fire broke out in a public part of the building. Hours earlier, Shapiro, who is Jewish, hosted Passover Seder in the state dining room, which was heavily damaged in the attack.
“Given the deeply troubling allegations that the suspect targeted Governor Shapiro based in part on his religious identity, the April 13 incident warrants immediate and serious federal scrutiny,” Schumer said in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
At an event in Harrisburg thanking firefighters Thursday, Shapiro reiterated that he would not weigh in on what the charges should be.
“Let me be very clear, I have total and complete confidence in (Dauphin County) District Attorney Fran Chardo to charge this case as he sees fit, to analyze the evidence, to apply the law and to see the case through,” Shapiro said.
Shapiro said he placed his trust in Chardo’s judgment and that he would respect the Department of Justice’s decision whether to bring federal charges.
“As to Senator Schumer or anybody else, I don’t think it’s helpful for people on the outside who haven’t seen the evidence, who don’t know what occurred, who are applying their own viewpoints to the situation to weigh in, in that manner,” he said.
Authorities quickly concluded the fire was intentionally set. A Harrisburg man who turned himself in to state police later in the day confessed to using Molotov cocktails to start the blaze. He also said he planned to beat Shapiro with a hammer he carried if he encountered the governor  inside the residence.

Cody Balmer, 38, has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault, burglary and related offenses. He was held without bail in Dauphin County Jail after a hearing Monday.
In an interview with investigators, Balmer said that he felt hatred toward Shapiro. Search warrants for Balmer’s electronic devices and writings released Wednesday revealed he made references to Shapiro and Palestine in a 911 call shortly after the fire when he also made a confession.
“The suspect told 911 operators that Governor Shapiro needs to know the suspect ‘will not take part in [Shapiro’s] plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people’ and referenced ‘our people’ being harmed by ‘that monster,’ Schumer’s letter says.
“These statements — in conjunction with the timing of the attack during Passover, Governor Shapiro’s visible embrace of his Jewish faith, and the context of rising antisemitism globally and across the country — raise serious concerns about antisemitic motivation,” the letter says.

Shapiro said Bondi was among dozens of officials, former governors and others who offered support and prayers on Sunday. Bondi said in a press briefing Wednesday that she and FBI director Kash Patel spoke with Shapiro after the attack.
She said Wednesday that she firmly believed the attack was intended to kill Shapiro and pledged to work with state authorities to do “anything we can to help convict the person that did this and keep them behind bars as long as possible.”
Pennsylvania law provides prosecutors the option of adding an “ethnic intimidation” charge when a person commits an underlying offense such as assault, harassment, stalking and other crimes motivated by hatred toward the race, color, religion or national origin of a person or group.
The charge enhances the severity of the offense, which can lead to tougher penalties. If an offense such as assault is graded as a second-degree felony, the ethnic intimidation charge becomes a first-degree felony with a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.
The Justice Department enforces a number of laws covering crimes based on race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability. These include damage to religious property and violent interference with federal protected activities.
The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act covers attempted homicide and carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Americans are watching as the new presidential administration dangerously hacks away at institutions of our federal government at the expense of the people, with a slew of executive orders that violate the Constitution and aim to strip Americans of cherished civil liberties they have known for generations.
We can no longer rely on Congress as a backstop. The Trump administration has ordered the Department of Justice to cease all involvement in civil rights cases, including enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), which has protected Americans’ right to vote since the civil rights era.
Congress has refused to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and is responsible for continuing to renew the VRA, and federal courts have been slowly eroding federal voting rights protections for years. The Supreme Court has notoriously ruled against landmark provisions of the VRA, like the 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision and the 2021 Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee decision.
Yet, in this time of uncertainty and national instability, Colorado can act on its own to strengthen the right to vote for Coloradans.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate Bill 25-1, the Colorado Voting Rights Act, will protect the access to the ballot Colorado voters currently have while protecting the state from the dismantling of the federal Voting Rights Act, any federal or state administration changes, and future attempts to undermine fair and accessible elections, regardless of who controls Congress or the White House.
And it’s not just democracy advocates who support this move — two-thirds of Coloradans agree. A new poll from the State Innovation Exchange found that voters support a Colorado Voting Rights Act by a wide margin of 61%, with 46% supporting it strongly, more than all of those who oppose it combined.
Coloradans from all walks of life support the Colorado Voting Rights Act and see it as a policy that protects all communities, not just some, garnering an additional stamp of approval from 64% of centrist voters, and 62% of independent voters.
Despite all the strides Colorado has made in breaking down barriers to voter participation, we still have one of the widest racial turnout gaps in the nation. The COVRA addresses this while codifying anti-discrimination protections into state law.
Specifically, the COVRA will help build a more equitable democracy by setting clear and fair standards to ensure election administrators employ practices that do not create systemic disparities in participation between communities. The COVRA also prohibits election methods that dilute the vote of communities of color, targeting classic cases of gerrymandering that result in communities being underrepresented.
All local jurisdictions in Colorado are already subject to anti-discrimination standards under the federal VRA. Unlike the federal VRA, the COVRA is designed to help resolve disagreements over election rules outside of court whenever possible. Local governments would remain free to continue running their elections independently and according to their own rules and practices; the new bill simply sets standards in state law to prevent and address discriminatory practices.
Additionally, the bill creates explicit protections for LGBTQ+ voters, voters with disabilities, and eligible voters who are confined in jail during an election so that every Coloradan with the right to vote is protected under state law.
Colorado must take decisive action to protect our civil rights and liberties before it is too late. Our attorney general currently lacks the authority to enforce the VRA, and we need to equip our state to defend voting rights if federal protections fall.
Democracy includes everyone — no matter their race, background, ZIP code, or income — and every single eligible Coloradan deserves to fairly cast a ballot.
The Colorado Voting Rights Act will ensure that every voter’s voice is protected in future elections, no matter who is in charge.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
The man, who was arrested Wednesday after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger on his way to his job in Tallahassee, is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up, even though Leon County authorities dropped his first-degree misdemeanor charge.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,'” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
‘I can’t so anything for their brother’
The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.
The Georgia Recorder, a partner of Florida Phoenix, has submitted a public records request to obtain more information about his arrest Sunday. This is a developing story and will be updated.

Josh Shapiro’s official residence and whether it constitutes a federal hate crime.
Shapiro, his family and guests were awakened and evacuated safely from the Harrisburg residence early Sunday morning after a fire broke out in a public part of the building. Hours earlier, Shapiro, who is Jewish, hosted Passover Seder in the state dining room, which was heavily damaged in the attack.
“Given the deeply troubling allegations that the suspect targeted Governor Shapiro based in part on his religious identity, the April 13 incident warrants immediate and serious federal scrutiny,” Schumer said in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
At an event in Harrisburg thanking firefighters Thursday, Shapiro reiterated that he would not weigh in on what the charges should be.
“Let me be very clear, I have total and complete confidence in (Dauphin County) District Attorney Fran Chardo to charge this case as he sees fit, to analyze the evidence, to apply the law and to see the case through,” Shapiro said.
Shapiro said he placed his trust in Chardo’s judgment and that he would respect the Department of Justice’s decision whether to bring federal charges.
“As to Senator Schumer or anybody else, I don’t think it’s helpful for people on the outside who haven’t seen the evidence, who don’t know what occurred, who are applying their own viewpoints to the situation to weigh in, in that manner,” he said.
Authorities quickly concluded the fire was intentionally set. A Harrisburg man who turned himself in to state police later in the day confessed to using Molotov cocktails to start the blaze. He also said he planned to beat Shapiro with a hammer he carried if he encountered the governor  inside the residence.

Cody Balmer, 38, has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault, burglary and related offenses. He was held without bail in Dauphin County Jail after a hearing Monday.
In an interview with investigators, Balmer said that he felt hatred toward Shapiro. Search warrants for Balmer’s electronic devices and writings released Wednesday revealed he made references to Shapiro and Palestine in a 911 call shortly after the fire when he also made a confession.
“The suspect told 911 operators that Governor Shapiro needs to know the suspect ‘will not take part in [Shapiro’s] plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people’ and referenced ‘our people’ being harmed by ‘that monster,’ Schumer’s letter says.
“These statements — in conjunction with the timing of the attack during Passover, Governor Shapiro’s visible embrace of his Jewish faith, and the context of rising antisemitism globally and across the country — raise serious concerns about antisemitic motivation,” the letter says.

Shapiro said Bondi was among dozens of officials, former governors and others who offered support and prayers on Sunday. Bondi said in a press briefing Wednesday that she and FBI director Kash Patel spoke with Shapiro after the attack.
She said Wednesday that she firmly believed the attack was intended to kill Shapiro and pledged to work with state authorities to do “anything we can to help convict the person that did this and keep them behind bars as long as possible.” 
Pennsylvania law provides prosecutors the option of adding an “ethnic intimidation” charge when a person commits an underlying offense such as assault, harassment, stalking and other crimes motivated by hatred toward the race, color, religion or national origin of a person or group. 
The charge enhances the severity of the offense, which can lead to tougher penalties. If an offense such as assault is graded as a second-degree felony, the ethnic intimidation charge becomes a first-degree felony with a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.
The Justice Department enforces a number of laws covering crimes based on race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability. These include damage to religious property and violent interference with federal protected activities. 
The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act covers attempted homicide and carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Free.,Federal appeals court temporarily freezes multibillion-dollar Biden climate fund,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-appeals-court-temporarily-freezes-multibillion-dollar-biden-climate-fund,,"WASHINGTON — The legal battle over a Biden-era climate program ramped up late Wednesday when an appeals court halted a federal judge’s ruling requiring the disbursement of those funds.The ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will keep funds frozen in Citibank accounts while a federal suit over the program is ongoing.The appeals court order reversed a preliminary injunction that U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan of the District of Columbia issued Tuesday that temporarily barred the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from “unlawfully suspending or terminating” grant awards.The appeals panel said it had not had access to Chutkan’s opinion explaining her order granting an injunction — which came a day after the order itself — and the trial judge had therefore not met the high bar needed to issue a preliminary injunction. The panel’s order “should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits,” the judges said.“The purpose of this order is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the district court’s forthcoming opinion in support of its order granting a preliminary injunction together with” the government’s appeal, the judges wrote.Chutkan issued her opinion the day after granting the preliminary injunction, pointing out that “for weeks, despite repeated inquiries to Citibank and EPA, Plaintiffs received little to no communication from EPA or Citibank regarding their inability to access their funds.”“Overnight, billions of dollars appropriated by Congress were frozen. As a result, nationwide projects were halted, workplans were disrupted, and millions of dollars in approved transactions with committed partners could not be disbursed,” she wrote.Fight over fundingClimate United Fund and other organizations sued President Donald Trump’s administration and Citibank in March over money frozen in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.The $27 billion initiative, which provides funding to organizations building for energy-efficient projects and other measures to tackle climate change, was authorized by Congress as part of the Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats passed along party lines and President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022.Chutkan’s order blocked the administration from “directly or indirectly impeding” Citibank or causing the bank to “deny, obstruct, delay, or otherwise limit access to funds in accounts established in connection with” the organizations’ grants.The Trump administration quickly challenged that ruling Wednesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.The higher court temporarily blocked Chutkan’s decision “pending further order.”The appeals court’s ruling halts Chutkan’s preliminary injunction to the extent that it “enables or requires Citibank to release, disburse, transfer, otherwise move, or allow access to funds.”The higher court also prevented the Trump administration from having to file a status report with the district court within 24 hours of the preliminary injunction’s entry that confirmed their compliance, as outlined in Chutkan’s ruling.The appeals court also ordered that “no party take any action, directly or indirectly, with regard to the disputed contracts, grants, awards or funds.”The EPA said in March it would be terminating $20 billion in grants under the program, and the agency’s administrator Lee Zeldin described the climate initiative as a “gold bar” scheme.Climate United Fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday, and the EPA declined to comment.",,,,2025-04-17 15:10:45.240723

(Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries)This story was originally published by The Appeal.
As U.S. homelessness rates reach record highs, President Donald Trump has pledged to ban street camping, relocate unhoused people to privately-managed “tent cities,” and arrest anyone caught violating the new laws.
But while Trump’s threats certainly sound draconian, they’re not exactly novel. In recent years, several states have organized increasingly harsh homeless sweeps — perhaps most typified by Louisiana, where the governor recently oversaw a possible model for the sort of mass relocation that Trump has promised.
Federal officials seem to be taking note. According to a local official who spoke to The Appeal, in early February, Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem quietly visited a warehouse where Gov. Jeff Landry had relocated nearly 200 homeless people, sometimes under threat of arrest. And in March, Trump appointed Madison Sheahan, a state official whose agency enforced Landry’s crackdown, to become deputy director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for comment.
Sheahan, who is 28, was appointed secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) by Landry in 2023, though she had no background in conservation or ecology. She previously worked on Noem’s campaign for South Dakota governor and was executive director of the Republican Party there, where she worked on banning trans athletes from college sports. Otherwise, her qualifications are questionable: besides issuing rules for sawfish harvesting and letting military veterans hunt bears, Sheahan’s most relevant experience over the last year seems to be lending her officers to Landry to round up homeless residents.

 
Attorneys for the unhoused have now filed a class action suit against the state — including Sheahan’s LDWF — to block Landry’s crackdown. As the case unfolds in New Orleans’ civil district court, Louisiana’s situation could serve as a bellwether for how Trump 2.0 will address unsheltered homelessness—and even the detention of migrants.
Jesse Rabinowitz, communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center, called Sheahan’s promotion “really concerning.” He added that what’s happening in New Orleans is “a real-life example of what could happen on a larger scale.”
The sweeps by Louisiana state agencies are part of “how conservative electives can punish people living in more progressive parts of the state,” warned Rabinowitz. “They did it with migrants, and they’ve said they’re going to do it with homeless folks. And we have to believe them.”

Louisiana’s crackdown began during singer Taylor Swift’s October tour dates in New Orleans. In the days leading up to the concerts, Landry directed Louisiana State Police (LSP) and LDWF officers to “sweep” downtown encampments of hundreds of unhoused people, pushing them all into one designated area a few blocks away. The sweeps drew national attention.
City council members and Mayor LaToya Cantrell condemned Landry’s actions. One council member’s chief of staff later said in an affidavit that, when she visited the government-run encampment, “one gentleman asked me where he could get a tent,” because state officers had thrown his away.
As a result, she said, “he got bitten by rats the night before because he did not have a tent to go inside.”
Lawyers representing unhoused people swiftly sued. But the ensuing court battle took a worrying turn in January, when the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that cities cannot abridge the state’s police power. LSP can now conduct sweeps without following city ordinances, meaning they don’t have to provide sufficient warning beforehand. That ruling could signal to other red states that courts will let them send state agencies into blue cities, such as Austin or Nashville, and ignore any municipal-level protections in place.
A week after that ruling, LSP and DWF officers again descended on downtown New Orleans’ encampments. This time, they sent more than 100 people to a warehouse seven miles away called the “Transition Center.” Attorneys for the unhoused demanded another restraining order, but courts denied the request.
“Governor Landry’s interest in moving the encampments was to provide warm shelter and a place for the unhoused to be secure from potential harm during the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras,” a judge wrote.


The Transition Center sat in a former packaging warehouse alongside New Orleans’ industrial canal. While the press was not allowed in, photos shared from within the Center show rows of cots separated by black cloths, and some couches facing a television, in a warehouse with no eye-level windows. Residents reportedly received three meals daily and could leave freely, though neither a bus stop nor sidewalk sits near the site. Access was restricted to those with authorization.
Several service organizations worked in the warehouse. After initial difficulties, some employees say the remaining residents were satisfied with conditions. A medical worker told The Appeal he appreciated seeing patients consistently, and “we were able to get people healthier than when they arrived.”
Now that those events have finished, the warehouse has closed.

After the initial October sweeps, a judge ordered LSP and LDWF to “not destroy or dispose of the property of unhoused people without judicial process” and to provide notice of sweeps as set out in New Orleans’ municipal ordinances.
But the New Year’s Day truck attack that killed 14 people in New Orleans, including a sleeping unhoused person, seems to have changed the calculus. Within hours, Landry issued an executive ordergiving him emergency powers to “direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population, from any stricken or threatened area.” The following week, the Louisiana Supreme Court dissolved the preliminary injunction. One justice wrote that, in the wake of the Jan. 1 attack, the sweeps were “about public safety.”
Court affidavits show how the case has already emboldened police to criminalize people experiencing homelessness.
According to the lawsuit, 12 LDWF officers and “five or six” LSP troopers approached 32-year-old plaintiff Raymond Scott when the major sweeps began in January. Scott is unhoused and has already lost valuables during sweeps. Last summer, a city worker reached into his tent and took a treasured owl figurine Scott inherited from his great-grandmother, then disposed of it even as Scott “begged them not to take it,” according to a court affidavit he later filed.
“You have two choices,” a trooper said. “Come willingly, or we cuff you, detain you, and bring you to the Transition Center.”
Scott said he didn’t want to go.
“You know you can be arrested for being homeless now?” a trooper allegedly replied. Scott then said he wanted to call his lawyer.
Scott’s attorneys argue that the US Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling in Grants Pass v. Johnson does not permit Landry’s sweeps, since Grants Pass concerned whether arresting people for sleeping outside violates the 8th Amendment’s protections against cruel and unusual punishments. In this case, the attorneys allege Louisiana violated unhoused residents’ 4th and 14th Amendment rights.
Another resident, Michael Garner, asserts in the suit that seven or eight LSP troopers approached his camp and told him to pack up. When he asked if he could leave, a trooper said he was being detained.
“The troopers told me that I would not be free to leave until I was brought to the Transition Center,” Garner wrote. He says he packed everything he owned into a box and got on the bus. When he later tried to fetch his belongings — including his social security card, birth certificate, and a bicycle —“officials told me that they could not find the box.”
Last week, attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the suit voluntarily. The legal team declined to comment on that request, as the motion is pending.
Sheahan, who’s set to begin her role at ICE in the coming weeks, ran the LDWF when its officers conducted the sweeps. In a March 11 Fraternal Order of Police statement celebrating her promotion, Patrick Yoes, National President of the FOP, celebrated that she’d “established a Special Operations Group within the enforcement division” for events like the Super Bowl. According to a November Facebook post, state police officers trained LDWF’s new special-ops team. Sheahan also joined Landry and DHS Secretary Noem for a briefing on Super Bowl security measures when Noem visited in February.
LDWF agents typically enforce hunting, fishing, and boating regulations. An LDWF spokesperson did not answer questions about why the agency took part in homeless sweeps.

 
Advocates have decried the sweeps and “transition center” as both cruel and ineffective. But at the state level, officials have celebrated their success.
“We think this is absolutely going to be looked at as a success, because we were able to get people out of harm’s way just weeks after a terror attack in that same area,” a spokesperson for the Louisiana Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (GOHSEP) told The Appeal. The state closed the Transition Center on March 21.


The spokesperson said that, from a peak of 183 people, 108, or about 60 percent, received permanent housing by the time the center closed.
An additional 59 people left on their own, while 15 others moved into a different shelter downtown. The center’s final costs could exceed $17.5 million.
But some housing advocates say the sweeps undermined the city-level housing efforts that have been ongoing since 2023. Those programs have housed more than 822 people at a much lower cost per person. Critics also say the warehouse sweeps disrupted contact between unhoused people and their case workers and service providers. The National Homelessness Law Center’s Rabinowitz stressed that the only real fix is affordable housing.
“There’s consensus that housing solves homelessness, and throwing people in jail and forcing homeless people into camps is not the solution,” he said. “But the people that are put in charge don’t seem to be motivated by helping people. They seem to be motivated by this desire to police and punish people for struggling in a country where a lot of people are struggling to make ends meet.”

A philosopher with more than two decades in academic leadership roles is the next provost and vice president of academic affairs for Rhode Island College (RIC)
Manyul Im will leave his current position as provost and vice president at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut for his new role starting July 1. He will be RIC’s first permanent provost in roughly three years.
Im will replace Sheila Flemming, who has served as RIC’s interim provost since September 2024. Flemming, who did not apply for the permanent position, came on board after the departure of Carolynn Masters, who served since 2022 as interim provost. Masters was appointed after the departure of Helen Tate, who was named provost in 2020. 
In higher education, provosts typically typically serve as chief academic officers and oversee the entirety of a school’s academic affairs, faculty, curriculum development and approval, and academic support for students.
The Council on Postsecondary Education, which oversees public higher ed in Rhode Island, approved Im’s appointment Wednesday night. RIC announced the appointment in an email to the campus community Thursday.
“I entered academia because of the opportunity it gave me as a first-generation college student to go beyond the dreams of professional, economic success that my immigrant parents had for me,” Im said in a statement. “I wanted to discover the foundations for a meaningful life and try to contribute something to the lives of others.” 
“I have sought out institutions of higher education where there were strong commitments to academic quality and mission-driven efforts to provide diversity and inclusivity support, professional curricular content, as well as an intellectual life of the mind in a global context,” Im continued.
Im has a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley. His master’s and doctorate degrees in philosophy come from the University of Michigan. Im’s research focus lies in the wide and storied range of Chinese philosophy, plus the ancient Greeks, the history of western philosophy and ethics. Since 2009, Im co-publishes a blog called Warp Weft and Way, which looks at Chinese philosophy in a comparative light. 
Im graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s professional development program in 2016, according to his LinkedIn.
Im has worked in different roles at Bridgeport since 2014, including dean of arts and sciences and associate provost. During his tenure, Im led academic efforts to bolster the schools’ health sciences, human services, and nursing offerings, and he helped launch a professional development initiative for faculty, the Universal Design for Learning. Additionally, he helped tailor a recruitment strategy for international students, and oversaw the creation of the Heckman Center for student support and career development. 
Prior to Bridgeport, Im worked in leadership and as faculty at Fairfield University, California State University, Los Angeles, and the University of Oklahoma. As a professor at these schools, Im taught a range of courses from intro-level philosophy to Confucianism, Daosim, and seminars on broader topics like ethics, free will and human destiny.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-17 18:49:01+00:00,CT Mirror,CT Senate leaders offer new plan to tax rich to mitigate federal cuts,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/17/ct-income-tax-hikes-on-rich/,"Boosting the two highest marginal rates on the CT income tax would affect couples earning more than $500,000 and singles over $250,000.","The state Senate’s leaders unveiled a new proposal Thursday to boost taxes on Connecticut’s high earners, seeking to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to mitigate anticipated deep cuts in federal aid to health care, education and other core programs here.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, in a joint statement with Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, recommended boosting the two highest marginal rates on the state income tax, which would generate revenue from single filers earning more than $250,000 per year and couples topping $500,000. 
The state income tax has seven different rates, taxing various portions of household income between 2% to 6.99%. Most middle-class income is taxed between 4.5% and 6%.
Looney and Duff’s plan would boost the tax rate from:

6.9% to 7.5% for all earnings between $250,000 and $500,000 by single filers, and between $500,000 and $1 million by married couples.
6.99% to 7.99% for all earnings greater than $500,000 by single filers and above $1 million by married couples.

Though the state Senate Democratic leadership office hadn’t completed projections on the full revenue impact early Thursday afternoon, it estimated boosting the 6.99% rate to 7.99% would generate more than $420 million per year.
The Democratic leaders say these higher rates would be offered if the Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald J. Trump follow through on plans to extend 2017 federal income tax cuts set to expire after this year, a move that would chiefly benefit households making more than $320,000 annually. 
To pay for that tax relief, Congress is eyeing $880 billion in federal budget cuts, a move that likely would cost state and municipal government here more than $1 billion in federal aid for Medicaid, special education, food stamps, higher education research grants, and other programs.
“In. the wake of yet another federal tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest Americans, Connecticut cannot afford to fail to take action at a time of crisis,” Looney said. “If Washington insists on handing billionaires another tax break, we will ensure some of that windfall comes back to the people of Connecticut to help deal with the massive federal cuts we anticipate.”
Duff added “this is a proactive, conditional measure that protects core services, invests in education and infrastructure, and maintains a level playing field.”
Looney and Duff’s comments come a few days after dozens of progressives in the General Assembly appealed for state tax hikes on the wealthy to help offset likely deeper cuts in federal aid to Connecticut.
But despite those sentiments, it remained unclear Thursday whether Connecticut would break from a recent trend and consider any tax hikes aimed solely at high-earners.
Gov. Ned Lamont has consistently blocked any effort to raise taxes on the wealthy since he took office in 2019, backed by other fiscally moderate Democrats and minority Republicans in the state House and Senate.
And Lamont, who says boosting state taxes on the rich would prompt them to flee Connecticut, has said it’s premature to discuss raising levies on them now before the federal budget picture has been resolved.
This marks the fifth consecutive year that Looney has introduced bills to boost income tax rates on the capital gains earnings of rich households, and to create a so-called “mansion tax” — a statewide property levy on high-value homes. But legislative leaders have never included these proposals once in the final budget package negotiated with Lamont.
“Despite the unpredictability coming out of Washington, the [Lamont] administration is having ongoing discussions with legislative leadership about a path forward, after we see a final federal budget and know its impact on Connecticut,” Chris Collibee, the governor’s budget spokesman, said Thursday. “Especially in light of recent economic concerns, his preference is increasing the number of taxpayers in our state, rather than increasing taxes.”
Republicans in the General Assembly also are pressing Lamont to avoid raising state taxes. The first step toward responding to any cuts from Washington, they say, is to look for options to trim spending at the state level.
“Democrats worship at the altar of government spending,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who said neither Democratic legislators nor Lamont have responded seriously to recent instances of inefficiency or malfeasance.
Candelora noted that public colleges and universities here entered the fiscal year holding more than $1 billion in reserves, even as they appealed to legislators for more state funding. The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, which includes community colleges and regional state universities, held more than $610 million of those stockpiled funds.
The GOP leader also cited a recent report from the state auditors showing state officials mismanaged audits for Connecticut’s school construction program in recent years and failed to enforce price caps that are meant to hold down costs for local school building projects.
“Not only do they [Democrats] not care about the stockpiling and hoarding of money, they also don’t care about the criminal misuse of money,” Candelora added.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-6.25.58-PM.png,,,2025-04-17 15:10:45.240723

The Milford Museum will continue its American History Series on Saturday, May 10, with a deep dive into one of the region’s most important agricultural legacies: the canning industry.
The presentation, led by agricultural historian and former Delaware Secretary of Agriculture Ed Kee, will take place at 1:00 p.m. at the Milford Public Library.
For more than a century, the Delmarva Peninsula and Baltimore were at the heart of the nation’s canned food industry. From the 1840s through the 1940s, canneries dotted the landscape, transforming the area into a major hub of food processing.

By the end of the 19th century, Maryland boasted more than 387 canneries, while Delaware had 49—growing to 111 by 1919. At its peak, Delaware’s canning industry employed over 1,800 workers.
Locally, Milford was home to as many as eight canneries operating well into the 1960s.
Other towns like Frederica, Harrington, Bridgeville, Lincoln City, and Milton also played a role, with most canneries specializing in tomatoes. Nearly every town in Kent and Sussex Counties hosted a facility.
However, as competition from states like California increased, the industry began to decline.
Today, four vegetable processing firms still operate in the region—two in Delaware, one in New Jersey, and one in Maryland—processing crops like peas, lima beans, and sweet corn. Of the four, three are now freezing operations, and just one continues canning.
Ed Kee
Ed Kee brings a wealth of experience and scholarship to the discussion.
With a career that includes three decades at the University of Delaware Cooperative Extension and two terms as Delaware’s Secretary of Agriculture, Kee has authored more than 30 scholarly articles and five books on agricultural history.
He was instrumental in founding LEAD Delaware and helped create the Delaware Young Farmers Program, which offers 0% interest loans to beginning farmers.
The event is free and open to the public. It is part of a monthly series sponsored by the Milford Museum and funded by the Delaware Heritage Commission. Each program focuses on topics in local, state, or national history and is held on the second Saturday of the month at the Milford Public Library, located at 11 S.E.

(Spalding University photo)Kathleen Driskell of Oldham County will be Kentucky’s new poet laureate, succeeding novelist and essayist Silas House.
In naming Driskell Thursday, Gov. Andy Beshear said she has “made a real impact on the commonwealth’s rich literary community through her poetry and passion for teaching.” 
Driskell, the author of multiple books of poetry, has been honored with  the Appalachian Review’s Denny C. Plattner Award in Creative Nonfiction. She has received grants from the Kentucky Arts Council and the Kentucky Foundation for Women among other honors. 
Her published books include “Goat-Footed Gods,” “Blue Etiquette: Poems,” “Next Door to the Dead” and “Seed Across Snow.” 
She also serves as the chair of Spalding University’s Naslund-Mann Graduate School of Writing in Louisville. Driskell will serve as the poet laureate from 2025-2026. 
A conversation with Silas House, Kentucky’s new poet laureate 

“All genres of art are important, but there’s something particularly humane about the work writers bring us,” Driskell said in the Capitol rotunda Thursday. 
“Language and creativity at the end are largely qualities that make us human. And so it’s not surprising that for so many of us, when we find our writing lives, we find our authentic lives,” she said. “We deepen our own ability to practice compassion, and we make lasting connections with our loved ones, our communities, and we carry our history forward.” 
House, who was appointed in 2023 and was the state’s first openly gay poet laureate, held writing workshops throughout the state and created an oral history project, among other initiatives during his tenure. 
“It has been such an honor to serve as poet laureate for the Commonwealth of Kentucky for the past two years,” House said. “In that time, this work has made my love for the state only deepen. I’ve had the opportunity to meet so many who are doing their best to be great neighbors and to make our world a better place.” 
House, who was a rural mail carrier in his native Eastern Kentucky, is author of many articles and novels, including “Clay’s Quilt,” “A Parchment of Leaves,” “Eli the Good” and “Lark Ascending.”
“My number one goal has always been to make more people aware how rich our literature is here in Kentucky, and to make writing instruction more accessible,” House said.  
Driskell will be inducted into House’s current role on April 24 in the rotunda. Both she and House will hold readings during that event. 
“We are fortunate to have her as a guiding voice,” Beshear said of Driskell, thanking her for “encouraging future writers and supporting Kentuckians in pursuing their dreams right here in their new Kentucky home.”

House Bil 432 directs the Revenue Law Study Committee to study options to enhance such programs and to consider other tax reforms to reduce property tax burdens for low-income elderly and disabled residents and disabled veterans.
  Rep. Brian Echevarria (Photo: NC General Assembly)
“This is a study bill and the reason we need this study bill is because other states have done things to protect their homeowners that I think we can follow,” said Rep. Brian Echevarria (R-Cabarrus), a bill cosponsor. “We have some states that have 100% property tax exclusions for veterans. They have better exclusions for the elderly and disabled.”
Big concerns, Echevarria said, are rising taxes and property tax revaluations, which are making it difficult for residents on fixed incomes to remain in their homes. Cabarrus County has been “decimated” by property revaluations and tax increases, he said.
“I’m sure that I’m not the only one who has received phone calls from the elderly, from the disabled, those on fixed incomes who simply don’t know how they’re going to keep up with increasing property taxes,” Echevarria said.
Several Democrats spoke in support of HB 432, including Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) who said he 100% backs the tax relief study.
“I’ve been worried about older people in my communities … [who] might eventually lose their homes because the property taxes are going up and up and up and their income is fixed,” Jones said. “I’m sure there’s nobody in here doesn’t know anybody like that.”
  Rep. Carla Cunningham (Photo: NC General Assembly)
Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg) noted that several bills have been introduced to provide tax relief for veterans and elderly and disabled North Carolinians. More must be done to keep veterans in the state and to encourage those from the state to return home after separating from the military, she said.
“I do know that we want to move forward to assist the veterans in the State of North Carolina not to leave North Carolina but to come home to North Carolina after they have served and that we should be assisting in any way that we can for them to come back home,” Cunningham said.
She noted that in South Carolina, veterans who are totally or permanently disabled from wartime may receive a property tax exemption on their home.
Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) said the bill is vastly improved compared to previous versions but reminded colleagues that property taxes pay for essential services such as public schools.
  Rep. Marcia Morey (Photo: NC General Assembly)
“They [property taxes] are not a regressive tax like a sales tax and I don’t want to see a study go into a shift of tax consequences that are more regressive on the poor that they are on the rich,” Morey said.
She asked if bill sponsors had sought input from the NC Association of County Commissioners and the NC League of Municipalities and whether the groups support the bill.
Echevarria said he hadn’t received input from either organization.
North Carolina currently offers three property tax relief programs for qualified homeowners that are administered by counties:

The Elderly/Disabled Homestead Exemption is for residents 65 years or older or those who are totally and permanently disabled. The program excludes from taxes the greater of $25,000 or 50% of the assessed value of the owner’s permanent residence.
The Circuit Breaker limits the amount of annual property taxes the owner pays on their permanent residence. Eligibility is limited to homeowners who are 65 and older or who are totally and permanently disabled. The tax bill is limited to a fixed percentage of income, and any taxes owed above that limit is deferred until a “disqualifying event” such as the owner’s death. This program requires a new application to be filed every year.
The Disabled Veteran Exclusion program excludes up to the first $45,000 of the appraised value of the permanent residence of a disabled veteran who has a total and permanent service-connected disability or who received benefits for specially adapted housing. There is no age or income limitation for this program.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/development-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 15:10:45.240723

(Photo from the CDC)Most Americans learned what an N95 mask was during the COVID-19 pandemic. But what many still don’t know is that every one of them was certified by a single, government-run lab in Bruceton, Pennsylvania. It’s called the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. The name N95 actually comes from their certification standards.
The lab, near Pittsburgh, is operated by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety and is the only facility in the country that is capable of offering the agency’s stamp of approval. The same lab certifies a host of other protective masks and respirators used by firefighters, doctors, painters, factory workers, coal miners, pharmaceutical manufacturers, welders, chemical plant employees, construction crews and others. Many American employers are statutorily required to provide them to workers.
An estimated 5 million Americans workers are required to use respirators at their place of employment.
But according to a dozen current and former NIOSH employees and union representatives who have worked at or with their personal protective equipment division, that lab has halted almost all of its regular work and is preparing to shut down in June.
That’s because of the most recent announcement of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency, run by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees across its various divisions. Hundreds of those cuts are in NIOSH, the division that studies and recommends ways to prevent workplace health and safety hazards.
“It’s kind of the sabotage of guide rails that have been set up for industry to help keep workers safe,” said Jonathan Szalajda, a lab employee and former deputy director of the National Personal Protective Technology Lab. “It’s a situation where we’re leaving workers defenseless, and I think it’s certainly a step back from what we’ve done to protect workers over the last half century.”
Since the beginning of mass layoffs at federal agencies overseen by the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency, virtually every employee at the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory has taken a buyout or early retirement offer, been put on administrative leave, or received a notice that their job is subject to what’s called a “reduction in force” and that their last day will come in June. 
It’s not clear if the impending layoffs will hit every remaining employee because, according to workers and union officials, leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control have not been answering questions. Moreover, almost all of the lab’s supervisors have been placed on administrative leave, along with their HR contact.
The reduction in force notices are confusing as well. Some sent out to individual employees note that layoffs will happen in their division, and they may or may not be subject to them. But another sent to the union that oversees the bargaining unit employees at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab said all of their jobs would be eliminated. Virtually every lab employee that isn’t part of that union has already been placed on leave or told their position will be terminated in June.
Given the lack of communication, and the sweeping layoffs that have hit other parts of the federal government, including NIOSH itself, employees at the personal protective equipment division are expecting the worst.
Already, the lab’s workforce has shrunk from 120 to 70 this year, and the remaining employees are facing layoffs that the Department of Health and Human Services says will come in June.
A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referred questions to the Department of Health and Human Services, which did not respond to multiple inquiries from the Capital-Star. NIOSH is a research agency within the CDC, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
“We have no idea what we’re supposed to do,” said one remaining lab employee who spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “We have no idea what to tell the manufacturers. This is so important, we just feel there’s no way this can be real.”
Szalajda said the lab has stopped accepting requests from manufacturers to certify new respirators. The remaining lab employees who weren’t laid off have shifted their focus to preparing for the lab to be shut down.
New research has also stopped because of time constraints and a freeze on federal employee credit cards that has made it impossible to buy necessary materials.
Instead, workers are finalizing research projects that are near completion, and preparing them for publication.
  ‘Someone will have to own the travesty’ 

Szalajda and others have said they expect the lab’s closure to result in the market being flooded with substandard masks.
Along with certifying new products, lab employees regularly inspect respirator manufacturing plants and test masks that have already been approved to ensure they’re still being manufactured to NIOSH standards. That work, however, has stopped, largely because of a freeze on approval of employee travel reimbursement. According to Szalajda, the lab has also stopped sending out contractors because they’re not certain they’ll ever be paid given the rapid changes.
Szalajda worries about “a Wild West scenario” where respirator manufacturers are free to cut corners in production, and no one will be there to catch them.
“The American public, if you’re buying a respirator or a mask to do home improvements or hobbies or anything, you’re going to be at the mercy of those companies to not become lax,” said Linda Chasko, a NIOSH employee who was speaking in her capacity as vice president of the federal employees union that includes the Allegheny County NIOSH campus employees.
The potential closure has also alarmed industry members, who have spent significant time and money ensuring their respirators meet NIOSH standards, and rely on the certification for new products.
The closure of the lab could also cede the respirator market to foreign companies whose products are tested according to their own government’s standards. NIOSH certification, however, had often been referred to as a “gold standard,” Szalajda said.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, KN95 masks were often billed as an alternative to N95s, which were at times difficult to find. The primary difference is that KN95s were certified in China. However, issues were found with a number of certified KN95s, which led to numerous recalls.
There is also a fear that counterfeit masks will spread. Part of the Personal Protective Technology Lab’s mission was to find and study respirators with fake NIOSH-approval stamps, and work with distributors to stop their spread.
One of the last research projects that lab employees are working to finalize is a comprehensive study on the efficacy of counterfeit masks. They found that virtually all of them failed to consistently meet NIOSH standards for filtering air particulates. Between an HHS communications freeze and uncertainty that the report can be finalized before the lab closes, it’s unclear if the report will ever be released to the public.
“We’re expecting there could potentially be an influx of counterfeit equipment,” said Chasko. “What’s at stake is the respiratory health and overall health of all the workers in industries that use equipment reliant on NIOSH standards.”
The lab’s closure could also cause problems for certain industries, like coal, where companies are statutorily required to provide NIOSH-certified respirators for miners. It’s unclear what will happen if NIOSH is no longer able to provide that certification.
For example, every underground coal mine is required by law to provide specialized respirators called closed-circuit escape respirators. They’re for the worst case scenario: Escaping a deadly and low-oxygen environment where something has likely gone very wrong.
Those respirators are not just approved by NIOSH, but regularly audited by the lab to ensure they still work after being stored in harsh underground conditions with heavy dust exposure. The same masks are also required in certain Navy ships.
“We have found failures,” one employee said about their regular audits.
Personal protective equipment researchers in Morgantown, West Virginia, the other NIOSH office where research on respirators and protective gear is done, were also hit with layoffs.
One Morgantown NIOSH employee who worked with the personal protective equipment team on firefighter safety recommendations was notified on April 1 that they would immediately be placed on administrative leave. That will end with their termination on June 1.
Still, they’re hoping the decision will be reversed, and requested anonymity for fear of being targeted in the event that some employees are brought back.
“We were told it was just going to be a consolidation … that the scientists would not be let go,” the employee said about the layoffs, which have affected almost everyone at the Morgantown NIOSH campus. “But the scientists went in the first round.”
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the federal employee union that represents the Morgantown NIOSH employees, said almost all work at the division has stopped, with almost everyone put on administrative leave ahead of terminations in June.
“You wouldn’t believe how confusing it’s been,” Tinney-Zara said. She said leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have not been communicating with union officials. She can’t even provide an exact number of workers who have been told they’re being laid off.
Mostly, she gets updates through the news like everyone else. Most recently, U.S. Rep. Riley Moore, a West Virginia Republican, said some of the layoffs at the Morgantown facility, which does extensive work on coal miner safety, were made in error. But Tinney-Zara hasn’t been able to confirm that or find out where he got that information.
“It’s a real tragedy,” Szalajda said about the lab’s closure and cuts at NIOSH. “For people who work in this business, it’s not just the paycheck. It’s a lifestyle. People who have been involved within our division, they work there because of a mission, the attractiveness of doing something that makes a difference in people’s lives.”
But Szalajda is hopeful that HHS may still reverse course. He and other employees are waging something of a pressure campaign by reaching out to lawmakers, industry partners and media.
Moreover, he believes that even if the lab, or most of NIOSH, is shut down now, one day it will be replaced. But it may be a hard learning curve for whoever’s brought in to get it running. He expects many of the most experienced people on staff now, would not return.
“It’s just kind of a recipe for disaster,” Szalajda said. “It may not be something that happens right away, but there will be some sort of incident that will show the void of what’s been left from stepping away, and someone will have to own the travesty that comes after that.”

Mike Dunleavy vetoed an education funding bill on Thursday, citing a lack of policy changes he supported.
House Bill 69 would have increased the base student allocation — the core of the state’s per-student funding — by $1,000 in the funding formula. The BSA has not been substantially increased for more than a decade, and public school advocates testified that inflation-driven cost increases have resulted in cuts to programs, school closures, and larger class sizes. 
The governor’s veto is subject to a vote of the Alaska Legislature. Under the Alaska Constitution, a vote to confirm or override the vote must be held “immediately,” but multiple lawmakers have said that the bill lacks enough support for a veto override. Votes from 40 of 60 state legislators, meeting in joint session, are needed for an override. 
Last year, the education funding bill included a $680 per-student increase. That bill had broad bipartisan support, with only three Republican legislators voting against it. But after Dunleavy vetoed it, 20 Republicans voted to uphold the veto. This year, all 25 members of the two Republican minority caucuses voted against the bill, as did the three co-chairs of the Senate Finance Committee.

A KFF Health News analysis underscores that the terminations are sparing no part of the country, politically or geographically. About 40% of organizations whose grants the NIH cut in its first month of slashing, which started Feb. 28, are in states Trump won in November.
The Trump administration has singled out Ivy League universities including Columbia and Harvard for broad federal funding cuts. But the spending reductions at the NIH, the nation’s foremost source of funding for biomedical research, go much further: Of about 220 organizations that had grants terminated, at least 94 were public universities, including flagship state schools in places such as Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Nebraska, and Texas.
The Trump administration has canceled hundreds of grants supporting research on topics such as vaccination; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and the health of LGBTQ+ populations. Some of the terminations are a result of Trump’s executive orders to abandon federal work on diversity and equity issues. Others followed the Senate confirmation of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. Many mirror the ambitions laid out in Project 2025’s “Mandate for Leadership,” the conservative playbook for Trump’s second term.
Affected researchers say Trump administration officials are taking a cudgel to efforts to improve the lives of people who often experience worse health outcomes — ignoring a scientific reality that diseases and other conditions do not affect all Americans equally.
KFF Health News found that the NIH terminated about 780 grants or parts of grants between Feb. 28 and March 28, based on documents published by the Department of Health and Human Services and a list maintained by academic researchers. Some grants were canceled in full, while in other cases, only supplements — extra funding related to the main grant, usually for a shorter-term, related project — were terminated.
Among U.S. recipients, 96 of the institutions that lost grants in the first month are in politically conservative states including Florida, Ohio, and Indiana, where Republicans control the state government or voters reliably support the GOP in presidential campaigns, or in purple states such as North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that were presidential battleground states. An additional 124 institutions are in blue states.
Sybil Hosek, a research professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, helps run a network that focuses on improving care for people 13 to 24 years old who are living with or at risk for HIV. The NIH awarded Florida State University $73 million to lead the HIV project.
“We never thought they would destroy an entire network dedicated to young Americans,” said Hosek, one of the principal investigators of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. The termination “doesn’t make sense to us.”
NIH official Michelle Bulls is director of the Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration, which oversees grants policy and compliance across NIH institutes. In terminating the grant March 21, Bulls wrote that research “based primarily on artificial and nonscientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”
Adolescents and young adults ages 13 to 24 accounted for 1 in 5 new HIV infections in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“It’s science in its highest form,” said Lisa Hightow-Weidman, a professor at Florida State University who co-leads the network. “I don’t think we can make America healthy again if we leave youth behind.”
HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an emailed statement that “NIH is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities.” The NIH and the White House didn’t respond to requests for comment.
“As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” Hilliard said.
Harm to HIV, Vaccine Studies
The NIH, with its nearly $48 billion annual budget, is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, awarding nearly 59,000 grants in the 2023 fiscal year. The Trump administration has upended funding for projects that were already underway, stymied money for new applications, and sought to reduce how much recipients can spend on overhead expenses.
Those changes — plus the firing of 1,200 agency employees as part of mass layoffs across the government — are alarming scientists and NIH workers, who warn that they will undermine progress in combating diseases and other threats to the nation’s public health. On April 2, the American Public Health Association, Ibis Reproductive Health, and affected researchers, among others, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the NIH and HHS to halt the grant cancellations.
Two National Cancer Institute employees, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation, said its staff receives batches of grants to terminate almost daily. On Feb. 27, the cancer institute had more than 10,800 active projects, the highest share of the NIH’s roughly two dozen institutes and centers, according to the NIH’s website. At least 47 grants that NCI awarded were terminated in the first month.
Kennedy has said the NIH should take a years-long pause from funding infectious disease research. In November 2023, he told an anti-vaccine group, “I’m gonna say to NIH scientists, ‘God bless you all. Thank you for public service. We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years,’” according to NBC News.
For years, Kennedy has peddled falsehoods about vaccines — including that “no vaccine” is “safe and effective,” and that “there are other studies out there” showing a connection between vaccines and autism, a link that has repeatedly been debunked — and claimed falsely that HIV is not the only cause of AIDS.
KFF Health News found that grants in blue states were disproportionately affected, making up roughly two-thirds of terminated grants, many of them at Columbia University. The university had more grants terminated than all organizations in politically red states combined. On April 4, Democratic attorneys general in 16 states sued HHS and the NIH to block the agency from canceling funds.
Researchers whose funding was stripped said they stopped clinical trials and other work on improving care for people with HIV, reducing vaping and smoking rates among LGBTQ+ teens and young adults, and increasing vaccination rates for young children. NIH grants routinely span several years.
For example, Hosek said that when the youth HIV/AIDS network’s funding was terminated, she and her colleagues were preparing to launch a clinical trial examining whether a particular antibiotic that is effective for men to prevent sexually transmitted infections would also work for women.
“This is a critically important health initiative focused on young women in the United States,” she said. “Without that study, women don’t have access to something that men have.”
Other scientists said they were testing how to improve health outcomes among newborns in rural areas with genetic abnormalities, or researching how to improve flu vaccination rates among Black children, who are more likely to be hospitalized and die from the virus than non-Hispanic white children.
“It’s important for people to know that — if, you know, they are wondering if this is just a waste of time and money. No, no. It was a beautiful and rare thing that we did,” said Joshua Williams, a pediatric primary care doctor at Denver Health in Colorado who was researching whether sharing stories about harm experienced due to vaccine-preventable diseases — from missed birthdays to hospitalizations and job loss — might inspire caregivers to get their children vaccinated against the flu.
He and his colleagues had recruited 200 families, assembled a community advisory board to understand which vaccinations were top priorities, created short videos with people who had experienced vaccine-preventable illness, and texted those videos to half of the caregivers participating in the study.
They were just about to crack open the medical records and see if it had worked: Were the group who received the videos more likely to follow through on vaccinations for their children? That’s when he got the notice from the NIH.
“It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” the notice read.
Williams said the work was already having an impact as other institutions were using the idea to start projects related to cancer and dialysis.
A Hit to Rural Health
Congress previously tried to ensure that NIH grants also went to states that historically have had less success obtaining biomedical research funding from the government. Now those places aren’t immune to the NIH’s terminations.
Sophia Newcomer, an associate professor of public health at the University of Montana, said she had 18 months of work left on a study examining undervaccination among infants, which means they were late in receiving recommended childhood vaccines or didn’t receive the vaccines at all. Newcomer had been analyzing 10 years of CDC data about children’s vaccinations and had already found that most U.S. infants from 0 to 19 months old were not adequately vaccinated.
Her grant was terminated March 10, with the NIH letter stating the project “no longer effectuates agency priorities,” a phrase replicated in other termination letters KFF Health News has reviewed.
“States like Montana don’t get a lot of funding for health research, and health researchers in rural areas of the country are working on solutions to improve rural health care,” Newcomer said. “And so cuts like this really have an impact on the work we’re able to do.”
Montana is one of 23 states, along with Puerto Rico, that are eligible for the NIH’s Institutional Development Award program, meant to bolster NIH funding in states that historically have received less investment. Congress established the program in 1993.
The NIH’s grant terminations hit institutions in 15 of those states, more than half that qualify, plus Puerto Rico.
Researchers Can’t ‘Just Do It Again Later’
The NIH’s research funds are deeply entrenched in the U.S. health care system and academia. Rarely does an awarded grant stay within the four walls of a university that received it. One grant’s money is divvied up among other universities, hospitals, community nonprofits, and other government agencies, researchers said.
Erin Kahle, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, said she was working with Emory University in Georgia and the CDC as part of her study. She was researching the impact of intimate partner violence on HIV treatment among men living with the virus. “They are relying on our funds, too,” she said.
Kahle said her top priority was to ethically and safely wind down her nationwide study, which included 418 people, half of whom were still participating when her grant was terminated in late March. Kahle said that includes providing resources to participants for whom sharing experiences of intimate partner violence may cause trauma or mental health distress.
Rachel Hess, the co-director of the Clinical & Translational Science Institute at the University of Utah, said the University of Nevada-Reno and Intermountain Health, one of the largest hospital systems in the West, had received funds from a $38 million grant that was awarded to the University of Utah and was terminated March 12.
The institute, which aims to make scientific research more efficient to speed up the availability of treatments for patients, supported over 5,000 projects last year, including 550 clinical trials with 7,000 participants. Hess said that, for example, the institute was helping design a multisite study involving people who have had heart attacks to figure out the ideal mix of medications “to keep them alive” before they get to the hospital, a challenge that’s more acute in rural communities.
After pushback from the university — the institute’s projects included work to reduce health care disparities between rural and urban areas — the NIH restored its grant March 29.
Among the people the Utah center thanked in its announcement about the reversal were the state’s congressional delegation, which consists entirely of Republican lawmakers. “We are grateful to University of Utah leadership, the University of Utah Board of Trustees, our legislative delegation, and the Utah community for their support,” it said.
Hilliard, of HHS, said that “some grants have been reinstated following the appeals process, and the agency will continue to carry out the remaining appeals as planned to determine their alignment.” She declined to say how many had been reinstated, or why the University of Utah grant was among them.
Other researchers haven’t had the same luck. Kahle, in Michigan, said projects like hers can take a dozen years from start to finish — applying for and receiving NIH funds, conducting the research, and completing follow-up work.
“Even if there are changes in the next administration, we’re looking at at least a decade of setting back the research,” Kahle said. “It’s not as easy as like, ‘OK, we’ll just do it again later.’ It doesn’t really work that way.”
 Methodology

KFF Health News analyzed National Institutes of Health grant data to determine the states and organizations most affected by the Trump administration’s cuts.
We tallied the number of terminated NIH grants using two sources: a Department of Health and Human Services list of terminated grants published April 4; and a crowdsourced list maintained by Noam Ross of rOpenSci and Scott Delaney of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, as of April 8. We focused on the first month of terminations: from Feb. 28 to March 28. We found that 780 awards were terminated in total, with 770 of them going to recipients based in U.S. states and two to recipients in Puerto Rico.
The analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements, which we know happened in at least one instance.
Additional information on the recipients, such as location and business type, came from the USAspending.gov Award Data Archive.
There were 222 U.S. recipients in total. At least 94 of them were public higher education institutions. Forty-one percent of organizations that had NIH grants cut in the first month were in states that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election.
Some recipients, including the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Vanderbilt University Medical Center, are medical facilities associated with higher education institutions. We classified these as hospitals/medical centers.
We also wanted to see whether the grant cuts affected states across the political spectrum. We generally classified states as blue if Democrats control the state government or Democratic candidates won them in the last three presidential elections, and red if they followed this pattern but for Republicans. Purple states are generally presidential battleground states or those where voters regularly split their support between the two parties: Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was also blue.
We found that, of affected U.S. institutions, 96 were in red or purple states and 124 were in blue states.

(Courtesy photo)The state’s biggest electrical utility said it shut off power to about 2,300 customers in Las Vegas Thursday in a pre-emptive move to prevent wildfires. 
PNM says it initiated the “public safety power shutoff” at 11:30 a.m. in the Northern New Mexico town. The outage could last up to 48 hours depending on conditions, officials said.
The area is experiencing extreme fire conditions, thanks to prolonged drought, large buildup of fuel, high temperatures, low humidity and increased winds, according to PNM. A National Weather Service high wind warning says gusts could reach 65 mph. 
“The decision to shut off power will be made only as a last resort to protect lives and property from the threat of wildfire,” PNM officials said in a news release earlier Thursday.
All of New Mexico is under either a high wind or Red Flag warning imposed by the National Weather Service, which indicates high wildfire risk. The high wind warning is in effect through most of northwestern New Mexico, including Las Vegas, and the Red Flag warning is in effect everywhere else. 
PNM has warned repeatedly this year that it could impose  pre-emptive power shutoffs, including in East Mountains of Albuquerque, Las Vegas and elsewhere, though it had not yet done so until Thursday. 
The utility has never done a pre-emptive shutoff before, officials said at a recent news conference, but said it is increasingly necessary due to extreme wildfire conditions.
The utility has also been sued for wildfires in recent years, including the McBride Fire in Ruidoso. A law firm accused it of negligence for allowing a tree to be blown onto a powerline it controls, but the utility has denied any liability.

Jill Carter, a Republican from Granby, sits at her desk on the Senate floor. Carter has filed a bill for three consecutive years on school accreditation and accountability (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Senate sent a bill to the House Thursday that would overhaul the state’s accreditation and accountability system in order to give local school districts more control.
State Sen. Jill Carter, a Republican from Granby, has filed the bill for three consecutive years and garnered approval for public-school advocates in committee. But each year it has been passed over for other priorities when it reached the full Senate.
Skepticism from state Sen. Curtis Trent, a Republican from Springfield, slowed the bill’s passage this year and inspired a lengthy debate about accountability earlier this month. 
But Monday, he applauded Carter for “helping work through the concerns that I had.”
Carter tweaked the legislation Monday to clarify sections and add an expiration date to a provision limiting the State Board of Education’s authority to classify districts.
It was approved by the Senate Thursday on a 32 to one vote, with Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman as the only opponent. 
If the bill passes the House, school districts will be able to seek accreditation from national accreditation agencies in addition to the State Board of Education. The board can classify districts without outside accreditation as provisionally accredited or unaccredited only for the purpose of determining whether a charter school can open within a district’s boundaries. State law allows charters to open the area of unaccredited districts and those that have been provisionally accredited for at least three years.
Carter’s legislation also requires schools to post performance data on their websites. Previous versions of the bill specified the data would be sent to “media outlets serving the district.”
It also changes a requirement for “interim assessments” at the beginning and end of the school year to “local assessments” without specified times.
Carter believes the legislation would give school boards and parents more power over curriculum and personalize learning to a district’s needs.
“I think this is a first step in trying to mitigate a lot of the concerns that we’ve had and educators have had in our public schools,” she said Monday.
There is just under a month remaining in the current legislative session. If Carter’s bill doesn’t pass the House in coming weeks, she will have to start over in the process next year.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Senate has sent a bill to Gov. Kim Reynolds’s desk that would bar penalization from accreditors to universities for following state law, despite concerns from some lawmakers that it would not prevent universities from potentially losing accreditation.
House File 295 would bar higher education accrediting bodies from taking negative action against state universities that follow or refuse to be noncompliant with state law, like legislation passed in the state prohibiting universities from funding or maintaining diversity, equity and inclusion offices.
The bill also removes mention of the Higher Learning Commission and replaces it with “any federally recognized accreditor of postsecondary educational institutions,” a move Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, said could lead to universities choosing lower-quality accreditors and “call into question” students’ degrees.
“I think that we are heading down a path that is creating political cover for laws that are being passed that conflict with gold standards of higher education,” Winckler said.

Sens. Janice Weiner of Iowa City and Herman Quirmbach of Ames agreed with Winckler, saying if Iowa universities stop using the “gold standard” Higher Learning Commission, students may choose to take their tuition dollars somewhere else and education in Iowa could deteriorate as a result.
Weiner reiterated that legislation to create a center for intellectual freedom at the University of Iowa could endanger the university’s accreditation, and said the introduction of House File 295 told her “the majority party knowingly is putting the university’s accreditation at risk.”
“We could be voting, and we could be focusing on helping UIHC find a cure for the cancer plague in this state. Instead, we’re dealing with a bill that knowingly risks the school’s accreditation,” Weiner said. “It’s like we’ve stepped through the looking glass.”
Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott, said there was “a little bit of exaggeration” in the comments from his colleagues about the dangers of Iowa universities losing accreditation or using lower-quality accreditors. He doesn’t expect any problems to arise with current or proposed legislation, including the bill to establish the UI intellectual freedom center.
The bill passed with a 32-15 vote.
“You know, these past couple weeks, we have heard a lot of concern about intellectual freedom, diversity, allowing both sides to speak,” Gruenhagen said. “Instituting this in a college should have been an easy ‘yes’ vote for both sides of this chamber, according to floor arguments that I’ve been hearing. Unfortunately, we did not hear those. We did not receive a yes. Here’s another chance to say ‘yes’ to provide opportunities.”

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) on Wednesday issued a blistering final report on the January water crisis that left Richmond residents and businesses without clean drinking water for days — and delivered a second formal notice of violation against the city, demanding a full corrective action plan.
The 314-page VDH report, based on a 60-day independent investigation by the engineering firm Short Elliott Hendrickson (SEH), found a long chain of preventable failures at the city’s 100-year-old Water Treatment Plant. 
These included neglected maintenance, faulty backup systems, poor emergency planning, and risky decisions that left the plant vulnerable during a winter storm. A single power outage on the morning of Jan. 6 led to catastrophic flooding of underground equipment rooms, halting water production and triggering a system-wide drop in pressure that forced boil water advisories across the city and surrounding counties for nearly a week.
“This crisis could have been prevented with better operational decisions,” said State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton, who described the findings in stark terms. “Our goal now is to ensure corrective actions are taken swiftly and effectively, so Richmond-area families can trust their water supply.”
The report revealed that city officials were operating the plant in “winter mode,” relying solely on overhead power lines despite known flood risks and vulnerabilities. When those lines failed, the backup systems didn’t work — largely because of neglected maintenance. Critical batteries weren’t tested. Key valves didn’t shut, and manual procedures meant to kick in during emergencies proved ineffective.
In her letter to Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Richmond Mayor Danny Avula, Shelton didn’t mince words. As reported by The Richmonder this week, she contrasted VDH’s investigation with the city’s own internal review, asserting that “the water crisis was completely avoidable and should not have happened.”
Youngkin echoed that sentiment in a statement Wednesday, calling the disruption of a safe and reliable water supply “unacceptable.” He said, “It should never happen again, and I’ve directed the Department of Health to ensure Richmond takes all corrective actions necessary to achieve that objective.” 
The governor praised Richmond-area residents for their resilience, saying they “persevered through this preventable crisis,” and now city leaders must “step up for their citizens.”
The report outlines a cascade of failures triggered by a relatively minor snow and ice event. 
Around 5:45 a.m. on Jan. 6, the Water Treatment Plant lost power. A bus tie switch designed to transfer power from a backup source failed, and for over an hour, the facility operated in the dark. Water continued to flow through the plant by gravity — into a subsurface clearwell — but without power, key valves stayed open. 
Water inundated the underground equipment rooms, flooding critical pumps and electrical systems. Backup batteries, which were supposed to shut valves and prevent flooding, had not been maintained and failed.
By the time the city issued a Boil Water Advisory that afternoon, it was already too late. Pressure had dropped below safe levels, and the city struggled for days to restore full water service. Water production was partially restored on Jan. 8, and fully restored the next day. The boil order wasn’t lifted until Jan. 11.
The VDH and SEH review paints a broader picture of systemic dysfunction at the Department of Public Utilities (DPU). Investigators described a “culture of complacency,” where staff had normalized working around broken or substandard systems instead of fixing them. Manual operation was routine. Training was limited. And serious risks — like flooding from the clearwell — were well known but never resolved.
Despite this, officials say there are signs of progress. 
Mayor Danny Avula said he was “incredibly proud” of the work DPU Director Scott Morris and his team have done since the crisis, noting that much of the VDH’s report aligns with an independent investigation the city commissioned from the firm HNTB. 
“We’ll of course review it and think through the best ways to integrate its recommendations into our work moving forward,” Avula said in a statement.
The city has already spent $5 million on emergency repairs and is proposing more than $60 million in upgrades as part of its five-year capital improvement plan. The plan includes electrical upgrades, automation improvements, and a redesigned overflow system for the clearwell to prevent future flooding. 
Still, the city will now be required to implement a formal Corrective Action Plan under the second notice of violation issued by VDH this week.
Janet Kelly, Virginia’s Secretary of Health and Human Resources, said the water crisis exposed both long-standing infrastructure problems and serious day-of operational failures. 
“An entire region including businesses, restaurants, schools, and the most vulnerable citizens in Richmond lost a basic human need,” she said. “We hope that the city of Richmond continues to address both the long-term and immediate components of this crisis.”
The SEH report also includes a sweeping “needs assessment” of Richmond’s water infrastructure, identifying over $63 million in additional improvements needed across the treatment plant and distribution system. These include relocating vulnerable electrical equipment, installing automated transfer switches, and updating decades-old design elements that are still allowed under legacy exemptions to state water regulations.
In all, the SEH team spent nearly 1,500 hours combing through records, touring facilities, interviewing staff, and analyzing system data. They concluded that while DPU staff showed commitment and technical know-how, the broader system failed to prioritize its most important goal: delivering safe, reliable water to the people of Richmond.
To help local businesses and nonprofits recover from the storm’s economic toll, Youngkin also announced Wednesday that the U.S. Small Business Administration has made Economic Injury Disaster Loans available. These loans aim to help organizations hurt by January’s power and water outages to cover ongoing operational costs.
Looking ahead, the state says it will work closely with city officials to ensure every recommendation is taken seriously. 
“We can’t afford another crisis like this,” said Shelton. “And we won’t accept another excuse.”

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos / NJ Monitor)The New Mexico Court of Appeals this week rejected a challenge to state law prohibiting people convicted of felonies in the past decade from possessing firearms.
A jury convicted Jeremy Romero, of Las Vegas, of unlawfully possessing a firearm and evading Albuquerque police in August 2022, and a judge sentenced him to eight years in prison.
A few days later, he challenged the felon-in-posession statute’s constitutionality, arguing that it violates his Second Amendment right to possess a gun.
In a unanimous opinion published on Wednesday, a three-judge panel at the New Mexico Court of Appeals ruled that the law stands because there’s a long history of Congress and state legislatures disarming people who are a danger to others, so the law itself is constitutional.
In court briefings and at oral arguments in February, Romero’s attorney argued that his prior convictions were for nonviolent offenses, so it was unconstitutional to apply the felon-in-possession statute against him.
Mary Barket, Romero’s public defender, also argued that the country’s historical prohibitions on gun possession weren’t similar enough to New Mexico’s law because they targeted groups during times of war and conflict “that posed an existential threat to the ruling government.”
“I do not think that that is similar to why we’re trying to justify disarming felons, both violent and nonviolent,” Barket told the judges.
The judges weren’t convinced, and ruled that Romero did not challenge the trial court’s findings that he is dangerous based on his criminal history of possessing and selling drugs and escape from house arrest, so the law is also constitutional as it was applied to him.
While the ruling does not create any new rule about what’s needed to prove that someone is dangerous, it does require that for the government to constitutionally apply the felon-in-possession statute to someone, prosecutors “must demonstrate that the defendant presents a threat to others,” the judges wrote.
Romero based his challenge on the legal standard established by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 for analyzing the constitutionality of firearms regulations, in a case called Bruen.
Nonprofit news organization The Trace reviewed more than 2,000 court cases that cited Bruen and found that people whose felony records bar them from possessing guns used the decision more often than any other group.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin sued the messaging app Discord Thursday under the state Consumer Fraud Act, saying the tech giant has failed to protect underage users from sexual predators, harassment, and violent content.
Platkin, who also has sued TikTok and Meta, alleges Discord misleads parents and users about the efficacy of its “porous security features that Discord knows do not work as promised.” The decade-old platform, which caters to teens and gamers, has 200 million users.
“Too often, parents feel helpless as rich and powerful corporations find new ways to put harmful content literally directly into our kids’ hands, callously placing their own profits ahead of the safety and well-being of our children,” Platkin said at a news conference in Newark. 
Platkin pointed to violent incidents involving white supremacists who used the platform to plan or publicize their crimes, including a deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and a 2022 mass shooting at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that left 10 dead.
Platkin said his office launched its investigation after the Buffalo massacre and found that Discord, even as it publicly promotes its safety measures, fails to enforce them, making it “alarmingly easy for predators and other malicious actors to target children on the app.”
“There’s very little to prevent kids from connecting with and receiving messages from complete strangers on their platform. This includes strangers who are adults pretending to be kids, something that should be a red flag for every parent,” Platkin said.
Discord prohibits children under 13 on its platform, he added, “but it barely enforces its own rule.”
“All a child has to do to access the app is just say they’re 13. Discord will take any 8-year-old’s word for it,” he said.
He added: “There are very few roadblocks between a child under the age of 10 accessing Discord and being groomed in a private chat or coerced to engage in self-harm. It’s horrifying, sickening, and it’s especially horrifying and sickening given that Discord users in New Jersey exchange billions of direct messages on the app every year.”

Officials from Discord, which is based in San Francisco, did not respond to a request for comment.

At this time, details are still unfolding, and we do not yet have specific information to share. However, we want to assure the community that our teams are fully mobilized and prepared to provide the highest level of care and support to all those affected,” a written statement says.
“We remain in close coordination with emergency responders and public safety officials. Out of respect for patient privacy and to ensure accurate information, we will provide updates as soon as they are available. We ask for your patience and compassion during this difficult time.”
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement, meanwhile, posted on X that its officers were on the scene and would issue an update “with more information as soon as possible.”

A proposal that would prohibit local governments from suspending the sale of guns and ammunition during a declared state of emergency was approved in the Florida House on Wednesday.
The measure (HB 6025) sponsored by Brevard County Republicans Monique Miller and Debbie Mayfield, repeals current state law that prohibits the sale of firearms and ammunition during a local state of emergency. The bill would also repeal the prohibition banning anyone intentionally possessing a firearm in a public place during a local emergency.
South Florida Democratic Rep. Mike Gottlieb said that he had voted for the bill in an earlier committee meeting, but that upon reading the actual state statute that it would repeal (section 870.044) was now opposing it.
“What we’re saying is that if there’s a riot or public disturbance we’re just going to let everybody sort of willy-nilly, without the controls that we have in place, get their firearms, and that’s adding fuel to that riot,” he said. “That’s adding fuel to that fire.”
Gottlieb added that he believed it had “wide-ranging implications that could endanger us in society.”
But Republicans said it was more than an appropriate change.
“When our communities are ripped by unrest or emergency, when the lights go out and the sirens grow louder and the sense of order is fading, that is precisely the moment when Floridians deserve the freedom to defend themselves, their children, their homes and their livelihoods,” said Seminole County Republican Rachel Plakon.
“When I came up here I promised my constituents that one of the most important things that I would do is I would fine laws that violate their constitutional rights, and I would get rid of them,” said Miller. “This is one of the most egregious that I found.”
The measure passed 86-28, mostly along party lines.
The Senate version (SB 952) sponsored by Hernando County Republican Blaise Ingoglia has passed all of its committees and is awaiting a floor vote in that chamber.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gun-2048x1490-1-1024x745.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 13:14:17.555699

(Photo via Getty Images)A University of Iowa student who feels his online security and that of all UI students who use Zoom to access classes has been compromised has brought a lawsuit against the university, alleging negligence and seeking relief and an order for the university to secure its online instruction.
Marc Muklewicz, a 46-year-old criminology student close to finishing his degree, said an unauthorized video taken of him in an online class and posted online led to his learning that anyone with the link to a Zoom course at UI could access it without needing to log in with university credentials or any other form of verification.
The UI has refused to remedy the situation and ensure his and other students’ data is private, Muklewicz said, and he is currently refusing to attend classes until he knows that when he logs into a course, he is safe in doing so.
“I can’t share anything academically, honestly, freely, in any sense of the word, if I can’t assure that my information is being private,” Muklewicz said.

Muklewicz first learned of the video taken of him smoking an e-cigarette during an online course through his wife, who started receiving messages from friends and acquaintances about a post made by an affiliate of Barstool on Instagram featuring the video.
How the video was cut, leaving out the e-cigarette and only showing Muklewicz blowing out smoke, implied to some that he was using drugs during class, Muklewicz said. After realizing the video was taken during class, Muklewicz said he emailed his professor, who reached out to the Office of Student Accountability and reiterated to students that taking recordings like this one is unacceptable.
UI Public Relations Manager Steve Schmadeke said in an email the university employs “standard security protocols” for online courses, including restricting access to “authenticated students who must sign in using their unique UI credentials.”
“Students are expected to follow course policies and the code of student life. That code would apply if an individual were identified secretly recording a classmate using a personal device,” Schmadeke said in his email. “The university also offers support services for any student who may experience a privacy violation.”
Muklewicz said what he heard from the Office of Student Accountability was that identifying whoever took the video would be “difficult,” and the office suggested reaching out to university police and changing his name on Zoom to better protect his privacy.

Using his experience from working for Microsoft and GoDaddy in the past, Muklewicz said he found out about the Zoom security issues while trying to work out for himself who could have taken the video.
“I was like, ‘This is so easy, I’ll identify it in five minutes and throw it back at them,’ but then what I came to quickly find out is, wait a minute, I accidentally was able to log in with no credentials,” Muklewicz said.
According to the UI’s posted information on Zoom security, all meetings have a passcode attached for access, but all invitation links automatically include it so no one needs to enter it themselves.
If Zoom classes are accessible to anyone with the link, Muklewicz said information like students’ names, email addresses, images and other information are vulnerable. Those with more “nefarious” intentions and the know-how could use the data they get from a Zoom class to trace a student’s IP address to their location, if they’re using university wi-fi.
While his professors have understood his concerns and the decision to stop attending classes, Muklewicz said the UI administration’s response is what led him to both file a Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, complaint and a lawsuit. FERPA serves to protect student education records in all levels of learning, from elementary to post-secondary.
“If we take this serious, great. We can mitigate anything, any harm that’s been done,” Muklewicz said. “And literally, I think all they have to do is take the default permissions off of Zoom and take that and leave it to admin control.”
He was told by Mike Mueller, associate director of the Office of Student Accountability, that after review of the incident by legal counsel, this incident does not qualify as a FERPA violation as the UI does not maintain Zoom videos.
Counts listed against the university in the lawsuit include negligence, breach of contract, public disclosure of private facts and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and Muklewicz is seeking damages and a requirement that the UI secure its Zoom classes.
Muklewicz was able to attend the UI with financial support from Veterans’ Affairs as a veteran himself, and he is not currently working. He said he is working with his VA counselor on next steps and figuring out his benefits while not attending classes.
“I’m probably not going to graduate this term, it’s just compounding into a huge problem for me now,” Muklewicz said.

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Tennessee’s legislature recently overwhelmingly passed the Success Sequence Act, requiring public schools to teach about the positive outcomes of a life path that goes, in order: graduation from high school, moving on to jobs or further education, marriage and then having children.  It’s not bad advice, but one wonders about the merits of our state legislature offering it.  After all, we do not have required don’t-run-with-scissors instructional modules, or charity-is-a-good-thing week, and we are still waiting for success to come from decades of harangue-kids-about-drugs modules.
So, what’s really going on here? On one level it’s as simple as our legislators effectively yelling, “Hey, you kids are having sex way too casually and way too early!” One wonders if they ever thought about how the message would have been received decades ago by their teenage selves. Further, it is likely to be as ineffective as abstinence-only sex education. A November 2024 research article in the Journal of School Health put it succinctly, “Multiple studies indicate comprehensive sexuality programs are more effective than abstinence-only programs at reducing risky sexual behavior, and improving knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to sexual activity,” the researchers wrote.
On another level, however, this holds true to a political reality described in the books “Moral Politics” and “Don’t Think of an Elephant!,” both by George Lakoff. Self-described conservatives, and they dominate our state legislature, think of successful and wealthy people as having obtained this status because of moral clarity and good life choices. The impoverished are in that position by laziness, promiscuity, and bad choices. Liberals look more to social conditions; wealth often comes from inheritance, and poverty from things like low wages and poor health care.
‘Success sequence’ bill passes House, heads to governor’s desk for signature

Our legislature’s Success Sequence Act is virtue signaling to voters and not virtue referencing to students. It’s cut-and-paste legislation from the right-wing Heritage Foundation, already adopted by Utah and under consideration in Mississippi, Kentucky, Texas, and Ohio.
Tennessee’s sponsor, Rep. Gino Bulso of Brentwood, thinks such posturing in favor of nuclear families is the best remedy to poverty. Not exactly, at least not from him. He is in a public policy position so he should approach this from a public policy perspective — increasing the minimum wage, making even more opportunities available for post-secondary education, restricting child labor. Sadly, Bulso — and other lawmakers — are woefully deficient on these policy angles.
Members of the Tennessee legislature also might not be the best ones for giving such success in life advice. Former Sen. Brian Kelsey reported to prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, only to be pardoned by President Trump. A jury found former Sen. Katrina Robinson guilty of wire fraud  Sen. Ken Yager faces Driving Under the Influence charges in Georgia. In January 2021, former House Speaker Glen Casada and several other Tennessee legislators had their homes and offices raided in a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into laundered campaign money. 
Casada and his former chief of staff were indicted by a federal grand jury, charged with theft, bribery, and kickbacks, and the pair will go on trial April 22. Even if all those charged are not convicted, “life success” could be a stretch for their expertise. It’s fine that our legislature wants to pontificate on success in life, as long as they remember they are not the pontiff. We can seek our moral clarity from our pastors, parents, successful relatives, and other positive forces in young lives. As for our legislators, some legislation opening doors for young people would be a better use of their time.

Tillis to help stop Medicaid cuts",Christine Zhu,,,,,https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/advocates-health-providers-urge-sen-tillis-to-help-stop-medicaid-cuts/,"Republicans in Congress are considering up to $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, a program that gives access to health care for about 650,000 North Carolinians.","Dr. Beverly Edwards speaks at a Raleigh press conference at which health providers and advocates called on U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis to help stop planned cuts to Medicaid on April 17, 2025 (Photo: Progress NC Action YouTube video)A coalition of progressive advocacy groups joined with local health care providers at a Raleigh press conference Thursday to encourage Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis to protect Medicaid amid proposed federal cuts.
The event, which was organized by the Coalition Against Right-Wing Extremism (CARE), was intended to draw attention to a plan developed by congressional Republicans to squeeze $880 billion in cuts from Medicaid, a program that provides access to health care for about 3.1 million North Carolinians. Of that number, about 20% (650,000 people) are covered by Medicaid as a result of the program expansion state lawmakers enacted in 2023, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
Beverly Edwards lives in Ahoskie in northeastern North Carolina. A pediatrician serving families in rural areas of the state, she said she sees every day how essential Medicaid is to keeping children and families safe.
“In rural areas, access to health care is already hard to come by,” Edwards said. “There are fewer jobs that offer employee-sponsored health care than in some other areas. That means if people lose their health care through Medicaid, they don’t have any alternatives.”
In Edwards’ community, hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid payments in order to keep their doors open. If there are cuts, the effects would be felt across the area.
“Everyone in our community would be forced to travel even further for emergency care, prenatal care, or surgery, if they can get the care at all,” she said.
Alexandra Sirota, executive director of the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center, has been at her organization for 15 years.
During that time, she’s documented the way budget and tax policy choices impact opportunity for the state.
“North Carolinians want an economy that works for us all,” Sirota said. “Our elected leaders, through their policy choices, have the power to do just that.”
She called out Tillis for prioritizing wealthy and profitable corporations over North Carolinians and their families.
“We know that Senator Tillis has the power to stop these cuts now, before they ripple through our state and our daily lives, affecting whether North Carolinians can receive medical care, whether the nearest hospital can serve all our families, whether people in our community can afford healthy meals, and whether we can keep our jobs,” she said.
Research released recently by the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute found that imposing work requirements on Medicaid enrollees — a cost-cutting idea under consideration in Congress and recently endorsed by North Carolina Republican legislators — would result in as many as 30% of the state’s Medicaid expansion population losing coverage.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dr.-Beverly-Edwards.png,,,2025-04-17 13:14:17.555699

Bettison and police chiefs from Dearborn, Taylor, Livonia and other municipalities came to the Michigan House Government Operations Committee to offer support for a $115 million Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund being considered by lawmakers with the goal of distributing funds to local law enforcement to curb violent crime.
Community violence intervention, or CVI, programs such as ShotStoppers, Detroit Friends & Family and FORCE Detroit were able to reduce violent crime by up to 70%  in some service areas between November 2023 and January 2024, a report from the city found. The three programs in the report engage trusted community members in Detroit neighbors to implement tailored approaches to reduce gun violence in the city.

And though the fund will help to save lives in cities with higher crime rates like Detroit and Flint, Bettison said, many municipalities in Michigan will dramatically benefit from being able to form or strengthen their own CVI programs to curb violence.
Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford) went through a list off estimated distributions for communities the members on the committee represent: $176,000 for Owosso, $1.9 million for Flint, $261,000 for Waterford Township, $50,000 for Ludington, nearly $500,000 for Muskegon, $3.2 million for Grand Rapids and $1.1 million for Warren.
In Dearborn, one of Michigan’s most populous cities and neighbor to Detroit, City Police Chief Issa Shahin said in addition to investing in CVIs, his department plans on using funds to hire more staff and officers to respond faster to calls and engage more proactively with neighborhoods before crime can occur.
“This is more than just funding. It’s a commitment to public safety and smart, targeted and responsive to needs on the ground. I’ll just be honest, policing is expensive. Communities want well-staffed, well-trained and well-resourced departments and that costs money,” Shahin said. “This investment allows us to do that on behalf of our officers, our city and our residents.”
The Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund, which was proposed for $75 million last legislative session with bipartisan support has since been increased to $115 million in order to dedicate $40 million to county sheriffs. 
The fund still has bipartisan support in the Republican-majority state House, but GOP leadership has raised concern that the Democratic-led state Senate won’t take up the fund without trying to add other measures to it.

The Government Operations Committee, which has three Republicans and two Democrats, passed the bills that create the fund, HB 4260 and 4261, out of committee unanimously Thursday, urging their colleagues in both chambers of the Legislature to work towards the common goal of safer communities.
Funding public safety “isn’t about politics,” Harris said, “it’s about people.” 
“It’s about real families. It’s about real neighborhoods, and it’s about real law enforcement officers who need backup, and not just in the field, but here in Lansing from us.”

“The children of Delaware have the right to a happy and safe childhood, and it’s our responsibility as adults and organizations to stand up to protect that right,” said Georganne Buccine, YMCA of Delaware Vice President of Youth Development. “By joining in the Five Days of Action campaign, we hope to inspire other organizations and members of our community to create safe spaces that protect children from sexual abuse.”
Pledge and Pinwheels
Throughout the week, YMCA members are encouraged to sign a pledge committing to protect children from abuse. Those who participate will receive a blue pinwheel, the official symbol of child abuse prevention, as a visual show of support. Pinwheels and pledge forms will be available at the front desks of all YMCA of Delaware locations.
Know. See. Respond.
This year’s campaign brings back the “Know. See. Respond.” initiative, supported by child protection organizations including Praesidium, Saprea, and Lauren’s Kids.
The goal is to educate parents, caregivers, and community members on how to recognize warning signs of abuse and take action.
– Know: Learn what questions to ask when enrolling children in camps or activities to ensure abuse prevention policies are in place.
– See: Understand the subtle warning signs of grooming behavior and how to spot them.
– Respond: Use tools like the Trusted Triangle and the Safety NETwork to support children in speaking up and staying safe.
Resources and educational materials can be accessed through the YMCA’s partners and directly on their websites.

Whenever I travel outside the state, I don’t need a sign on the border to know I am home, because as soon as I hit that first pothole, I know I am home. Roads are critical for economic development and growth, and because of this, we understand that not only should they remain well-kept, but also publicly provided. This is a given, but it should not be done in a way that risks doing harm to public programs that millions of Michiganders rely on, such as schools, access to health care and putting food on our table.
Policymakers in Lansing all seem to agree that our roads are a priority. Both in her “Road Ahead Address” and her State of the State Address, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vowed to see her “fix the damn roads” promise to its end. Last month, the Michigan House of Representatives passed a road funding package to fund the fiscal cliff the state is facing, totaling more than $3 billion. The road funding package received bipartisan support, but will likely face revisions in this divided government, all a part of tense budget negotiations that will define the year ahead. 
The problem with this road funding package is not its end goal, but its method. It is full of uncertainty and tepid promises that “critical” programs will not face cuts or funding risks. Apart from a proposed tax increase on motor fuel, offsetting a reduction in the sales tax and a tax hike to pressure corporations to forgo subsidies under a former tax plan, proponents claim no new money is needed to fix the roads. Instead, existing state general fund dollars are shifted to roads and to fill the hole in the school aid fund and in community revenue sharing. Ultimately, the proposal passed by the House last month is estimated to reduce overall general fund revenues from 2026-2031 to the tune of about $17 billion.

However, this is like saying no new money is needed for a brand new car because I can just dip into our child’s college savings account. We have the money, but where we take it from matters a great deal. In fact, this is a worse scenario because, without a corresponding budget, we don’t know what existing programs could be impacted by this road proposal. Risking key programs to fund the roads will only result in a road that goes nowhere. If investments in libraries, child care centers, food banks or local schools are cut to make room for road funding, we’re neglecting what communities need most. Roads are meant to connect us to opportunities and resources, not come at their expense.
Underlying all of this, too, is an assumption that Michigan’s method in determining road funding is accurate. A recent report from the Citizens Research Council of Michigan shows that the way Michigan goes about fixing its roads is deeply flawed and antiquated, warranting investigation into policies that improve efficiency and quality of our road systems as well as how we allocate the dollars. Additionally, our existing formula and budget continue to underfund our public transit system, leading to limited service access all across the state. Michigan lawmakers should reassess how funds are allocated, putting dollars where they matter most. 
Roads connect people and allow Michiganders to take their kids to child care or school, get to the doctor’s office, go grocery shopping and enjoy all of the beauty that Michigan’s parks, lakes and forests provide. We need to know not only where this money is going, but where it is going to be taken from.

Traducción por Jorge Alatrista, Identidad Latina Multimedia.

Desde los primeros días del segundo mandato del presidente Donald Trump, los líderes educativos de Connecticut han observado cómo la administración presidencial implementaba una serie de órdenes ejecutivas, recortes de fondos y cambios en la política federal, muchos de los cuales representan cambios drásticos para los estudiantes, las escuelas y los distritos que supervisan.
Los legisladores de Connecticut han expresado abiertamente su temor al peor escenario posible: una reducción o eliminación total de los 550 millones de dólares en fondos federales de los que depende el estado para apoyar la educación pública K-12.
Por ahora, los fondos se mantienen prácticamente intactos. Sin embargo, varias de las acciones de Trump hasta la fecha — en temas como la DEI (diversidad, equidad e inclusión), estudiantes transgénero y protestas en campus — amenazan con recortes en los fondos federales si las escuelas y universidades no cumplen.
Esto es lo que sabemos hasta ahora.
Diversidad, equidad e inclusión
Durante la primera semana del mandato del presidente Trump, emitió una orden que prohíbe la DEI en todas las agencias federales. La semana siguiente, el presidente emitió una orden ejecutiva para eliminar el trato discriminatorio y el adoctrinamiento, incluyendo los basados ​​en la ideología de género y la ideología discriminatoria de equidad, en las escuelas primarias y secundarias, solicitando reducciones en la financiación federal para las escuelas que no cumplan.
A principios de este mes, el problema se agravó cuando el Departamento de Educación envió una carta instando a los funcionarios educativos estatales de todo el país, a que certificaran su cumplimiento de sus obligaciones antidiscriminatorias para continuar recibiendo asistencia financiera federal. 
Esta semana, Connecticut anunció que no cumplirá con las demandas de terminar con las prácticas de diversidad, equidad e inclusión en sus escuelas K-12, una decisión que probablemente pondrá al estado en un enfrentamiento con la administración Trump.
El Departamento de Defensa también ha suspendido las admisiones con enfoque racial en las academias militares, incluyendo la Academia de la Guardia Costera en New London. En febrero, el Departamento de Educación emitió una carta amenazando con retener la financiación a las instituciones educativas que consideran la raza en sus admisiones y programas. A mediados de marzo, la Universidad de Yale se encontraba entre las docenas de universidades incluidas en un comunicado del Departamento de Educación, que alegaba prácticas excluyentes en las admisiones de posgrado.
Desmantelamiento del Departamento
A principios de marzo, el Departamento de Educación anunció que reduciría su plantilla aproximadamente a la mitad. El Fiscal General de Connecticut, William Tong, se unió a un grupo de estados para demandar a la administración por los recortes de personal, y el caso está pendiente.
El 20 de marzo, el presidente Trump firmó una orden ejecutiva que exigía el desmantelamiento del Departamento de Educación. Los sindicatos de docentes presentaron rápidamente una demanda para bloquear la orden, y los miembros de la delegación del Congreso de Connecticut se han comprometido a tomar medidas. Trump ha declarado que la administración de los préstamos estudiantiles se transferiría a la Administración de Pequeñas Empresas (SBA) y que los programas de necesidades especiales se transferirían al Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos (HHS).
Financiación en la era del COVID-19
El año pasado, los distritos escolares de todo el país solicitaron prórrogas para gastar los últimos dólares restantes de la ayuda federal para el COVID-19 antes de marzo de 2026, en lugar de la fecha límite original de enero de 2025. Sin embargo, a finales de marzo, la administración Trump congeló dicha financiación.
Los últimos 14 millones de dólares de Connecticut se destinaron principalmente a programas del Departamento de Educación Estatal, y poco más de 6 millones de dólares de los fondos ya se habían otorgado a aproximadamente dos docenas de distritos escolares de primaria y secundaria. Se esperaba que New London y Waterbury recibieran la mayor parte de esos fondos.
El gobierno también ha declarado su intención de recortar la financiación de las escuelas y universidades que exigen la vacunación contra el COVID-19.
Estudiantes transgénero
Durante su primera semana en el cargo, el presidente Trump emitió una orden que ponía fin a las protecciones del Título IX para estudiantes transgénero. La semana siguiente, el Departamento de Educación acató la orden, derogando las normas establecidas durante el gobierno de Biden. Posteriormente, el gobierno de Trump emitió una orden ejecutiva que prohíbe a las mujeres y niñas transgénero competir en deportes femeninos. Las instituciones que no cumplan con la prohibición podrían ver recortada su financiación, según ha declarado el gobierno.
A finales de marzo, el departamento envió una carta a los estados amenazando con retener la financiación federal si no se permitía a los padres revisar los expedientes estudiantiles, en particular los relacionados con la identidad de género del estudiante. En Connecticut, defensores de la educación buscan mayor protección para los estudiantes transgénero tras las medidas de la administración Trump.
Control migratorio
En enero, el presidente anunció que los agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) y la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP) podrían realizar arrestos en escuelas, iglesias y hospitales, lugares que durante mucho tiempo se habían considerado “sitios sensibles” y a los que se les había prohibido el acceso a las autoridades migratorias.
Las autoridades educativas de Connecticut publicaron una guía para las escuelas públicas, desde Preescolar hasta el último año del Secundario, sobre cómo los líderes de los distritos locales deben responder a las “actividades migratorias”, incluyendo los casos en que los funcionarios federales de inmigración soliciten información estudiantil o ingresen a las instalaciones escolares.
Comidas escolares
Se cancelaron millones de dólares en fondos previstos que las escuelas y los bancos de alimentos de Connecticut planeaban utilizar para comprar alimentos frescos a agricultores locales. El Departamento de Agricultura de EE.UU. informó a las agencias estatales que dejaría de operar los dos programas que gastan mil millones de dólares anuales a nivel nacional: el Programa de Acuerdo Cooperativo de Asistencia para la Compra de Alimentos Locales y el programa de Alimentos Locales para las Escuelas.
Protestas en los campus universitarios
A finales de enero, el presidente se comprometió a cancelar las visas de estudiante de “todos los simpatizantes de Hamas en los campus universitarios”. Semanas después, el Departamento de Educación advirtió a 60 universidades que podrían enfrentar repercusiones si no “protegen a los estudiantes judíos en sus campus”. La Universidad de Yale se encontraba entre las instituciones mencionadas en el anuncio del Departamento. Varios estudiantes internacionales que participaron en las protestas han sido detenidos.

TUSCALOOSA — When Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum visited two Warrior Met coal mines in central Alabama last week, he said he was emphasizing the administration’s commitment to “clean, beautiful coal” and its plans to roll back regulation.
The department’s press office swiftly posted on social media after the trip his ultimate goal: “Mine, Baby, Mine!”
What Burgum didn’t mention on Friday was Warrior Met Coal’s checkered safety and environmental record, which includes thousands of federal safety violations issued under both Republican and Democratic administrations. He also didn’t mention the death of Aaron Haley, a 34-year-old miner killed on the job in 2023 because, according to an investigative report by federal safety officials, Warrior Met did not keep equipment in safe operating condition.

Missing, too, from Burgum’s comments was any recognition that the coal produced by Warrior Met, metallurgical coal, is not used to power American homes or businesses. Instead, it is shipped abroad through the Port of Mobile, largely to countries in South America and Asia for steelmaking.
“Through these tours, Secretary Burgum is displaying the importance of President Trump’s executive orders which are Unleashing American Energy and putting hardworking Americans first,” a press release from Burgum’s office said after the trip. “Friday’s visit highlights the Department of the Interior’s continued focus on bolstering domestic coal production to create more jobs, lower the cost of living for Americans, and unlock more of our nation’s critical resources.”
Neither Inside Climate News nor other local news outlets contacted by ICN were notified of Burgum’s visit ahead of time. A national reporter for Fox Business was on site for the trip with access to the cabinet secretary.
The Department of the Interior has not responded to questions about the trip or why local reporters were not included. It did not address Warrior Met’s safety or environmental record. Warrior Met has not responded to questions about Burgum’s visit or its own environmental and safety record.

According to the department, Burgum’s first stop was Warrior Met Mine No. 4. The mine utilizes the longwall method of extraction where coal is sheared by large high-powered machinery, leaving behind vast open expanses underground that can lead to the permanent sinking of the land above. The method is faster and can be riskier than other forms of mining and has been blamed for methane leaks.
In March 2024, an Alabama grandfather was killed by an explosion in his home above Oak Grove mine, a longwall operation in nearby Jefferson County, after methane gas likely leaked into the home,
This month, just days before President Donald Trump boasted from the White House about “unleashing…clean, beautiful coal,” a West Virginia woman was severely injured from a blast at her home above a longwall mine.
On April 5, she lit a cigarette, setting off an explosion that first responders suspect was caused by a methane leak from the mine, owned by Core Natural Resources, a Pennsylvania company created by the merger in January of CONSOL Energy and Arch Resources. An investigation is continuing by state inspectors who have ordered the company to submit a revised permit for monitoring methane emissions.
Coal helped turn the United States into a global economic and military power, but coal-fired power plants emit toxic air pollution and heat-trapping gases that are changing the world’s climate in dangerous ways. Moreover, the methane that coal mining releases is a super-pollutant 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at warming the planet over a 20-year period. Inside mines, methane also presents deadly explosion risks to miners if safety measures are not followed.
Contrary to Trump and Burgum’s clean coal assertions, coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels.
Warrior Met’s No. 4 mine has had a history of safety violations, according to records maintained by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), the federal regulator charged with ensuring miner wellbeing.
Since 2019, the mine has been cited by federal regulators nearly 3,000 times with safety violations. About 25 percent—731 of those violations—were labelled by MSHA as “significant and substantial,” meaning the violations were “reasonably likely to result in a serious injury or illness.” More than 100 citations have been issued since Trump took office.
﻿
Records show that the No. 4 Mine is currently undergoing two spot inspections and a “regular safety and health inspection,” investigations that have resulted so far in 25 citations. The mine’s previous complete safety and health inspection, conducted in January, February and March, resulted in 78 citations, according to regulatory records.
Less than two years ago, Aaron Haley, a West Virginia native and father of three, was killed while working inside the No. 4 Mine. An MSHA investigation into the incident faulted the mine for his death and injuries suffered by two other miners.
“On August 30, 2023, at approximately 6:50 a.m., Aaron Haley, a 34-year-old belt foreman with over 13 years of mining experience, died when a longwall belt conveyor take-up unit (take-up) component, the bridle, broke and struck him,” the report said. “The accident occurred because the mine operator did not maintain components of the take-up in safe operating condition.”
Haley’s obituary offers a more expansive sense of what was lost that day: “Aaron was kind, loving, generous, funny and would give the shirt off his back to anyone. He loved teaching [his son] baseball, football, fishing, and just ‘guy’ stuff. His two baby girls…had him wrapped around their fingers. He loved playing kitchen, restaurant and pushing them on their swings. Aaron loved his wife…dearly and took the best care of her. He was the absolute best husband, father, son, and an all-around wonderful man.”
MSHA cited Warrior Met with a violation of 30 CFR 75.1725(a), a regulation requiring that equipment “be maintained in safe operating condition.” If machinery is deemed unsafe, the regulation requires it be removed from service immediately. Since Haley’s death, the No. 4 Mine has been cited nearly 39 times for violating the same safety requirement.
Burgum’s visit to the No. 4 mine was followed, according to his department’s press release, by a “windshield tour” of Warrior Met’s planned Blue Creek facility, which is slated to be one of the largest coal mining expansions in the state’s history.

If approved by state and federal regulators, the project is expected to increase Warrior Met’s coal production by up to 60 percent. Taxpayer-funded support for the facility may top $400 million.
Warrior Met’s planned expansion at Blue Creek may also include the extraction of publicly-owned coal managed by the Bureau of Land Management, according to federal documents.
In Alabama, as in many other states, so-called “mineral rights”—including the right to mine for coal under property—have been separated from surface ownership over time. One person or entity can own a surface property under Alabama law while another person or entity can own the rights to all of the resources below that same piece of land, a situation known as a “split estate.” In significant areas of Alabama, the federal government retains mineral rights despite private land ownership on the surface.
The federal Bureau of Land Management announced in April that it would conduct an environmental assessment related to Warrior Met’s Blue Creek project and, specifically, its proposal to mine 14,040 acres of federal minerals underlying privately owned land in Tuscaloosa County. Warrior Met’s applications to lease the coal rights propose the extraction of approximately 57.5 million tons of recoverable public coal reserves.
Taxpayers will help to pay for some critical needs related to the expansion of the Blue Creek project, according to state and county officials who touted the expansion as leading to job creation. In March 2024, Gov. Kay Ivey announced that, with the support of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, the Appalachian Regional Commission would provide $500,000 in taxpayer funding to install public water service to the Blue Creek mine site. “Access to dependable local water service is essential to attract and grow new business and jobs,” Ivey said.

Warrior Met also secured a $26.5 million tax abatement from the Tuscaloosa County Industrial Development Authority. A breakdown of the tax incentive deal in 2020 estimated that Warrior Met would receive $18 million in tax breaks during the project’s construction and $8.5 million over the next decade.
“This project represents a significant investment in our community by Warrior Met Coal,” said Mark Crews, chairman of the Tuscaloosa County Industrial Development Authority, “but also represents valuable job opportunities for our citizens for several decades to come.”
Exports from Warrior Met and other Alabama coal producers are also a driving force behind continued expansion at the Port of Mobile, including the publicly-funded dredging of Mobile Bay, which is slated to cost taxpayers more than $350 million.
Warrior Met has been the target of litigation over its environmental record. In September 2024, Black Warrior Riverkeeper, an environmental group founded to protect and restore the Black Warrior River and its tributaries, settled a lawsuit with the company over a leaking coal slurry impoundment at Warrior Met’s No. 7 Mine in Brookwood. Black Warrior Riverkeeper had documented nearly two dozen leaks from the coal waste pond in the year before the suit was filed, the organization said in a court filing earlier this year.
The settlement, approved by a federal judge in September of last year, requires Warrior Met to limit and monitor leaks from the site, pay $250,000 to the Freshwater Land Trust for a conservation project and reimburse the nonprofit for its legal fees.
Burgum said last week that metallurgical coal like that extracted by Warrior Met is “essential for us for steelmaking,” though the company itself has acknowledged its coal is not used for steelmaking in the United States. “Substantially all of our steelmaking coal sales are exported,” the company wrote in its 2024 annual report to shareholders.
In the same report, Warrior Met outlined various risks and uncertainties that could impact their bottom line. Among them: “Challenges associated with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations” and “climate change concerns and our operations’ impact on the environment.”

(Allison Kite/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Wyandotte County District Court judge pointed to flaws in Kansas’ capital punishment law in an opinion that didn’t lead to findings relative to a constitutional challenge because the death penalty was taken off the table in both cases creating legal standing for the case.
Judge Bill Klapper’s opinion delved into economic, fairness and psychological elements of capital punishment and examined claims the death penalty statute was biased against defendants of color, fostered trauma among families of victims who dealt with years of proceedings and promoted expenditure of millions of dollars by prosecutors pursuing a sentence the state hadn’t enforced in 60 years.
The constitutional challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations came to an end once their clients accused of capital crimes no longer faced the ultimate punishment.
“The impossibility of either defendant being subjected to the death penalty causes them to lose their legal standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Kansas death penalty as applied to them,” Klapper’s order said.
The ACLU, ACLU of Kansas, the Kansas Death Penalty Defense Unit, Democracy Forward and lawyers from Washington, D.C., law firms filed motions challenging the death penalty on behalf of Antoine Fielder, who was accused of shooting to death Wyandotte County Deputies Theresa King and Patrick Rohrer in June 2018 while being escorted to a court hearing. In exchange for prosecutors withdrawing a request for the death penalty, Fielder entered in December a plea of guilty to two counts of capital murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.
The second participant in the constitutional challenge was Hugo Villaneuva-Morales, who was accused of killing four people in October 2019 at a bar in Kansas City, Kansas. In February, prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty against Villaneuva-Morales in exchange for his waiver of the right to a jury trial. He was found guilty of murder on Wednesday.
Because both men no longer faced the potential of execution, the district court judge didn’t rule on broad constitutional claims relative to the case. With addition of Fielder and Villaneuva-Morales, the ACLU has represented four clients in legal challenges to the state’s death penalty.
“The evidentiary hearings have consistently exposed uncomfortable truths to state prosecutors, the courts and the public about the deep flaws and injustices embedded in the death penalty system,” said Cassandra Stubbs, director of the ACLU’s Capital Punishment Project.
On Thursday, Stubbs said judicial issues brought to light in the series of legal challenges should be recognized by lawmakers in Kansas.
“We remain committed to challenging the death penalty on behalf of people facing capital charges in Kansas with the hope that state legislators will end the death penalty and make future legal challenges unnecessary,” she said.
 
The evidence
In Wyandotte County District Court, testimony portrayed capital punishment as unconstitutional in terms of the right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment and a violation of equal protection rights associated with race and gender. The legal coalition challenging Kansas’ death penalty law additionally asserted jury selection in capital cases, in which all jurors must be willing to impose a death sentence, was unconstitutional.
Witnesses called on behalf of Fielder and Villaneuva-Morales argued the automatic striking of prospective jurors who didn’t believe execution to be a valid form of punishment was discriminatory against Black people, women and individuals with firmly held religious beliefs.
Klapper’s 15-page opinion summarized evidence offered by half the 13 expert witnesses called by attorneys for the two men accused of murder. The state cross-examined most of those witnesses, but didn’t present testimony. The judge said evidence presented on behalf of the two defendants “was decidedly persuasive and well-reasoned.”
He portrayed race and gender as key elements in how prosecutors decided to pursue the death penalty and how those cases were handled by juries. In Kansas, none of 15 men sentenced to death killed a Black person despite Black males making up more than 30% of homicide victims. White females comprised 20% of homicide victims in Kansas, but cases with white female victims were most likely to lead to a death sentence.
“The factors which distinguish death sentence cases from non-death sentence cases are the race and gender of the victim, and the race and gender of the defendant,” the judge’s opinion said.
Klapper drew from an expert witness for the two men who argued the legal framework for selecting jurors was “so flawed that it does not protect racial biases in jury selection and must be reformed, a fact known to Kansans for years.”
The judge wrote that testimony indicated the “scientific community has found no reliable evidence of the death penalty being a deterrent to homicides.”
 
‘Painful wounds’
Hearings in the case, which began in October, showed Kansas prosecutors had filed 129 capital murder cases in response to more than 4,000 homicides committed in the state since the state restored the death penalty in 1994. Prosecutors took the next step to provide formal notice the death penalty would be sought in 76 of those cases.
Of 15 men sentenced to death in Kansas, nine remained under sentences of death. Four of them were resentenced to long prison terms, while two died in prison.
“Much more difficult to measure, but most concerning is the impact continual court hearings have on the victims’ families,” Klapper wrote. “The verdict in a capital case resulting in a death sentence is not the end but only the beginning of the appellate process. Most of the Kansas death penalty cases have been pending for more than 15 years and no (inmate) has exhausted their appellate rights.
“How will families of the victims ever begin to heal and attempt the process of recovery, if that is even possible, when the legal system continues to reopen those painful wounds with each new motion?”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_9082-scaled-e1730240913469-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-17 12:22:33.420917

That’s because of the most recent announcement of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.,"Aerial shot of the NIOSH campus in Bruceton, Allegheny County. (Photo from the CDC)Most Americans learned what an N95 mask was during the COVID-19 pandemic. But what many still don’t know is that every one of them was certified by a single, government-run lab in Bruceton, Allegheny County. It’s called the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. The name N95 actually comes from their certification standards.
The lab, near Pittsburgh, is operated by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) and is the only facility in the country that is capable of offering the agency’s stamp of approval. The same lab certifies a host of other protective masks and respirators used by firefighters, doctors, painters, factory workers, coal miners, pharmaceutical manufacturers, welders, chemical plant employees, construction crews and others. Many American employers are statutorily required to provide them to workers.
An estimated 5 million Americans workers are required to use respirators at their place of employment.
But according to a dozen current and former NIOSH employees and union representatives who have worked at or with their personal protective equipment division, that lab has halted almost all of its regular work and is preparing to shut down in June.
That’s because of the most recent announcement of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency, run by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees across its various divisions. Hundreds of those cuts are in NIOSH, the division that studies and recommends ways to prevent workplace health and safety hazards.
“It’s kind of the sabotage of guide rails that have been set up for industry to help keep workers safe,” said Jonathan Szalajda, a lab employee and former deputy director of the National Personal Protective Technology Lab. “It’s a situation where we’re leaving workers defenseless, and I think it’s certainly a step back from what we’ve done to protect workers over the last half century.”

Since the beginning of mass layoffs at federal agencies overseen by the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), virtually every employee at the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory has taken a buyout or early retirement offer, been put on administrative leave, or received a notice that their job is subject to what’s called a “reduction in force” and that their last day will come in June. 
It’s not clear if the impending layoffs will hit every remaining employee because, according to workers and union officials, leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control have not been answering questions. Moreover, almost all of the lab’s supervisors have been placed on administrative leave, along with their HR contact.
The reduction in force notices are confusing as well. Some sent out to individual employees note that layoffs will happen in their division, and they may or may not be subject to them. But another sent to the union that oversees the bargaining unit employees at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab said all of their jobs would be eliminated. Virtually every lab employee that isn’t part of that union has already been placed on leave or told their position will be terminated in June.
Given the lack of communication, and the sweeping layoffs that have hit other parts of the federal government, including NIOSH itself, employees at the personal protective equipment division are expecting the worst.
Already, the lab’s workforce has shrunk from 120 to 70 this year, and the remaining employees are facing layoffs that the Department of Health and Human Services says will come in June.
A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referred questions to the Department of Health and Human Services, which did not respond to multiple inquiries from the Capital-Star. NIOSH is a research agency within the CDC, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
“We have no idea what we’re supposed to do,” said one remaining lab employee who spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “We have no idea what to tell the manufacturers. This is so important, we just feel there’s no way this can be real.”
Szalajda said the lab has stopped accepting requests from manufacturers to certify new respirators. The remaining lab employees who weren’t laid off have shifted their focus to preparing for the lab to be shut down.
New research has also stopped because of time constraints and a freeze on federal employee credit cards that has made it impossible to buy necessary materials.
Instead, workers are finalizing research projects that are near completion, and preparing them for publication.
‘Someone will have to own the travesty’
Szalajda and others have said they expect the lab’s closure to result in the market being flooded with substandard masks.
Along with certifying new products, lab employees regularly inspect respirator manufacturing plants and test masks that have already been approved to ensure they’re still being manufactured to NIOSH standards. That work, however, has stopped, largely because of a freeze on approval of employee travel reimbursement. According to Szalajda, the lab has also stopped sending out contractors because they’re not certain they’ll ever be paid given the rapid changes.
Szalajda worries about “a Wild West scenario” where respirator manufacturers are free to cut corners in production, and no one will be there to catch them.










One of the last research projects that lab employees are working to finalize is a comprehensive study on the efficacy of counterfeit masks. It’s unclear if the report will ever be released to the public. 


“The American public, if you’re buying a respirator or a mask to do home improvements or hobbies or anything, you’re going to be at the mercy of those companies to not become lax,” said Linda Chasko, a NIOSH employee who was speaking in her capacity as vice president of the federal employees union that includes the Allegheny County NIOSH campus employees.
The potential closure has also alarmed industry members, who have spent significant time and money ensuring their respirators meet NIOSH standards, and rely on the certification for new products.
The closure of the lab could also cede the respirator market to foreign companies whose products are tested according to their own government’s standards. NIOSH certification, however, had often been referred to as a “gold standard,” Szalajda said.  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, KN95 masks were often billed as an alternative to N95s, which were at times difficult to find. The primary difference is that KN95s were certified in China. However, issues were found with a number of certified KN95s, which led to numerous recalls.
There is also a fear that counterfeit masks will spread. Part of the Personal Protective Technology Lab’s mission was to find and study respirators with fake NIOSH-approval stamps, and work with distributors to stop their spread.
One of the last research projects that lab employees are working to finalize is a comprehensive study on the efficacy of counterfeit masks. They found that virtually all of them failed to consistently meet NIOSH standards for filtering air particulates. Between an HHS communications freeze and uncertainty that the report can be finalized before the lab closes, it’s unclear if the report will ever be released to the public.
“We’re expecting there could potentially be an influx of counterfeit equipment,” said Chasko. “What’s at stake is the respiratory health and overall health of all the workers in industries that use equipment reliant on NIOSH standards.”
The lab’s closure could also cause problems for certain industries, like coal, where companies are statutorily required to provide NIOSH-certified respirators for miners. It’s unclear what will happen if NIOSH is no longer able to provide that certification.

For example, every underground coal mine is required by law to provide specialized respirators called closed-circuit escape respirators. They’re for the worst case scenario: escaping a deadly and low-oxygen environment where something has likely gone very wrong.
Those respirators are not just approved by NIOSH, but regularly audited by the lab to ensure they still work after being stored in harsh underground conditions with heavy dust exposure. The same masks are also required in certain Navy ships.
“We have found failures,” one employee said about their regular audits.
Personal protective equipment researchers in Morgantown, West Virginia, the other NIOSH office where research on respirators and protective gear is done, were also hit with layoffs.
One Morgantown NIOSH employee who worked with the personal protective equipment team on firefighter safety recommendations was notified on April 1 that they would immediately be placed on administrative leave. That will end with their termination on June 1. 
Still, they’re hoping the decision will be reversed, and requested anonymity for fear of being targeted in the event that some employees are brought back.
“We were told it was just going to be a consolidation … that the scientists would not be let go,” the employee said about the layoffs, which have affected almost everyone at the Morgantown NIOSH campus. “But the scientists went in the first round.”
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the federal employee union that represents the Morgantown NIOSH employees, said almost all work at the division has stopped, with almost everyone put on administrative leave ahead of terminations in June. 
“You wouldn’t believe how confusing it’s been,” Tinney-Zara said. She said leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have not been communicating with union officials. She can’t even provide an exact number of workers who have been told they’re being laid off.
Mostly, she gets updates through the news like everyone else. Most recently, U.S. Rep. Riley Moore, a West Virginia Republican, said some of the layoffs at the Morgantown facility, which does extensive work on coal miner safety, were made in error. But Tinney-Zara hasn’t been able to confirm that or find out where he got that information.
“It’s a real tragedy,” Szalajda said about the lab’s closure and cuts at NIOSH. “For people who work in this business, it’s not just the paycheck. It’s a lifestyle. People who have been involved within our division, they work there because of a mission, the attractiveness of doing something that makes a difference in people’s lives.”
But Szalajda is hopeful that HHS may still reverse course. He and other employees are waging something of a pressure campaign by reaching out to lawmakers, industry partners and media.
Moreover, he believes that even if the lab, or most of NIOSH, is shut down now, one day it will be replaced. But it may be a hard learning curve for whoever’s brought in to get it running. He expects many of the most experienced people on staff now, would not return. 
“It’s just kind of a recipe for disaster,” Szalajda said. “It may not be something that happens right away, but there will be some sort of incident that will show the void of what’s been left from stepping away, and someone will have to own the travesty that comes after that.”

“He was always building us up, like helping us all,” said Jacie, a friend of Jaydun’s who lived with him for months in the Albuquerque office building of the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department, where case workers have often housed kids who don’t have foster homes available to them.

“Hearing that he’s gone, it just like broke us, and it took a piece out of us,” she said. Jaydun and Jacie both belonged to a tight-knit group of foster youth — teens who had spent much of their lives in foster care and had spent years held in group facilities. Jaydun loved to draw and was an athletic kid who loved basketball, especially the Los Angeles Lakers — a person whom friends would seek out when they needed someone to talk to.
For this story, Searchlight spoke to six people with direct knowledge of the circumstances of Jaydun’s death. Most of them asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media, or because of sensitivities related to the case.

“He was always building us up, like helping us all,” said Jacie, a friend of Jaydun’s. “Hearing that he’s gone, it just like broke us, and it took a piece out of us.”

In an email, CYFD communications director Andrew Skobinsky wrote that the department could not comment because of confidentiality laws. “We are only authorized to release information when it is determined that abuse or neglect caused a child’s death,” he wrote. “Accordingly, no further information can be provided.”
Jaydun’s death comes after years of promises by CYFD to stop housing its foster youth in group settings and to provide them adequate mental health care — promises that were made as part of the 2020 settlement of a class action lawsuit that claimed the state’s child welfare system was “locking New Mexico’s foster children into a vicious cycle of declining physical, mental and behavioral health.”
Now, half a decade later, CYFD has failed year after year to meet its commitments to those promises, according to independent monitors.
Instead, it has housed children with serious mental and behavioral health needs in youth homeless shelters and its office buildings, where they have been sexually assaulted, injured by armed guards and exposed to fentanyl and other drugs.
“When I go visit a client who is living in these settings, I see their mental health declining sharply,” said Sara Crecca, an Albuquerque-based youth attorney who was co-counsel for the plaintiffs of the class action suit.
Amid mounting criticism from attorneys, legislators and advocates, CYFD in June 2024 began moving youth from its office complex to a new building: a former Albuquerque halfway house built for girls transitioning out of juvenile detention.
It was in that building that Jaydun died last weekend, discovered in the bathroom by his roommate, another teenage boy.
The death in itself is beyond tragic, friends and attorneys say — a loss made all the more painful by the fact that CYFD had continued to house Jaydun and other youth in congregate care despite barrages of warnings that such housing was a “clear and urgent safety risk for children,” particularly those who were suffering mental crises, with staffing shortages sometimes leaving kids with nowhere to turn.
“They’re supposed to be the one people that we trust, the ones that we go to when we have problems,” Jacie said of CYFD. In the wake of Jaydun’s death, nobody from the department had reached out to Jacie to offer therapy or counseling, she said.
“If they really cared, they would be on top of getting us therapy. They would be on top of us having a home — a forever home, an actual home with parents’ love — not removing us, not putting us in shelters, not putting us in the office. We’re not getting that.”
Still, the events of last weekend felt unexpected to those close to Jaydun.
“CYFD had promised him a lot of support” during the last year, a close acquaintance of his told Searchlight, asking that they not be named because of the sensitive nature of the case. “He seemed to be optimistic about his future.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CYFD2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 12:22:33.420917

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser told a crowd gathered in a Denver high school auditorium Wednesday night that opponents of President Donald Trump’s administration are fighting “to keep America, America.”
Weiser welcomed three of his counterparts from other states — Attorneys General Nick Brown of Washington, Anne Lopez of Hawaii and Aaron Ford of Nevada — for the latest in a series of “community impact hearings” on Trump’s agenda at George Washington High School.
The four are among the 23 elected Democratic attorneys general nationwide who have led the fight against the second Trump administration’s agenda in the courts. Weiser has sued Trump at least a dozen times so far, including challenges to the administration’s attempt to end the 14th Amendment’s protections for birthright citizenship; its sweeping freeze of many federal grant and aid programs; its mass layoffs of federal employees; and its defunding of medical research through the National Institutes of Health.
Weiser said the legal challenges have borne some fruit in the form of preliminary injunctions and other procedural victories, but acknowledged growing alarm over whether “this democratic republic (will) hold.”
“These court victories are important, but more important is everyone’s voice,” Weiser said, encouraging the crowd to join protests like the one that drew 8,000 people to the Colorado Capitol on April 5. “We need to use our voice.”
Wednesday’s event came amid an outcry this week over the fates of more than 200 immigrants deported by the Trump administration to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador, and promises by Trump to send American citizens there next. At least one of the deportees, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members of many others say that they were falsely identified as members of a transnational gang because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team.
The administration has also moved to target hundreds of lawful permanent residents and student visa holders for deportation, including Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student who led pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations at Columbia University, and Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University doctoral student who was detained after writing an op-ed in her student newspaper. Lawyers for Jeanette Vizguerra, a Colorado woman without legal status who was detained by federal authorities last month, have also alleged in court that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement retaliated against Vizguerra for her immigration advocacy work.
“We won’t tolerate people being picked up without any process and shipped to some other country with no recourse,” Weiser told the crowd to applause. “The First Amendment matters, because when you speak, and you speak your truth, you cannot be — in this country — retaliated against for speaking your truth.”
Weiser, serving his second term as attorney general after winning reelection in 2022, is running for Colorado governor in 2026. He faces a tough primary contest against U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, who entered the race last week.
 Constitutional crisis?

Weiser and his fellow attorneys general heard stories from Coloradans personally impacted by the Trump administration’s actions, including federal workers, homelessness service providers and refugee support organizations.
Marya Washburn, a U.S. Forest Service employee, was part of a firefighting team that responded to the Alexander Mountain Fire in Colorado last summer. In February, she was among the 3,400 probationary employees at the agency to receive termination notices from the Trump administration, and although she was reinstated thanks to a court order, that order is set to end on Saturday.
“I’m shaking,” Washburn said as she read from her notes, citing concerns about cuts to firefighting personnel ahead of the 2025 fire season. “I’m angry.”
Trump’s mass layoffs, funding freezes and attempted shutdowns of congressionally-established agencies amount to an unprecedented expansion of executive power that runs contrary to longstanding separation-of-powers principles in the U.S. Constitution. Fears that his administration will defy adverse court rulings have also reached new heights in recent days, especially following its apparent inaction in the face of a 9-0 Supreme Court ruling last week stating the administration must “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.
Brown, elected as Washington attorney general last year, said that the outcomes of some legal challenges to the administration — like the restoration of grant funding that Trump had attempted to freeze — had “for the most part” given him “confidence in our system.” But that confidence is now being tested.
“This is the first time — this week, in the days past — where I think we’re really getting to the precipice of a constitutional crisis,” he said. “And I don’t say that lightly.”
“I don’t have all the answers. I do not know what it means for a president to blatantly disregard what a court says. I don’t think we’re quite there yet,” Brown continued. “But we might be there tomorrow, or next week.”

On a positive note, North Carolina recently expanded Medicaid to provide health insurance coverage to over 600,000 working people within our state. These individuals would otherwise fall short of the income threshold for “regular” Medicaid but surpass the affordability of private health insurance.
However, the situation is dire as Congress has placed the health care of these families and numerous others in North Carolina at risk of being cut. The U.S. House of Representatives has set a target of reducing $880 billion from Medicaid, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences for the healthcare system and jeopardizing the well-being of patients and communities in North Carolina.
As obstetricians and gynecologists, we are deeply concerned about the potentially devastating impact these cuts would have on our patients. Many of them rely on Medicaid for their healthcare needs. These are the individuals and families who have only recently gained access to health insurance through North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion. For many, it marks their first time having health insurance in years.
Medicaid provides more than just appointments; it covers essential medications, vaccinations, prenatal ultrasounds, hospital stays, and surgeries. Without Medicaid, these patients would be unable to receive the necessary care to maintain their health, work, and care for their families.
It is undeniable that losing health insurance does not guarantee immunity from illness. It simply means that individuals without coverage cannot access the assistance they require when they are unwell. For individuals with diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, high blood pressure, or other health conditions, delaying care often results in more severe health complications. This can lead to emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and more costly medical treatments.











No one should have to fear losing their job, home, or even a loved one due to a single illness, all because they lack health insurance.



The patients we encounter who are covered under Medicaid expansion are working diligently to maintain their health, care for their children, and advance their lives. However, they cannot achieve these goals without access to health insurance. Therefore, Medicaid expansion holds immense significance.
No one should have to fear losing their job, home, or even a loved one due to a single illness, all because they lack health insurance. Regrettably, this scenario would unfold if we reverse our progress in Medicaid expansion at the state level.
Cutting Medicaid would have a particularly severe impact on women of childbearing age, many of whom rely on Medicaid coverage to meet their health needs. In fact, nearly half of all births in our state are now covered by Medicaid. North Carolina’s recent Medicaid expansion legislation provided healthcare for many women of childbearing age before they became pregnant. Healthy mothers give birth to healthy babies, so eliminating or reducing Medicaid coverage for these women before they conceive will result in an increase in high-risk births, babies with serious health complications, and subsequently higher medical costs.
Instead of resorting to emergency rooms, we want our patients to have consistent access to healthcare. Removing this coverage from the thousands of women will lead to a perilous rise in preventable health complications and deaths not only in North Carolina but also across the nation.
While Congress deliberates on these cuts, one thing is certain: if Medicaid is cut, not only will women and their families bear the brunt of the consequences, but so will North Carolina. It is not too late for us to collectively raise our voices in support of Medicaid and oppose these steep cuts. We urge our elected officials to push back against these proposed cuts. The lives of our fellow North Carolinians, including many mothers and babies, depend on it.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pregnant-with-IV-Getty-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 12:22:33.420917

It now goes to the House, where GOP leaders are expected to craft a largely separate budget and come to a compromise later.
The plan outlines $32.6 billion in spending for fiscal year 2025-26 and $33.3 billion for 2026-27. It gives modest pay raises to state workers, educators and law enforcement; cuts hundreds of vacant state jobs and some filled ones; and sets aside hundreds of millions for future hurricane relief.
Conservatives in the chamber have praised the spending plan as a safe but confident step in continuing North Carolina’s growth.
“It’s not probably the budget everybody wanted, but it is a good, sound, fiscally responsible budget,” Sen. Brent Jackson (R-Sampson) said Thursday.
Democrats have criticized the budget for lacking extensive investment in key areas, arguing that it fails to put the state and its residents on safe economic ground. And they continued to express frustration about a largely opaque budget process.

“Perhaps invite us to the table next time, and we could talk to you about some of the amendments we have,” Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) told reporters Wednesday evening. “Because you don’t have the corner on the market to good ideas, especially when it comes to North Carolina.”
Batch said Democrats were open to working with any House Republicans who welcomed their input.
The final vote in the Senate on Thursday was 30-15. Sen. Bobby Hanig (R-Currituck), who had an amendment shot down by his Republican colleagues Wednesday, joined Democrats in opposition. Four Democrats, including former Senate Democratic Leader Dan Blue (D-Wake) voted yes.
House budget writers are expected to craft their own plan that differs significantly from the Senate’s. Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters Wednesday evening he had only had discussions with Speaker Destin Hall about top-level spending.

CHICAGO — Red-light camera entrepreneur Omar Maani made a point of not saying much during an April 2019 meeting with state Sen. Emil Jones III, D-Chicago, letting his co-founder and lobbyists for his company SafeSpeed do most of the talking.

But as they dined at a suburban steakhouse two months later, Maani told Jones that he didn’t say “a f------ word the whole time” at their previous meeting because he preferred to discuss business “one-on-one or with an intimate group.”

He then proceeded to talk so much, Jones left the dinner feeling like he’d spent his evening with “a used-car salesman,” the senator told a jury Wednesday as he testified in his own defense at his federal corruption trial.

“He just — he talked a lot,” Jones said after his attorney, Vic Henderson, asked what the senator meant. “He repeated himself over and over again and ... I don’t know, just like I said, he reminded me of a used-car salesman.”

But instead of a clunker, Maani was trying to sell Jones on the idea of changing legislation he’d introduced in Springfield that called for a statewide study on red-light camera systems. The senator had sponsored a few similar bills in the past, and though they hadn’t gotten close to becoming law, Maani was worried that a study would eventually lead to a ban on the technology, threatening his business.

A few months after that June 2019 dinner, Jones told FBI agents he’d felt uncomfortable as Maani and his colleague, then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago, hinted at benefits Sandoval received from Maani.

As it turned out, Sandoval received approximately $75,000 in cash from Maani — but only because Maani was cooperating with the FBI, which provided him with the money. As the trio ate their meals, Maani had the latest installment sitting in his jacket pocket.

But Jones didn’t know that yet. When Sandoval turned to Jones during their dinner and told him that Maani “wants to be your friend,” though, he started getting the picture.

“So what did you think he meant by, ‘He wants you to be his friend?’” FBI Special Agent Nijika Rustagi asked Jones as she and her partner interviewed him in his home on Sept. 24, 2019.

“Well, two things,” the senator answered. “One, you know, he wants to donate to my campaign, or two, he wants to, you know, give me cash.”

‘That’s why I never called him back’

Jones didn’t make any specific promises at the dinner, but did repeat what he’d said when he visited SafeSpeed’s offices in April: he’d been hearing fewer complaints about red-light cameras from his constituents lately, and believed that Chicago’s red-light camera program was more of a problem than systems in the suburbs, where SafeSpeed operated.

The senator was willing to limit his legislation to only study red-light cameras in Chicago, but he still wanted a statewide look at the systems. And though he was wary of both Maani and Sandoval, Jones said he believed he had to work with them to get his bill passed by negotiating something they all could live with, he testified Wednesday.

When Jones and Maani met for another dinner the following month, Maani cut to the chase.

“So let me ask you this: In an ideal world, how much would you want me to come up with or raise or what have you for it?” Maani asked of Jones’ upcoming fundraiser.  “You tell me a number.”

“I don’t give folks numbers,” Jones said after a beat. “Just whatever you can raise for me, that’d be nice. I’m not greedy.”

But Maani pressed him, telling the senator he wanted to “meet expectations.” Eventually, between bites of wagyu steak, Jones acquiesced.

“If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good,” the senator said. “But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office,” Jones told Maani. “And I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job.”

Prosecutors pinpointed this moment in Maani’s secretly recorded footage of his and Jones’ July 17, 2019, dinner as the instant Jones named his price for a bribe to change his legislation — the basis for two of the charges the senator is fighting in court.

The third count alleges Jones lied to the FBI about the purported bribes on another secret recording played for the jury Tuesday. When the agents arrived at Jones’ home on Chicago’s far South Side on that September morning, they told him they were investigating Sandoval, which was true; a host of other federal agents would execute search warrants on the senator’s offices and home later that day.

(Capitol News Illinois file photo)[/caption]

But they didn’t tell Jones that he was also under investigation.

During the interview, FBI Special Agent Timothy O’Brien asked Jones whether Maani directly propositioned him for a bribe.

“Did Omar say like, ‘Hey, you know, what’s it gonna take?’” O’Brien asked. “Did you guys come up with an amount that he was going to donate for a fundraiser or anything like that?”

“No, no, no,” Jones answered. “He just asked, ‘How much do you want me to raise?’ I said, “Whatever you want to raise. Whatever you can do, you know?’”

From the witness stand Wednesday — more than 5 ½ years later — the senator explained why he told the agents that he and Maani hadn’t come up with a number.

“Because we didn’t,” Jones said. “When I said to him, ‘You can raise me five grand,’ that’s anywhere between zero and five thousand.”

After Jones denied settling on a number with Maani, the agents told him they knew he suggested $5,000 to Maani and they knew “about those conversations you had with Sandoval about how much.” Jones’ former colleague began cooperating with the government and pleaded guilty to bribery and tax fraud but can’t be called for testimony in Jones’ trial because he died in late 2020.

While the money never materialized and Jones never ended up amending his legislation according to Maani’s wishes, prosecutors say that doesn’t matter. The senator’s former intern, then-23-year-old Christopher Katz, did end up getting paid by Maani for a six-week period before the FBI’s red-light camera probe went public with their raids the same day O’Brien and Rustagi showed up to Jones’ house.

Jones acknowledged to the agents that he knew Maani was suggesting something illegal when he repeatedly told the senator that he’d like to come up with a “creative” way to contribute the $5,000 but emphasized that he was never going to accept money from Maani.

“That’s why I never called him back,” the senator told the agents.

“But yet he hired your intern, which could be construed that he’s helping you out,” O’Brien said.

“Could it?” Jones asked. “I mean, I do that all the time. You know, recommend people who are asking for jobs.”

On Wednesday, the senator explained that he’d answered O’Brien’s question with another question “because I didn’t look at it that way — as him (Maani) hiring my intern as a benefit to me.”

‘My only concern was getting him a job’

A little later in the FBI interview, Jones acknowledged that Maani told him the previous month that he’d put Katz on his payroll even though he didn’t have any work for him to do. He thought Maani had essentially hired Katz “as his personal assistant.”

“Because you asked him to,” Rustagi said.

“Yeah, but not in exchange for — ” Jones replied before Rustagi cut him off, telling the senator that she knew what he and Maani talked about at their July dinner at Steak 48, Jones’ favorite Chicago steakhouse.

On Wednesday, Jones tried to explain that moment in hindsight.

“It seemed like she was trying to accuse me of hiring my intern in exchange for changing legislation,” Jones said, adding that the notion was “definitely untrue.”

“Me asking for employment (for Katz) had nothing to do with the legislation,” he said.

The senator explained that as he was making his way to the dinner with Maani, Katz’s mother “called me crying.”

“She really, really needed him to have a job — is there anything I can do to help facilitate him getting a job?” Jones recalled.

Katz had previously worked two different stints in the senator’s district office, but in the summer of 2019, Jones said he didn’t have room in his budget to hire another intern.

But he remembered that on his April visit to SafeSpeed’s headquarters, he learned the company hired dozens of college students to review red-light camera footage to determine whether a violation occurred and should be sent to the local police chief of the camera’s host municipality for final approval and ticketing.

Jones believed it would be a ""good fit” for Katz, and at first Maani agreed. But during another dinner in August 2019, Maani told him that he had reservations about recommending SafeSpeed hire someone connected with Jones.

In testimony last week, Maani told the jury he believed it would have looked “really goofy and concerning that we’re now hiring his intern with someone who’s sponsoring negative legislation against us.”

Instead, Maani told Jones at their second Steak 48 dinner that he’d hire Katz to “work directly for me.”

On Wednesday, Jones said it was “none of my business” that Maani wanted to keep Katz’s job a secret from his colleagues.

“My only concern was getting him a job,” Jones said.

Prosecutors last week showed the jury a series of text messages between Jones and Katz in the summer of 2019, which included Katz requesting spending money from Jones and late-night messages from the much-older senator.

“I want to see u after,” Jones texted Katz at 2:17 a.m. after Katz told Jones he was still at a now-defunct strip club in south suburban Harvey, though the two never met up that night.

“And these text messages — tell us about your relationship with Chris,” Henderson directed his client Wednesday. “Put it out there.”

“We’re friends,” Jones said of Katz, though he said they don’t talk all the time. He confirmed that they’d been introduced by Katz’s mother, Linda Redd, who testified the same on Tuesday and lives with her son.

“Me and Chris share a passion for cooking,” Jones said. “I get invited over to their house every once in a while.”

Jones’ testimony differed slightly from Katz, who said on the witness stand last week he didn’t consider Jones a friend. And it differed a bit from testimony given by Redd, who said she’d only seen Jones in person “maybe four” times — mostly at parties where they’d dance together to house music, an electronic dance genre born in 1980s Chicago.

On the night of the extended text exchange with Katz, Jones said he and his former intern had run into each other at the Chosen Few Picnic, an annual all-day house music festival on Chicago’s South Side.

“You can dance?” Henderson asked his client.

“I can do a little something,” Jones replied, garnering a smattering of laughter from the courtroom.

The senator will continue his testimony for a third day on Thursday, likely followed by what prosecutors estimate will be at least a few hours of cross-examination.

CHICAGO — Red-light camera entrepreneur Omar Maani made a point of not saying much during an April 2019 meeting with state Sen. Emil Jones III, D-Chicago, letting his co-founder and lobbyists for his company SafeSpeed do most of the talking.

But as they dined at a suburban steakhouse two months later, Maani told Jones that he didn’t say “a f------ word the whole time” at their previous meeting because he preferred to discuss business “one-on-one or with an intimate group.”

He then proceeded to talk so much, Jones left the dinner feeling like he’d spent his evening with “a used-car salesman,” the senator told a jury Wednesday as he testified in his own defense at his federal corruption trial.

“He just — he talked a lot,” Jones said after his attorney, Vic Henderson, asked what the senator meant. “He repeated himself over and over again and ... I don’t know, just like I said, he reminded me of a used-car salesman.”

But instead of a clunker, Maani was trying to sell Jones on the idea of changing legislation he’d introduced in Springfield that called for a statewide study on red-light camera systems. The senator had sponsored a few similar bills in the past, and though they hadn’t gotten close to becoming law, Maani was worried that a study would eventually lead to a ban on the technology, threatening his business.

A few months after that June 2019 dinner, Jones told FBI agents he’d felt uncomfortable as Maani and his colleague, then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago, hinted at benefits Sandoval received from Maani.

As it turned out, Sandoval received approximately $75,000 in cash from Maani — but only because Maani was cooperating with the FBI, which provided him with the money. As the trio ate their meals, Maani had the latest installment sitting in his jacket pocket.

But Jones didn’t know that yet. When Sandoval turned to Jones during their dinner and told him that Maani “wants to be your friend,” though, he started getting the picture.

“So what did you think he meant by, ‘He wants you to be his friend?’” FBI Special Agent Nijika Rustagi asked Jones as she and her partner interviewed him in his home on Sept. 24, 2019.

“Well, two things,” the senator answered. “One, you know, he wants to donate to my campaign, or two, he wants to, you know, give me cash.”

‘That’s why I never called him back’

Jones didn’t make any specific promises at the dinner, but did repeat what he’d said when he visited SafeSpeed’s offices in April: he’d been hearing fewer complaints about red-light cameras from his constituents lately, and believed that Chicago’s red-light camera program was more of a problem than systems in the suburbs, where SafeSpeed operated.

The senator was willing to limit his legislation to only study red-light cameras in Chicago, but he still wanted a statewide look at the systems. And though he was wary of both Maani and Sandoval, Jones said he believed he had to work with them to get his bill passed by negotiating something they all could live with, he testified Wednesday.

When Jones and Maani met for another dinner the following month, Maani cut to the chase.

“So let me ask you this: In an ideal world, how much would you want me to come up with or raise or what have you for it?” Maani asked of Jones’ upcoming fundraiser.  “You tell me a number.”

“I don’t give folks numbers,” Jones said after a beat. “Just whatever you can raise for me, that’d be nice. I’m not greedy.”

But Maani pressed him, telling the senator he wanted to “meet expectations.” Eventually, between bites of wagyu steak, Jones acquiesced.

“If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good,” the senator said. “But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office,” Jones told Maani. “And I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job.”

Prosecutors pinpointed this moment in Maani’s secretly recorded footage of his and Jones’ July 17, 2019, dinner as the instant Jones named his price for a bribe to change his legislation — the basis for two of the charges the senator is fighting in court.

The third count alleges Jones lied to the FBI about the purported bribes on another secret recording played for the jury Tuesday. When the agents arrived at Jones’ home on Chicago’s far South Side on that September morning, they told him they were investigating Sandoval, which was true; a host of other federal agents would execute search warrants on the senator’s offices and home later that day.

But they didn’t tell Jones that he was also under investigation.

During the interview, FBI Special Agent Timothy O’Brien asked Jones whether Maani directly propositioned him for a bribe.

“Did Omar say like, ‘Hey, you know, what’s it gonna take?’” O’Brien asked. “Did you guys come up with an amount that he was going to donate for a fundraiser or anything like that?”

“No, no, no,” Jones answered. “He just asked, ‘How much do you want me to raise?’ I said, “Whatever you want to raise. Whatever you can do, you know?’”

From the witness stand Wednesday — more than 5 ½ years later — the senator explained why he told the agents that he and Maani hadn’t come up with a number.

“Because we didn’t,” Jones said. “When I said to him, ‘You can raise me five grand,’ that’s anywhere between zero and five thousand.”

After Jones denied settling on a number with Maani, the agents told him they knew he suggested $5,000 to Maani and they knew “about those conversations you had with Sandoval about how much.” Jones’ former colleague began cooperating with the government and pleaded guilty to bribery and tax fraud but can’t be called for testimony in Jones’ trial because he died in late 2020.

While the money never materialized and Jones never ended up amending his legislation according to Maani’s wishes, prosecutors say that doesn’t matter. The senator’s former intern, then-23-year-old Christopher Katz, did end up getting paid by Maani for a six-week period before the FBI’s red-light camera probe went public with their raids the same day O’Brien and Rustagi showed up to Jones’ house.

Jones acknowledged to the agents that he knew Maani was suggesting something illegal when he repeatedly told the senator that he’d like to come up with a “creative” way to contribute the $5,000 but emphasized that he was never going to accept money from Maani.

“That’s why I never called him back,” the senator told the agents.

“But yet he hired your intern, which could be construed that he’s helping you out,” O’Brien said.

“Could it?” Jones asked. “I mean, I do that all the time. You know, recommend people who are asking for jobs.”

On Wednesday, the senator explained that he’d answered O’Brien’s question with another question “because I didn’t look at it that way — as him (Maani) hiring my intern as a benefit to me.”

‘My only concern was getting him a job’

A little later in the FBI interview, Jones acknowledged that Maani told him the previous month that he’d put Katz on his payroll even though he didn’t have any work for him to do. He thought Maani had essentially hired Katz “as his personal assistant.”

“Because you asked him to,” Rustagi said.

“Yeah, but not in exchange for — ” Jones replied before Rustagi cut him off, telling the senator that she knew what he and Maani talked about at their July dinner at Steak 48, Jones’ favorite Chicago steakhouse.

On Wednesday, Jones tried to explain that moment in hindsight.

“It seemed like she was trying to accuse me of hiring my intern in exchange for changing legislation,” Jones said, adding that the notion was “definitely untrue.”

“Me asking for employment (for Katz) had nothing to do with the legislation,” he said.

The senator explained that as he was making his way to the dinner with Maani, Katz’s mother “called me crying.”

“She really, really needed him to have a job — is there anything I can do to help facilitate him getting a job?” Jones recalled.

Katz had previously worked two different stints in the senator’s district office, but in the summer of 2019, Jones said he didn’t have room in his budget to hire another intern.

But he remembered that on his April visit to SafeSpeed’s headquarters, he learned the company hired dozens of college students to review red-light camera footage to determine whether a violation occurred and should be sent to the local police chief of the camera’s host municipality for final approval and ticketing.

Jones believed it would be a ""good fit” for Katz, and at first Maani agreed. But during another dinner in August 2019, Maani told him that he had reservations about recommending SafeSpeed hire someone connected with Jones.

In testimony last week, Maani told the jury he believed it would have looked “really goofy and concerning that we’re now hiring his intern with someone who’s sponsoring negative legislation against us.”

Instead, Maani told Jones at their second Steak 48 dinner that he’d hire Katz to “work directly for me.”

On Wednesday, Jones said it was “none of my business” that Maani wanted to keep Katz’s job a secret from his colleagues.

“My only concern was getting him a job,” Jones said.

Prosecutors last week showed the jury a series of text messages between Jones and Katz in the summer of 2019, which included Katz requesting spending money from Jones and late-night messages from the much-older senator.

“I want to see u after,” Jones texted Katz at 2:17 a.m. after Katz told Jones he was still at a now-defunct strip club in south suburban Harvey, though the two never met up that night.

“And these text messages — tell us about your relationship with Chris,” Henderson directed his client Wednesday. “Put it out there.”

“We’re friends,” Jones said of Katz, though he said they don’t talk all the time. He confirmed that they’d been introduced by Katz’s mother, Linda Redd, who testified the same on Tuesday and lives with her son.

“Me and Chris share a passion for cooking,” Jones said. “I get invited over to their house every once in a while.”

Jones’ testimony differed slightly from Katz, who said on the witness stand last week he didn’t consider Jones a friend. And it differed a bit from testimony given by Redd, who said she’d only seen Jones in person “maybe four” times — mostly at parties where they’d dance together to house music, an electronic dance genre born in 1980s Chicago.

On the night of the extended text exchange with Katz, Jones said he and his former intern had run into each other at the Chosen Few Picnic, an annual all-day house music festival on Chicago’s South Side.

“You can dance?” Henderson asked his client.

“I can do a little something,” Jones replied, garnering a smattering of laughter from the courtroom.

The senator will continue his testimony for a third day on Thursday, likely followed by what prosecutors estimate will be at least a few hours of cross-examination.

(Screenshot from Fort Benning livestream)Fort Benning’s name has officially been restored after a two-year stint as Fort Moore that was part of a national move away from Confederate namesakes.
But the Pentagon says the Army post near the Alabama border is now named for a different Benning – World War I veteran Fred Benning of Nebraska, an Army corporal who enlisted when he was 17 and served in the First Infantry Division.
Originally, Confederate Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning, who fought to preserve slavery, was the Benning being honored.
New signage was unveiled Wednesday during a renaming ceremony at the base, which is one of the country’s largest installations. Fred Benning’s granddaughter was there, sharing memories of her grandfather.
Pentagon moves to restore Fort Bragg name to North Carolina’s Fort Liberty

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed a memo renaming the base last month, saying at the time in a short video statement that “now Fort Benning is back too.”
The move followed the return of Fort Bragg’s name in North Carolina, in that case going with Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, a World War II veteran, as the new namesake instead of Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg. It had been renamed Fort Liberty.
The updated names had been the work of a commission on renaming bases honoring Confederates created by Congress, and that commission was part of a defense authorization bill that had enough support in 2020 to override President Donald Trump’s veto during his first term.
Georgia’s Fort Gordon near Augusta was also renamed as part of that push to Fort Eisenhower in 2023 after World War II Army general and 34th President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The original name had honored John B. Gordon, a major general in the Confederate army who went on to serve as Georgia governor and U.S. senator.
In 2023, Fort Benning had been renamed Fort Moore in honor of Lt. Gen. Hal and Julia Moore. During the Vietnam War, while Hal Moore was deployed, Julia worked to change the way the U.S. military handled death notifications. At the time, they were delivered by cabbies carrying a telegram. The couple is buried at the post’s military cemetery.
Lt. Gen. Moore served in the Korean and Vietnam wars. He is co-author of the book “We Were Soldiers Once … And Young,” about the brutal 1965 battle Moore led in Vietnam’s Ia Drang valley.
“Both Hal and Julia Moore remarkably served our country and raised the standard of excellence in the United States Army for servicemen and civilian spouses alike. I am proud that a military base in Georgia was chosen to bear their name, even briefly,” state Sen. Ed Harbison, a Columbus Democrat and military veteran, said shortly after the renaming was announced.
Others were more critical of the change.
“The American people understand the legacy connected to the original name, and Secretary Hegseth’s disingenuous attempt to associate it to a separate soldier is transparent and distasteful,” Margaret Huang, president and CEO Southern Poverty Law Center, said in response to the news last month.
Maj. Gen. Colin Tuley, who is the commanding general of the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning, said in public remarks Wednesday that Fred Benning’s life will serve as an inspiration for the thousands of soldiers who train there every year.
Fred Benning was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for “extraordinary heroism in action” in 1918 south of Exermont, France. He took command after his platoon commander was killed and two senior non-commissioned officers were injured. When he returned home, he operated a bakery and later served as mayor of Neligh, Nebraska.
“As we rededicate this post in his honor, may we all strive to embody the very same tenets he exemplified: unwavering dedication to people, inspirational leadership, a relentless pursuit of transformation,” Tuley said. “(His) story reminds us that true heroism is not just defined by rank. It is about that unwavering courage, that selfless service and an enduring commitment to something greater than ourselves.”
None of South Carolina’s bases were renamed.

Data from Wax Lake informed coastal restoration plans like the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority voted Wednesday to fully fund its nearly $2 billion spending plan for next fiscal year, despite more than a quarter of that money being tied up in a project that might never happen.
Gov. Jeff Landry ordered a 90-day pause last week on the nearly $3 billion Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, which would direct water and land-building alluvium from the Mississippi River into Barataria Bay. The governor has urged a decrease in the size and scope of the plan because of its expense and potential to adversely affect oyster beds and coastal fisheries 
The 2025-26 fiscal year budget the CPRA approved includes $573 million for the massive sediment diversion. The spending plan goes next to the legislature for final consideration.
The majority of funding for the Mid-Barataria project comes from the nearly $8 billion in settlement money awarded to the state after BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The money is held in a trust overseen by the U.S. Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
Those trustees sent a letter to CPRA executive director Glenn Ledet Jr. in November indicating the $2.26 billion already awarded for the Mid-Barataria diversion would be clawed back should the project stop. That means the state would have to “return those funds for future restoration activities.”
The CPRA testified in an Oct. 2024 state senate hearing to already spending around $519 million on the Mid-Barataria plan pre-construction costs and mitigation measures for communities and wildlife that stand to be impacted. Around $394 million of the money already spent went toward construction costs. 
The diversion project has led to lawsuits and political disputes. A group of environmentalists and Plaquemines Parish business owners has challenged the project in court, arguing federal agencies issued permits without taking into account its impact on aquatic species and fisheries. Plaquemines officials have sued separately, arguing the diversion project will increase flood risks in the parish.
CPRA Chairman Gordy Dove argued at Wednesday’s meeting that approving next year’s budget, despite the diversion project’s uncertainty, was essential to support other developments the authority has in the works. Dove, a former Terrebonne Parish president who Landry appointed in 2024 to lead the authority, has openly balked at the price tag for the major diversion.  
“This isn’t the first time a project has been held up,” Dove said, adding that money could be reallocated from Mid-Barataria to the 149 other projects the CPRA has proposed.
They include the Barataria Land Bridge, a structure made with sand dredged from the Mississippi River. Proponents say it’s a less intrusive alternative to the river diversion, while its detractors insist the benefits will be at a far smaller scale and not as long-lasting.
Other projects in the budget include flood risk management efforts in St. Tammany Parish, barrier Island restoration in Grand Isle and marsh creation projects in Bayou Cane and Lake Borgne.
Dwayne Bourgeois, the CPRA member representing Terrebonne Parish, questioned whether it was appropriate to approve a budget with such a large portion of its spending in limbo.         
“We’re voting on something that has a big gap in it, that’s undetermined. But I think at this point it’s unavoidable,” Bourgeois said, noting the need to provide money for other CPRA work. 
“We’ve got a pipeline running right now of all of these projects … I feel like I’ve got a gun to my head,” he added.
While funding for Mid-Barataria remains in the plan, Dove reiterated there has been “no decision made” on whether the project will get final approval. 
Advocacy groups showed up for the CPRA meeting at the State Capitol to support the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, which is considered the cornerstone project of Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan.
“The state needs this project,” said Amanda Moore, senior director of the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf program. She said the project is “science-based” and “wildly popular” among Louisiana residents. 
Survey results from the advocacy group Restore the Mississippi River Delta released earlier this week show 83% of respondents approve of the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion moving forward. Support for the project was bipartisan among the 800 registered Louisiana voters who responded to the surveys.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8523-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 11:10:23.398612

Avelo came under fire last week after the company said it would fly charter flights carrying deported immigrants on behalf of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Avelo plans to begin operating the deportation flights out of Mesa, Arizona on May 12.
Since then, thousands of people have signed a petition calling for passengers to boycott Avelo. That petition was launched by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition, which has also organized protests against the airline.
Hope Chavez, who is part of the coalition, urged the airport authority’s board members Wednesday to consider putting pressure on the airline to change course.
“Join with the state of Connecticut in lobbying to not renew Avelo’s various subsidies and fuel tax moratoriums that expire this year,” she said. “Take this opportunity to protect your bottom line and to protect the ethics of what it means to be a New Havener.”
The airline enjoys certain public benefits, including a fuel tax exemption from the state, which is set to expire. Some Democratic state lawmakers are exploring avenues to cut future public benefits Avelo receives.
Avelo said its long-term charter program would provide domestic and international trips to support deportation efforts, according to an April 2025 job posting, which has since been taken down.
The airline said operating deportation flights will give it more stability while it expands service and keeps more than 1,100 employees on the payroll.
The Tweed New Haven Airport Authority oversees operations at the airport, which is Avelo’s largest commercial hub.
During a regularly scheduled meeting Wednesday, Robert Reed, the chairman of the authority, didn’t directly address the controversy, but read aloud a prepared remark, which he said was not alluding to anything specific.
“Every airport experiences push and pull dynamics as we balance operations, passenger experience, and the business of running a travel hub,” Reed said. “Tensions between airports and their tenant airlines are not only normal, they are a healthy part of business.”
Avelo flew more than half a million passengers from the airport last year, according to the authority.
Airline spokesperson Courtney Gaff told Connecticut Public in an email that the deportation flights would “offset revenue loss across the airline’s entire network.” She added that the airline flew these types of charters under the Biden administration.
Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat, asked Avelo last week to provide a copy of its contract related to the deportation flights by April 15. The airline declined, however, writing in a letter signed by Avelo CEO Andrew Levy that the contract could be obtained through a request to DHS made under the Freedom of Information Act.
“Avelo remains committed to public safety and the rule of law,” Levy wrote, “as evidenced by our public, continuous, and persistent compliance with all federal regulations governing commercial air travel in the United States.”

(Photo: Courtesy of the Western North Carolina Tenants Network.)Eviction filings are rarely a win for landlords, according to a new research brief by The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) titled, “Beyond Eviction: Landlords as Essential Partners in Housing Stability.”
Despite common perceptions, eviction proceedings seldom result in landlords recovering back rent and often lead to prolonged income loss, the study’s authors said. A single eviction cost landlords, on average, $2,500 to $8,000, they said.
“Even with a court judgment in their favor, landlords struggle to collect the rent they are owed — particularly from tenants with limited financial resources,” the authors said. “Research suggests that fewer than 10 percent of landlords successfully collect all owed back rent after a judgment in their favor.”
For tenants, the eviction process causes them to fall further behind on their rent, face possible homelessness and struggle to find housing and work because of an eviction on their record, the authors said. More than one in three renter households experiences a housing related civil legal issue each year, they said.
The LSC brief is part of a congressionally directed study to investigate the unmet legal needs surrounding eviction in the United States. “Beyond Eviction: Landlords as Essential Partners in Housing Stability” is one of several briefs produced as part of  the study. A final report will serve as the culmination of the study.
Click here to see the Eviction Laws Database to learn more about eviction laws in your state. The interactive map was developed by LSC in partnership with the Center for Public Health Law Research at Temple University. It examines how eviction laws and procedures differ across states and territories—and what those differences mean for tenants, landlords and communities.
Key takeaways of the brief include:

Most eviction filings involve rent-burdened households—people paying over 30% of their income toward housing. More than one-quarter of all rental units in the U.S. are owned by small, “mom-and-pop” landlords who often rely on timely rent to cover expenses. These factors together create a fragile balance.
Despite common perceptions, eviction proceedings rarely result in landlords recovering all rent owed. In fact, filing for eviction is likely to lead to prolonged income loss, greater administrative burdens and additional costs for future tenants.
By working together, landlords and legal aid providers can reduce financial losses, improve stability for all parties and minimize the costs and disruptions of eviction.
When a case does end up in eviction court, legal representation for tenants benefits both parties, as well as the court system. Legal counsel helps to streamline the process, leading to quicker resolutions where all parties understand their obligations.
The brief also highlights partnership strategies that are helping landlords and civil legal aid collaborate to create less contentious paths to stable revenue and build healthier communities. The efforts include providing pre-filing notices, rental assistance programs and eviction diversion and prevention programs.

“By encouraging communication and building trust, legal aid can help both parties find sustainable solutions that avoid costly and disruptive eviction court action,” the authors said.
In North Carolina, 48% of renters are considered cost-burdened because they spend more than 30% of income on housing needs, according to the NC Housing Coalition’s 2025 County Profiles of state housing needs. Meanwhile, 19% of homeowners are cost-burdened. Across the state, 194,526 families faced an eviction filing last year and 11,394 families faced foreclosure, according to the report.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eviction-Rally.jpg,,,2025-04-17 10:18:48.965850

Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, which also has one location in Rhode Island, found out about the pause on March 31.
The funding comes from Title X, which funds sexual and reproductive health care for low-income people. It doesn’t fund abortions.
Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz (D) spoke with advocates at the Capitol on Wednesday. She said Connecticut is one of 23 states impacted.
“Withholding these funds is really an attempt to cut off access to birth control, cancer screenings, STI and STD testing and reproductive health care in general,” Bysiewicz said. “This is a major public health concern.”
HHS told TIME they’re pausing the funding while they review possible violations of civil rights laws and an executive order from President Trump that bars undocumented immigrants from getting taxpayer-funded benefits.
Each of the organizations with grants on hold received a letter explaining the reason for the pause, according to an HHS spokesperson. The letter requested documentation within 10 days to assess compliance with grant terms and conditions.
WSHU asked HHS how long the review would take but did not receive an answer.
Gretchen Raffa, PPSNE’s chief policy and advocacy officer, said the pause would hurt the 41,000 people in Connecticut who rely on Title X funding at her organization.
“This decision will have devastating consequences, especially for Black and Latino communities, women, people living in rural areas, and those living with low incomes, the very communities that already face the highest barriers to care,” Raffa said. “This move will only widen those disparities and make it harder, if not impossible, for many people to get the health care they need and they deserve.”
Last month, Connecticut lawmakers allocated $800,000 to Planned Parenthood, citing federal funding uncertainty.
Bysiewicz said the legislature would continue to assess the situation to determine if further state funding is needed.

Robert Dole.,"Jami Reever, executive director for Kansas Appleseed, said on the 10-year anniversary of a state law restricting access to food program benefits that Kansas ought to honor the legacy of the late U.S. Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kansas, by aligning policy with programs demonstrated to reduce hunger. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The advocacy organization Kansas Appleseed marked the 10th anniversary of the HOPE Act by denouncing the legacy of a state law blamed for undermining food security and work of the late U.S. Sen. Robert Dole to aid malnourished people.
The HOPE Act, formally known as the Kansas Hope, Opportunity and Prosperity for Everyone Act, was signed into law in April 2015 by then-Gov. Sam Brownback. The measure significantly increased barriers to participation among Kansans in SNAP, previously known as the food stamp program. In the subsequent decade, Republican leadership in the Kansas Legislature has continued to seek expansion of restrictions on SNAP beyond minimum requirements in federal law.
“As a born-and-raised Kansan, living just 30 miles from Bob Dole’s hometown, I knew from a young age that if Bob Dole fought for something, it was the right thing to do.” said Jami Reever, executive director for Kansas Appleseed. “His fight to end hunger became Kansas’ fight to end hunger, and to see that legacy stripped away year after year is contrary to Kansas values.”
On Wednesday, Kansas Appleseed released a report on the 10-year anniversary of the HOPE Act that outlined political history of anti-hunger initiatives tied to Kansas, challenged criticism of SNAP and recommended the state embrace policies to better meet food needs of families.
The report said Kansas ranked 48th among the states and District of Columbia in terms of SNAP access. The state ranked fifth-lowest in terms of the rate of eligible people enrolled in SNAP, Kansas Appleseed said.
“This report highlights the sharp contrast between our state’s regressive approach to SNAP and the compassionate, bipartisan legacy of feeding people that Kansas forefather Bob Dole left our state,” said Haley Kottler of Kansas Appleseed. “Because of these regressive approaches, Kansas has gone from leading the nation on anti-hunger efforts to becoming one of the hardest places to access SNAP. That is not who we are, and it is not who we have to be.”
Kansas Appleseed proposed enhancing access to SNAP to mirror “real needs of everyday, hardworking Kansans.” Research showed participation in SNAP improved dietary intake, supported mental health, reduced poverty and promoted economic self-sufficiency, Kansas Appleseed said.
 HOPE Act?
In 2015, Brownback took on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program borne of bipartisan advocacy by Republican U.S. Sen. Dole of Kansas and the late Democratic U.S. Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota.
Brownback signed the HOPE Act to limit adults without children to three months on SNAP during any 36-month period in which the person wasn’t employed part-time or enrolled in job training. In addition, individuals with a felony drug conviction were given a lifetime ban from SNAP in Kansas.
People without authority to legally live in the United States were excluded from calculations of household size when determining SNAP eligibility, but earnings of those immigrants was counted when assessing whether a household qualified in terms of overall income. The law also forbid use of federal or state funding to inform the public about available food assistance.
Brownback also banned use of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families cash assistance to buy alcohol, cigarettes or lottery, concert or sports event tickets. TANF cash couldn’t be expended in a movie theater, swimming pool, theme park or video arcade.
Brownback said the idea was to implement state laws that could compel people to lift themselves out of poverty.
“The primary focus of the bill is to get people back to work,” Brownback said at the time. “Because that’s where the real benefit is — getting people off public assistance and back into the marketplace with the dignity.”
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who voted against the HOPE Act in 2015 while a member of the Kansas Senate, said state laws undermining the potential of SNAP and TANF were a mistake.
“The HOPE Act was wrong then, and it remains wrong now,” Kelly said. “Now, more than ever, the Legislature should look for ways to support working Kansas families rather than further shredding the safety net that gives Kansans a bridge back to self-sufficiency.”
Research by a University of Kansas professor indicated state policy or law limiting enrollment in SNAP made it more difficult to prevent child abuse or neglect as well as prevent entry of children into foster care. In aftermath of the HOPE Act, the number of Kansas children in foster care reached a record level.
SNAP under attack
Hunger Free America reported U.S. Department of Agriculture data indicated 15.3% of Kansas residents lived in food insecure households between 2021 to 2023. That included 13.6% of children, 8.4% of working adults and 6.6% of elderly residents in Kansas.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, created in 2022 the House Welfare Reform Committee to advance the welfare agenda started by Brownback. In a speech, Hawkins said the state should focus on shrinking government rather than “growing the welfare state and dependency.”
He said tax dollars ought to be reserved for “the truly needy instead of siphoning them away to able-bodied adults who don’t want to work.”
That point of emphasis led to House Bill 2140, which was advanced in 2023 to further limit eligibility for SNAP. Existing law at that time blocked SNAP benefits to able-bodied adults 18 to 49 without dependents and not employed at least 30 hours per week unless they were in a job training program. The bill, which died in the Senate, would have extended the prohibition to Kansans 50 to 59 years of age.
Another piece of legislation in 2023, endorsed by the Florida think tank Opportunity Solutions Project, would cut SNAP benefits to noncustodial parents who fell behind in child support payments. GOP advocates of the concept said the legislation would withhold food aid from families as leverage to extract cash from “deadbeat” parents.
Sen. Oletha Faust Goudeau, a Wichita Democrat, said the bill would have made it less likely parents could support their children and more likely people went hungry.
“Reducing access to food for Kansans who are already struggling financially is unnecessarily harsh and ineffective,” Faust Goudeau said.
In the 2025 session, the House and Senate approved a bill requiring the state to seek permission from USDA to exclude candy and soft drinks from Kansas’ list of products eligible to be bought with SNAP benefits. Kelly vetoed the bill. The Senate voted to override the governor, but the House didn’t challenge the veto.
“Restricting assistance under the guise of making sure low-income individuals are ‘healthy’ strips them of their dignity,” said Sen. Pat Pettey, a Democrat from Kansas City, Kansas. “Families in poverty face enough challenges, but what they chose to eat should not be legislated.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/P2200254-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 10:18:48.965850

Jared Polis delivers his state of the state address in the House chamber of the Colorado Capitol building in Denver Jan. 9, 2025. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post/Pool)About a week after the November election, as dread of a new Trump administration took hold throughout much of the country, the launch of an interstate initiative to protect democracy and the rule of law offered a message of optimism amid an otherwise bleak run of news. The initiative, an alliance called Governors Safeguarding Democracy, would be chaired by Govs. Jared Polis of Colorado and JB Pritzker of Illinois.
“We founded GSD because we know that simple hope alone won’t save our democracy. We need to work together, especially at the state level, to protect and strengthen it,” Polis said at the time.
Five months on, it’s not clear that the alliance has done much of anything to protect democracy or the rule of law. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has rapidly transformed the federal government into a terrorizing instrument of authoritarian rule, wherein democratic principles are ignored and the rule of law is mocked. America by some measures has ceased even to qualify as a democracy, and armed agents of the state now snatch people from neighborhood streets and deliver them to brutal prisons in other countries.
Any optimism inspired by the GSD initiative has proved misplaced, and Polis appears to be unprepared for the historic emergency that faces the country.
But he’s not alone. Other leading Democrats in Colorado similarly seem blind to the acute dangers ahead. They have little to offer Coloradans beyond simple hope.

Newsline recently sent Polis’ office a set of questions about GSD’s activities. Which governors had joined the alliance? What actions has Polis taken as co-chair?
A spokesperson for the governor responded that “this nonpartisan organization continues to bring together think tanks, legal experts, and democracy advocates to inform policy that protects the rule of law and serves the people of our states.” She provided no specifics, and she gave no indication that Polis had taken any single specific action to advance GSD goals.
A spokesperson for GSD provided a little more information when asked similar questions, writing in an email that “GSD provides legal and policy tools and resources and hosts briefings on a range of issues” and that governors’ offices have “issued executive orders to create taskforces on immigration matters, hiring practices, and efforts to recruit federal workers laid off or fired by the federal government.”
Polis has issued no executive orders related to GSD’s work.
The spokesperson also said that much of the work is “behind-the-scenes.” She provided virtually no specifics.
It might be the case that GSD’s work occurs out of view, but if the outcome of that work is also invisible, it’s meaningless, and if its work were at all effective, democracy and the rule of law wouldn’t be vanishing.
Federal authorities have rounded up an untold number of Colorado residents under questionable legal authority and with almost no transparency. At least two of those people are at risk of being disappeared into the CECOT prison in El Salvador. If Polis wants to protect the rule of law, he should say something about their case.
On the contrary, Polis has helped legitimize parts of Trump’s agenda. He cheered the appointment of conspiracist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services and has welcomed major elements of Trump’s mass deportation plan.
Other top Colorado Democrats, such U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, have also failed to offer a persuasive check to MAGA threats.
Bennet stands out for particular reproof. His votes in the Senate, like Hickenlooper’s, have aligned with Trump’s agenda at an alarming rate, but now he wants to ditch D.C. and serve as Colorado’s next governor. In a speech at Denver’s City Park to announce his campaign, Bennet acknowledged that “everything we care about now is at stake in our country,” but the line lands like a focus group-tested talking point when weighed against the balance of Bennet’s pick-your-battles posture toward Trumpist fascism.
In an interview on 9News last week, Bennet bizarrely framed the 2024 election, in which an aspiring autocrat and convicted felon baited the electorate’s id and poisoned the national conversation with prolific lies, as a good faith contest that Democrats deserved to lose. Challenged by host Kyle Clark to specify how support for Trump Cabinet members has helped Colorado, Bennet all but acknowledged it does not.
“I think that’s a fair question,” Bennet said. “And we’ll have to look two years from now to really answer it.”
Does Bennet actually think we have two years to find out?
Other Democrats — though frighteningly few — understand that we don’t, and they have begun to model what real resistance to a fledgling dictatorship looks like.
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, speaking on threats to American democracy, recently delivered the longest floor speech in U.S. Senate history. “These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said.
Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York recently visited cities, including Denver and Greeley, around the country as part of their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour. Their events drew tens of thousands of people who were eager to show up in person as a form of rebuke against anti-democracy forces.
Polis’ GSD partner Pritzker has been frank and outspoken in describing what Trump is doing to the country, comparing Trump’s vision for America to Nazi Germany.
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, is at the vanguard of the legal fight against Trump.
Such instances of resistance might not result in immediate change, but they are welcome alternatives to the shoulder-shrugging and rank complicity practiced by other Democrats, who appear to equate minority status in Washington with helplessness.
Booker is right. These are not normal times. They call for extraordinary action. They call for elected leaders to do everything in their power to protect democracy and the rule of law. Simple hope alone won’t cut it.

The Susitna is threatened by the West Susitna Access Project, according to this year's report released by the conservation group American Rivers. (Photo provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Alaska ShoreZone program)Southcentral Alaska’s Susitna River is one of the nation’s most endangered rivers because of a state plan to build a 100-mile road into its uplands to encourage mining, oil and gas drilling, logging and other development, according to a report released Wednesday.
The Susitna ranked eighth on a list of 10 threatened waterways cited in the annual report issued by the conservation group American Rivers.
The 10 sites in the report, titled America’s Most Endangered Rivers of 2025, were chosen according to their ecological and community importance, the magnitude of the threats from pollution, development or other factors and the opportunities for the public to sway pending policy decisions.
For the Susitna, the threat comes from the West Susitna Access Project, according to the report. The project, being pursued by the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities and the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, proposes a road linking the Parks Highway north of Anchorage to the roadless upstream area of the Skwentna River, a Susitna River tributary that runs along the base of the Tordrillo Mountains.
The road would cross 180 streams, degrading hunting, fishing and wildlife habitat, and the mining, drilling and other resource extraction enabled by the road would contaminate the river’s water and the air above it, the report said. That, in turn, would threaten fishing-related businesses and harvesters, local tourism and communities, including Alaska Native communities dependent on the river’s resources for subsistence food-gathering, the report said.
The report urges the public to join the campaign against the road project by submitting comments during the ongoing environmental review process to oppose any U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit approval. The report also urges the public to campaign against any federal funding of the project.
Organizations that advised American Rivers on the Susitna River’s status included the Susitna River Coalition, Cook Inletkeeper and the Chickaloon Village Traditional Council, a Tribal government.
“The West Susitna Industrial Access Road will bring sweeping changes to our region—transforming fish and wildlife habitat, altering subsistence resources, decimating sustainable economies, and reshaping the outdoor experiences that Alaskans and visitors from around the world cherish,” Margaret Stern, program and communications director for the Susitna River Coalition, said in a statement released by American Rivers. “This boondoggle project would open the door to large-scale industrial development in one of the world’s last truly wild places. We must ensure that local communities, hunters, anglers, and all advocates for wild spaces make their voices heard in ensuring the future of this unique region.”
Officials from the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities and AIDEA did not immediately respond to questions about the American Rivers report.
The West Susitna Access Project stretches back more than a decade.

	Supporters say it would unlock economic opportunities for the state. That argument is made in a short video posted on AIDEA’s website.
“Millions of acres of state lands lie west of the Susitna River, providing new opportunities to Alaskans for outdoor recreation, jobs and economic growth. These lands hold critical minerals and other stranded resources that are vital for Alaska’s economic future,” the video’s narrator says.
The project was originally proposed in 2013 as part of then-Gov. Sean Parnell’s Roads to Resources program, which envisioned numerous new roads that would enable resource extraction in remote areas of the state.
In 2023, the project was split in two, with the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities in charge of the envisioned first 22 miles and AIDEA leading development plans for the remaining miles.
The state transportation department, which would use a combination of state and federal funding for the project, has launched an environmental review process needed to obtain a wetlands-development permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
However, Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s request for $2.5 million to help move the project along was omitted from the state capital budget that the Alaska Senate passed unanimously on Tuesday.
Other Alaska rivers have made the annual list in past years, including the Kobuk River, which was in the 2024 report because of the proposed Ambler Access Project, which proposes an industrial road of about 200 miles into the Brooks Range foothills.
Other U.S. rivers listed in this year’s report as being among the 10 most endangered are in different parts of the Lower 48 states.
The Mississippi River, which passes through several states, topped the endangered list. American Rivers based that status on increased flooding and what it categorized as inadequate flood prevention and response.

(Photo: Jeff Anderson/ USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service)Imagine you want to create and control a large pool of capital predominantly financed by grants and other people’s money. Simply define a geographic boundary, let’s call it a ‘district,’ and get a few business colleagues to decide what mandatory fee or compulsory assessment you’re going to collect to benefit your private business agendas. Next, petition a state senator and county commissioner; most are eager to curry favor with deep-pocketed business donors. Create a nonprofit to which you will funnel the dollars. Small business owners will be required to collect the fee at the point of sale in your district. You hold the cards because you’ve engineered the framework and set the fee percentage. Sounds a bit Sopranos-like, doesn’t it?
Schemes like this – blandly called Business Improvement Districts or BIDs – are undemocratic but legal ways to levy fees (effectively a sales tax when businesses pass the cost of the fees on to consumers) that benefit the few over the many. BIDs first appeared in the 1970s, but have become a controversial power grab for business interests and developers in recent years to finance tourism destination dreams and pet projects outside of public control or view. BIDs represent a particular risk for unincorporated areas because there are no elected mayors or city councils to hold public meetings or be answerable. 
All citizens and small business owners should be concerned. A few influential businesses or developers can band together and force new recurring costs on an entire community – tacked on at the point of sale. Worse still, the International Journal of Public Administration noted: “BIDs have arisen as a new form of ‘private government.’ As they expand their menus of services, often including land-use planning, and approaching more general-purpose government status, BIDs have begun to raise issues of accountability.”
Private governments with little transparency
Where might you begin such a monetary diversion maneuver in Nevada?  Follow the play book of Nevada Democratic state Sen. Skip Daly, who, at the behest of unelected people – such as Julie Regan, executive director of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), tourism executive Andy Chapman, now Chair of the Tahoe Transportation District, and TRPA government affairs manager Devin Middlebrook along with legal consulting firm Civitas Advisers – successfully advanced a BID proposal to a panel of his fellow legislators during an interim meeting last year. Put forward by TRPA (a bi-state agency with lots of political sway), their business cronies who will determine BID details — such as where to draw geographic boundaries, how much to levy and where to spend funds — also promoted the bill.
If this is the first time you’ve heard about this fast-moving state legislation, Senate bill 420, that’s by design. Tax-like enabling legislation that will negatively impact constituent wallets is best kept under wraps. 
How is SB420 novel?
SB420 needs state-level approval because there’s no existing legal path to create a BID in unincorporated portions of a Nevada county. Existing Nevada law (like NRS 271A for Tourism Improvement Districts) focuses on cities and municipal projects. As called out in the Lake Tahoe Destination Stewardship plan (p. 38), “legislation would need to be pursued” as “there is currently no statute enabling this sort of improvement district in Nevada,” Hence, testimony from Chapman, President and CEO of Travel North Tahoe Nevada, on April 4: “Senate Bill 420 will create the ability for local businesses within the Nevada portion of the Tahoe Basin to petition the relevant county to create a Business Improvement District (known as a BID), which could only be created with the support of the business community AND approval by the County Commission.”
The goal for this improvement district mechanism is to create a long-term funding solution for issues in Nevada’s Lake Tahoe area. This type of improvement district legislation exists already in California.  As written SB420’s BID model is funded through the levy of assessments on business. However, it’s not clear what businesses this bill will encompass or exempt. Section 6.1 defines “business” as all types of businesses, including, without limitations financial institutions and professions.” That means if a business license address lies inside the proposed boundary, that business license holder could be assessed. SB420 includes a broad scope of what activities can be undertaken, but residents don’t have a voice. 
If signed into law, SB420 could create a template in Nevada for future quasi-governmental taxation in counties, virtually unregulated by the legislature or department of taxation. 
If other broadly written BIDs elsewhere are any indication, more surprises lie ahead. Residents of Rochester, New York, characterized a proposed BID there “as a shadow government.”  While told that businesses would pay for the BID, reporters learned, as residents suspected, it would be mostly taxpayers who would fund the BID managed by 17 “movers and shakers in business and political circles” — members of a nonprofit established to control the Rochester BID. 
BIDs are hard to undo. When formed BIDs become legal special districts, in Nevada’s case, under state law. Dissolving a BID, governed by a management plan written by consultants like Civitas who obtain multi-year contracts, usually requires approval from the same body that created it. Who likes to relinquish money and power? Businesses – particularly tourism outfits with multiple locations or headquartered elsewhere – can get away with charging added fees because of high-turnover visitors. BID members can even use money generated by the fees to market themselves.  Self-dealing at its worst. 
Residents who shop, dine or recreate within a ‘district’ always pay the fee. Communities effectively subsidize private agendas. Residents in San Diego revealed how Civitas’ founder has a history of creating legal loopholes (p. 14). Civitas Advisors as of March 2013 had pocketed $546,016 and counting from San Diego alone; lawsuits followed.
The Sacramento-based firm has expanded overseas but now wants to make Nevada its newest client.
‘I think it’s taxation’
SB420 took shape August 16 at the interim Legislative Committee for the Review and Oversight of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water System. None of Northern Nevadans’ public concerns about public safety and the environment are mentioned or considered in the recommendations for legislation. Instead Daly, at the sixth and final meeting along with other legislators, agreed to advance TRPA’s wish list, including the BID legislation. In the meeting (1:51:24 on the recording), Civitas – the legal firm that stands to profit handsomely to administer BIDs – testified, not surprisingly, in support of it. 
Senator Robin Titus (minutes, p.16), however, saw the scheme for what it is: “I am going to be a ‘no’ on this when it comes to a vote. I truly cannot accept—I think [it’s] a taxation.”
Assemblymember Ken Gray shared the concerns: “I want to echo Senator Titus’ comments as well.”
Citizens (not business owners) who participated in the April 4 Senate working session opposed the BID legislation and its lack of specificity. BID activities in SB420 include promotion of events, marketing and economic development, transportation and other services that confer “benefit upon assessed businesses in the district.”  
If this isn’t a tax why does the state legislature need to have a bill that involves the Department of Taxation to facilitate what businesses should be managing or funding on their own. Is SB420 really in the best interests of Nevada residents? This should be a red flag for other state legislatures who’ve been lobbied to create similar legislation.
Transportation alone is a heavy lift. Even the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration agrees. Among BID disadvantages it lists:

“BIDs are not public agencies and cannot be directed to accomplish transportation goals, services or facilities desired by elected officials and agencies. 
“BIDs, as private entities, will not fund public goods or services that provide benefits outside the BID boundaries. Also due to sunset provisions, they are not typically structured to facilitate the development of large infrastructure facilities that require financing.”

Many residents first read the SB420 language amendments only after the bill was advanced out of committee as one of 48 bills reviewed by the Senate Government Affairs Committee April 11. No matter; public comment was reserved for the end of the meeting after voting had ended.
Two senators, Lisa Rogich and Lisa Krasner, went on record to say they reserved the right to change their vote later. Rogich went further, “I’m hoping the parties can continue to have conversations with the community and get the residents on board.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image-5-9-24-at-7.37-PM-1024x622.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 10:18:48.965850

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.


DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.
Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser told a crowd gathered in a Denver high school auditorium Wednesday night that opponents of President Donald Trump’s administration are fighting “to keep America, America.”
Weiser welcomed three of his counterparts from other states — Attorneys General Nick Brown of Washington, Anne Lopez of Hawaii and Aaron Ford of Nevada — for the latest in a series of “community impact hearings” on Trump’s agenda at George Washington High School.
The four are among the 23 elected Democratic attorneys general nationwide who have led the fight against the second Trump administration’s agenda in the courts. Weiser has sued Trump at least a dozen times so far, including challenges to the administration’s attempt to end the 14th Amendment’s protections for birthright citizenship; its sweeping freeze of many federal grant and aid programs; its mass layoffs of federal employees; and its defunding of medical research through the National Institutes of Health.

Weiser said the legal challenges have borne some fruit in the form of preliminary injunctions and other procedural victories, but acknowledged growing alarm over whether “this democratic republic (will) hold.”
“These court victories are important, but more important is everyone’s voice,” Weiser said, encouraging the crowd to join protests like the one that drew 8,000 people to the Colorado Capitol on April 5. “We need to use our voice.”
Here are the legal actions Colorado has taken against Trump administration

Wednesday’s event came amid an outcry this week over the fates of more than 200 immigrants deported by the Trump administration to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador, and promises by Trump to send American citizens there next. At least one of the deportees, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members of many others say that they were falsely identified as members of a transnational gang because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team.
The administration has also moved to target hundreds of lawful permanent residents and student visa holders for deportation, including Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student who led pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations at Columbia University, and Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University doctoral student who was detained after writing an op-ed in her student newspaper. Lawyers for Jeanette Vizguerra, a Colorado woman without legal status who was detained by federal authorities last month, have also alleged in court that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement retaliated against Vizguerra for her immigration advocacy work.
“We won’t tolerate people being picked up without any process and shipped to some other country with no recourse,” Weiser told the crowd to applause. “The First Amendment matters, because when you speak, and you speak your truth, you cannot be — in this country — retaliated against for speaking your truth.”
Weiser, serving his second term as attorney general after winning reelection in 2022, is running for Colorado governor in 2026. He faces a tough primary contest against U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, who entered the race last week.
Constitutional crisis?
Weiser and his fellow attorneys general heard stories from Coloradans personally impacted by the Trump administration’s actions, including federal workers, homelessness service providers and refugee support organizations.
Marya Washburn, a U.S. Forest Service employee, was part of a firefighting team that responded to the Alexander Mountain Fire in Colorado last summer. In February, she was among the 3,400 probationary employees at the agency to receive termination notices from the Trump administration, and although she was reinstated thanks to a court order, that order is set to end on Saturday.
“I’m shaking,” Washburn said as she read from her notes, citing concerns about cuts to firefighting personnel ahead of the 2025 fire season. “I’m angry.”
Trump’s mass layoffs, funding freezes and attempted shutdowns of congressionally-established agencies amount to an unprecedented expansion of executive power that runs contrary to longstanding separation-of-powers principles in the U.S. Constitution. Fears that his administration will defy adverse court rulings have also reached new heights in recent days, especially following its apparent inaction in the face of a 9-0 Supreme Court ruling last week stating the administration must “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.
Brown, elected as Washington attorney general last year, said that the outcomes of some legal challenges to the administration — like the restoration of grant funding that Trump had attempted to freeze — had “for the most part” given him “confidence in our system.” But that confidence is now being tested.
“This is the first time — this week, in the days past — where I think we’re really getting to the precipice of a constitutional crisis,” he said. “And I don’t say that lightly.”
“I don’t have all the answers. I do not know what it means for a president to blatantly disregard what a court says. I don’t think we’re quite there yet,” Brown continued. “But we might be there tomorrow, or next week.”

Stephanie Young (D-Detroit) joined Mothering Justice for an event in Lansing to mark Black Maternal Health Week on Wednesday.
She said events like the advocacy day organized by Mothering Justice are important to the legislative process.
“Legislation usually starts, unfortunately, when something may have gone wrong or something is under attack,” Young said. “And we’re in a space now where so many things are under attack.”
A “momnibus” bill package that seeks to reduce racial inequities in maternal mortality is currently working its way through the Michigan Senate. While policies in the package had bipartisan support last legislative session, state Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) noted last month when the package was reintroduced that the bills became a “lame duck casualty of the House” after Republican lawmakers boycotted session in December in protest to minimum and tipped wage reforms not being placed for a vote.



Black Maternal Health Statistics
In 2023, the maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black women was 50.3 deaths per 100,000 live births, nearly 3.5 times the rate for non-Hispanic White women. (CDC, 2025). 
In the U.S., Black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than White women. CDC notes that more than 80% of pregnancy related deaths are preventable (CDC, 2024)
In 2022, the rate of preterm birth among Black women (12.34%) was about 1.5 times higher than the rate of preterm birth among white or Hispanic women, 7.64% and 8.72% respectively. (CDC, 2024)
Statistics provided by Black Mamas Matter Alliance.



Young said at Wednesday’s event that “just to talk about Black mamas is under attack now.”
“We were okay with lifting it up before, but now it is like a dog whistle for people,” Young said.
She said the heightened reactivity has led her to tailor her message to each audience individually.
“I can get what I need to get for Black mamas without saying ‘Black mama’ sometimes, but I can be in some spaces where that’s all I’m going to say. But I just know who I’m dealing with,” Young said. “So we’re learning how to be strategic.”

But Young added that Black women face increased challenges in the health care system than their white counterparts, including in being believed when they say something is wrong or that they need medication.
“If a house is on fire on the block with 20 houses, do you stop at the other 19, or do you focus on the one that’s in the most jeopardy, the one that’s about to go up in flames?” Young said. “When we talk about Black maternal health, it’s because we’ve been the ones that’s been in the most jeopardy of not getting the services that we needed.”

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Two teachers unions, parents, advocates sue over Trump dismantling of Department of Education

Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

 DEI-related cuts

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Trump signs order directing Education secretary to shut down her own department

Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.

If you’ve experienced any trouble or hiccups receiving your Social Security recently, California Attorney General Rob Bonta unveiled a new complaint page on Tuesday for residents to report disruptions they faced when accessing their benefits.
Social Security is funded by payroll taxes from today’s workers, which provide financial assistance to retired and disabled workers. Roughly 6 million Californians receive the benefit and more than 65 million Americans do in total. “Social Security is an essential program that provides critical support to millions…” a 2023 brief from Stanford University found.
As part of President Donald Trump’s push to slash federal spending, the Social Security Administration said in February that it would cut 7,000 jobs — or roughly 12% of its overall workforce. It also said it would reorganize its 10 regional offices down to four.
Though most of Bonta’s complaint form is applicable to those already receiving benefits, many of the reported confusion surrounding the agency’s changes relate to newly eligible people trying to sign up for benefits.
Agency offices, for example, are no longer accepting walk-in appointments. There have also been many reports of people facing longer wait times for appointments and to receive their first benefits and Medicare coverage. In Southern California, elderly people who rode the bus for hours to get to Social Security offices were reportedly turned away, according to The New York Times. People who call the Social Security Administration have waited hours on hold for someone to answer. Those who’ve tried to access their accounts online this week were taken to a dead-end page that says “Bad request.” 
To rein in “widespread fraud” — a claim repeatedly made by the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency, and characterized by fact-checkers as exaggerated and misleading — the agency also planned to require in-person proof of eligibility. This meant that starting April 14, people would have no longer been able to file for benefits over the phone. But after receiving backlash from advocates and members of Congress, the agency walked back these restrictions.
On Wednesday Bonta also joined 20 other attorneys general in support of the American Association of People with Disabilities’ lawsuit challenging the Social Security Administration’s staffing cuts and policy changes. 

Bonta, in a statement: “Through their erratic and illegal actions, the Trump Administration and DOGE have weakened both the Social Security Administration’s ability to serve people and the public’s trust in essential government services. This has made it harder — at times impossible — for older adults and persons with disabilities to access the lifesaving benefits and services they depend on.”

CA sues over tariffs

Speaking of Trump and Bonta, the attorney general joined with Gov. Gavin Newsom Wednesday to say they are suing Trump and other federal officials over the administration’s tariffs initially imposed earlier this month, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
In April the president invoked “emergency economic powers” to levy a 10% tariff on all countries importing goods to the U.S., as well as higher reciprocal tariffs on some other nations. But within hours after taking effect, Trump paused most of the reciprocal tariffs, while also increasing China’s import tax.
The fallout resulted in a $6.6 trillion wipeout in the stock market in the first few days, and poses a major risk for California’s public pensions and state budget — which is partially dependent on the income tax generated from stocks. China is also California’s largest trading partner.

Newsom, in a statement: “President Trump’s unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on California families, businesses, and our economy — driving up prices and threatening jobs. We’re standing up for American families who can’t afford to let the chaos continue.”

The lawsuit argues that without specific authorization from Congress, Trump’s actions are “unlawful,” and calls for a judge to immediately pause the tariffs.

Let’s dive into some higher education news:

Injunction against Sonoma State University: Facing a $24 million budget gap and steep declines in enrollment, Sonoma State in January said it planned to terminate more than a dozen majors for the 2025-26 academic year and eliminate the university’s intercollegiate sports teams. But on Tuesday a county judge temporarily blocked California State University leaders from cutting Sonoma State’s academic programs after student athletes sued, arguing that the university didn’t follow system procedures. A new hearing is scheduled for May 1. Read more from CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.


Inequities in dual enrollment courses: High school students wanting to get a headstart on their college education can take dual enrollment courses, which allow them to attend a community college, typically for free. Students in these programs are more likely to go on to a community college or university compared to their peers who aren’t. But California rural students, male students and students of color don’t enroll in and complete dual enrollment courses at the same rate as others — potentially leading them to miss out on opportunities that better prepare them for college.

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)The U.S. Interior this week announced the transfer of close to 110,000 acres along New Mexico’s southern border to the U.S. Army. According to a news release, the transfer is intended to “safeguard sensitive natural and cultural resources in the region while enabling the Department of the Army to support U.S. Border Patrol operations in securing the border and preventing illegal immigration.”
The transfer follows a memorandum President Donald Trump signed last week directing several agencies to start militarizing a stretch of the southern border, an escalation of the administration’s use of the U.S. military amid its immigration crackdown.
“Securing our border and protecting our nation’s resources go hand in hand,” Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. “The American people gave President Trump a mandate to make America safe and strong again. This transfer reflects Interior’s commitment to public safety, national security and responsible stewardship of our public lands.”
According to the Interior, the transfer came at the Army’s request “to allow for the increase in regular patrols by federal personnel, construction of infrastructure to prevent unlawful entry, disrupt foreign terrorist threats to the U.S., and to curb illegal cross-border activities, such as unlawful migration, narcotics trafficking, migrant smuggling, and human trafficking.”
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) whose congressional district includes the state’s border towns, earlier this week condemned Trump’s move to militarize the border “misguided and wasteful.” In a statement provided to Source, Vasquez said: “Deploying military assets to the border, during a record time of low crossing numbers, is a misguided and wasteful use of military resources and taxpayer dollars. As a lifelong border resident who has spent years working with border stakeholders, I can tell you that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work—and in some places, including parts of New Mexico’s Bootheel, this kind of made-for-TV stunt does little to nothing to solve our nation’s broken immigration system.”
The Interior news release notes that the “crisis along the border” also includes an “environmental crisis,” noting that the area along the border hosts 23 federally endangered species as well as cultural sites “that range from small artifact scatters to large multi-room pueblos. Transfer of the management of this land to the Army will facilitate military engagement to prevent unauthorized human activity in ecologically sensitive areas along the southern border, which can be harmed by repeated foot traffic, unregulated vehicle use, and the creation of informal trails or camps.” In addition, “high-traffic illegal crossings can lead to soil erosion, damage to fragile desert vegetation and critical wildlife habitat, loss and damage to cultural resources, increased fire risk and pollution from trash and human waste.”
Two service members deployed to the border were killed earlier this week, and one was injured, in a vehicle accident near Santa Teresa.
In a statement following the accident, Vasquez said he was “deeply saddened by the tragic loss of two service members today near Santa Teresa. My thoughts are with their families, loved ones, and fellow service members during this difficult time. With the recent deployments to and the new mission at the Southern border, we must fully review the circumstances surrounding this incident. We owe it to them—and all who serve—to ensure their safety is never compromised.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/borderfence-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 09:05:48.512772

After decades, the airport will soon connect to LA Metro. Probably.","Ten million people live in Los Angeles County, and the region’s Metro rail system carried 300 million riders last year. Los Angeles International Airport is one of the world’s busiest and most important, with more than 76 million passengers in 2024. But try taking a train to or from any place in that county to that airport. They don’t link up and never have — though, that may at last be about to change.
Why there is no train to the airport is anybody’s guess. 
Did the taxi industry maneuver to block it many years ago? Did nearby neighborhoods quietly object? Did land-use planners simply not think of it? Everyone has a theory, but the failure to bring a train to the airport is one of those municipal mishaps whose rationale is lost to time.
Even the region’s most deeply rooted leaders are at a loss to explain it. 
Take Janice Hahn, for one. Not many people have a richer political history in Los Angeles than Hahn, who is both a county supervisor and the chair of LA Metro, the regional rail authority. Hahn served on the Los Angeles City Council and in Congress before being elected to the county board. Her father was a council member and legendary supervisor. Her brother was the mayor. Even she doesn’t know how LA’s train system managed to bypass an international airport.
Former County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, another of the region’s political veterans, acknowledged that the decision to route the Green Line just beyond the periphery of the airport “made no sense at all.” In his memoir, Yaroslavsky calls the project “the Moses Line” because a traveler can see the Promised Land from it but can’t quite enter it.
Kenneth Hahn, Janice Hahn’s father, helped spearhead the region’s first light rail. He imagined it someday reaching the airport. That was in 1980.
Forty-five years, tens of millions of dollars and countless neighborhood and government meetings since, the rail network has expanded, sweeping across Los Angeles County. But not to LAX.
It’s not like there’s no demand for such a connection. Traffic at the airport has been a dreaded fact of Los Angeles life for longer than most people here have lived. The horseshoe that connects the terminals backs up at all hours of the day, and trips to and from the airport grind to a standstill as soon as your car enters the loop.
Years ago, Hahn was dedicating a project at the airport, and she jokingly reflected on President Reagan’s famous observation that “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’”
The equivalent in Los Angeles, Hahn said, were, “Hey, can you give me a ride to LAX?”
Local officials have devised a host of stop-gap solutions over the years. Passengers can link up to fly-away shuttles that connect the airport to downtown and the San Fernando Valley. The airport has a special lot for rideshares, and buses connect LAX to different parts of town.
But for any passenger used to traveling the world — anyone who has walked from the terminal to the Metro stop at Reagan National in Washington or experienced the ease of transit access in airports from San Francisco to Paris to Hong Kong — LAX is an outlier.
Why not just extend the train? The obstacles range from cost to local opposition. LAX has strained to expand its traffic while keeping the neighborhood around it pacified. Noise restrictions, quieter jets, traffic controls have all helped, but the managers of the airport have waged a protracted campaign to keep some people happy — even at the expense of the larger region’s convenience.
For years, officials were paralyzed by the fear of litigation, afraid of even uttering the words “airport expansion.” They would talk instead of “airport modernization.” Running a light rail through the area generated reflexive opposition.
And so, airline passengers step off flights, collect their bags and schlep across the airport to the rideshare lot. Or hop on a bus to take them to a train, as they have for generations.
That may be about to change. Soon. Probably.
Two major projects are underway that together should end the mysterious gap in the transportation network of America’s second-largest city. LAX is constructing a so-called People Mover intended to whisk travelers around the airport, and Metro is extending the K Line to connect with a newly built LAX/Metro Transit Center just outside the airport. 
Together, they are designed to finally close the gap in the region’s transit network, so that a person could board a train in, say, Hollywood or the Valley or Pasadena and ride it to the new LAX transit center and board a people mover to take them to their terminal. 
This would happen all without transferring to a bus or hailing a cab or hitting up a friend for a ride.
It’s tempting — but slightly premature — to declare this long struggle over. The twin project was scheduled to open in December, but Angelenos know it hasn’t. The construction in and around the airport continues. Now the target date is December 2025, and Hahn is optimistic about hitting that one.
Even with the delay, it would plug the hole in the transportation donut well in time for its international coming-out party, the 2028 Olympic Games. “This is a big one if you really want to showcase the city,” Hahn said.
International travelers expect to be able to move about a city on public transit, and that starts when they land. The train service to the airport, she added, will “put Los Angeles International Airport into the international airport club.”
And so construction continues, winding closer and closer to the day that has eluded generations of transit leaders in this city. It’s fallen short so often and for so long that it will be hard to believe until it actually opens. But Hahn is allowing herself a flicker of optimism.
“I do think,” she said last week, “this long nightmare is going to come to an end.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/121922_LAX_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-17 09:05:48.512772

California was allowed to include students without legal status, which the Trump administration is now ending.","In summary
Federal programs offer financial aid and counseling to low-income and first-generation college students. California was allowed to include students without legal status, which the Trump administration is now ending. 


President Donald Trump has taken aim at students and professors at California’s elite institutions, such as UC Berkeley and UCLA, but community colleges, which enroll the majority of the state’s students, have largely avoided the administration’s ire.
Until recently. The U.S. Department of Education announced on March 27 that it was stopping California universities and colleges from using federal funding to “provide services to illegal immigrants.” The education department is specifically referring to federal TRIO programs, which provide various forms of financial aid and counseling to low-income, first-generation students. 
California schools don’t track how many of their students lack legal status. Although exact figures are hard to capture, some estimates, such as the number of applications for in-state aid, suggest that there are thousands of students without legal status, most of whom are attending California’s community colleges.  
More than 100,000 students in California are enrolled in a TRIO program, said Dalia Hernandez, the president of a professional association that works closely with these programs. Informally, colleges know that some students in these programs lack legal status. Now campus TRIO officials are grappling with the president’s order and wondering if they are going to have to start documenting citizenship.  
Although non-citizens aren’t eligible for federal financial aid, in 2022 the education department granted California special permission to enroll them in TRIO programs’ academic services through September 2026.  
Now the administration is revoking that permission. 
In a Zoom webinar a few days after the education department’s announcement, Hernandez’s organization, the Western Association of Educational Opportunity Personnel, told college leaders that they could keep serving students in their programs, regardless of immigration status. However, moving forward, schools would need to reject any suspected non-citizen, she said. The federal education department has yet to provide any additional guidance about how to interpret the TRIO policy change. 
“I’ve been in 1,000 meetings talking about every executive order that comes out, and every meeting is like, ‘Well, we don’t know what’s going to happen and it’s probably going to get blocked by a federal judge, so just hold on,’” said Brian Boomer, the director of grants at the West Hills Community College District in California’s Central Valley. “This was a little different because they actually gave a directive.”
Outside of California, it’s easy to see why some might argue these federal dollars should only serve U.S. citizens, Boomer said. But in Fresno and Kings counties, where his community college district is located, he said many immigrants are embedded in the community, work in nearby farms, and send their children to the region’s schools and colleges. “That’s the population you serve,” he said. “Our area feeds the country.”
Coalinga College is one of the two schools in his district. More than 70% of its students identify as Latino, and many are current or former farmworkers or children of farmworkers. The college’s largest TRIO program, called Student Support Services, has just under 200 low-income, first generation students enrolled, said Lissette Padilla, who oversees it. 
Some of those students likely don’t have legal status, she said, but it’s not clear how many. 
A ‘heartbreaking’ change for one student
As a low-income student with a learning disability and the first in his family to attend college, “J” knew he needed help navigating Oxnard College, a community college in Ventura County. He applied to one of the TRIO programs in 2021 but he said he was rejected because program administrators suspected he wasn’t a U.S. citizen. CalMatters has agreed to withhold his name because he fears drawing attention to his legal status. 
“I thought this was going to be for all first-generation students,” he said. “I felt like I was abandoned.”  
Two years later, after the state got special permission from the federal government, the director of the program reached out to J again, this time to encourage him to reapply. As part of one of the TRIO programs, J got one-on-one guidance with campus counselors who helped ensure that he was on track to meet his academic goals and transfer to a four-year university. The TRIO staff also took him on trips to visit various colleges, including Cal State Northridge, Chico State, and Cal State Long Beach. 
Last summer, he enrolled at Cal State Channel Islands, ready to pursue a bachelor’s degree. Many Cal State and University of California campuses offer TRIO programs to their students, but Channel Islands isn’t one of them. “It’s very disappointing,” he said because he was hoping to stay enrolled in one of the TRIO programs.
Even if the university began offering TRIO programs, he won’t qualify if colleges enforce the Trump administration’s policy change. J said it’s “heartbreaking” that students without legal status will no longer have that opportunity to enroll. 
In the first few days after the Trump administration’s announcement, schools received little guidance about how to respond and looked to Hernandez, the regional association president, for guidance. She said her interpretation is that TRIO programs are only required to evaluate a student’s eligibility when they first enroll. As a result, she said schools do not need to kick out any students who are currently enrolled, but they shouldn’t register any new students who may lack legal status. 
She also recommended that schools revise their intake forms so that students can only identify as male or female. “We’re protecting the programs and the funding that we have,” said Hernandez, referring to Trump’s executive order on gender identity, which prohibits the U.S. government from recognizing gender expansive terms such as non-binary. 
Padilla said she’s concerned that Coalinga College may, at some point, need to pull counseling services away from students without legal status who are in the program. She said the contingency plan is to move those students into similar programs that are funded by the state and which don’t ask for proof of citizenship. 
Lizette Navarette, the president of Woodland Community College near Sacramento, said she was wary of the initial decision to allow students without legal status to receive services through a federal program. “There was some concern about how safe the student data would be because it’s a federal grant,” she said. For over a year now, her college has been directing those students to state programs, which she said often have more capacity and which don’t share data with the federal government. 
Will TRIO get cut?
In 2021, the national association for TRIO administrators, the Cal State University system, the UC system, the California Department of Education and more than 80 other organizations signed a letter addressed to the U.S. Department of Education, calling on it to allow students without legal status to enroll in TRIO programs. 
But over the years, support has waned. 
The federal government allowed California to expand access to TRIO programs as part of a pilot, which was slated to end next year. In 2023 and 2024, when the U.S. Department of Education discussed expanding access in other states and in a more permanent way, California’s institutions once again voiced their support. But the national association was silent, said Antoinette Flores, the director of a higher education research team at the think tank New America. 
She said the association, known as the Council for Opportunity in Education, fears that allowing students without legal status to participate could elicit more scrutiny from the Trump administration and put the entire program at risk. The association didn’t respond to CalMatters’ request for comment. 
“We have had, over the years, very strong bipartisan support for federal TRIO programs,” said Hernandez, who also serves as the regional representative of the national association. But she acknowledged that nothing is certain. “There is rhetoric from the current administration about dismantling these federal programs.”
She said her regional association still wants to include all low-income, first-generation students in TRIO programs, including students without legal status, but other colleges and universities outside the state may have a different perspective. “California is one of the very few states in the country that has resources and support earmarked for undocumented students and youth. Others may not have as much.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101023-West-Hills-College-LV_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-17 09:05:48.512772

(Photo courtesy of New Energy Equities)Minnesota’s electric grid is cleaner than ever, and the state is well positioned to take advantage of emerging energy industries, Clean Energy Economy Minnesota said Thursday.
But federal policy chaos — driven by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and general preference for fossil fuels — as well as shifting consumer behavior and lagging implementation of environmentally friendly technologies hint at bigger challenges ahead for one of the fastest-growing sectors of the state’s economy, analysts and industry representatives said at a Monday press briefing.
“Certainly there’s a lot going on right now…that makes predicting the future and [even] predicting today a little bit unsteady,” said Becky Wacker, director of energy services sales in North America for Trane Technologies.
The U.S. power sector saw a “dramatic transformation” in recent years thanks to falling costs for wind and solar power, state clean energy policies and long-term clean power purchase commitments by tech giants like Amazon and Google, said Derrick Flakoll, Bloomberg NEF senior policy associate. In Minnesota, carbon emissions from power generation fell 52% between 2005 and 2024 as cheaper, lower-emitting sources edged coal off the grid, according to CEEM’s 2025 energy factsheet.
More recently, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 spurred investment in nascent clean-tech industries like low-emissions hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, which airlines and jet manufacturers see as key to their long-term sustainability goals. CEEM’s factsheet touted the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit, which pays $1.50 per gallon of sustainable aviation fuel produced and sold in Minnesota through June 2030, and a biofuels startup’s plan to build a $5 billion sustainable aviation fuel plant in Moorhead that could eventually produce nearly 200 million gallons of fuel each year.
These investments “now face significant market risk” due to the Trump administration’s hefty — and self-contradictory — import tariffs, and the very real possibility that Congress narrows or repeals key IRA tax credits later this year.
“The fate of this is hanging in the balance (due to) a lot of political and economic factors,” Flakoll said.
State-level policy looks steadier in the near term, Wacker said. That could be a silver lining for HVAC and refrigeration businesses like Trane, which has rebranded itself as a leader in building efficiency and decarbonization. 
“A number of states are staying pretty consistent in how they’re approaching things,” she said.
Minnesota is 10th in the nation for “overall energy efficiency,” according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. A 2021 law that boosted utility-led efficiency programs saved residents and businesses more than $307 million over two years, CEEM said.
But Minnesota’s ambitious efficiency and sustainability policies haven’t translated into action to the extent seen in nation-leading states and cities, Wacker said. She nodded to Washington state, which will begin holding larger buildings to strict sustainability standards next year; and New York City, where Local Law 97 encourages landlords to swap out creaky boilers for efficient heat pumps.
On electric vehicle uptake, Minnesota lags the national trendline. New registrations fell 44% from 2023 to 2024, slipping below 10,000, as EV sales grew 6.5% nationally, CEEM found. Minnesota had 65,679 plug-in EVs on its roads in November 2024, according to CEEM — less than 2% of total light-duty vehicle registrations. Plug-in vehicles accounted for 1 in 4 vehicle registrations last year in California, the top U.S. EV market, though the total share of EV registrations there remains far lower.
And while it’s not yet clear whether it’s a blip or part of a longer-term trend, Minnesota’s wind power industry stalled out last year.
“That’s a little different from past years, when we had a combination of wind and solar [added to the grid],” said Cathy Liebowitz, director of member engagement for CEEM. 
Flakoll said wind power has several factors working against it right now. Most of the windiest areas already have working turbines; solar farm construction costs are rapidly declining; and the massive scale of the typical wind project can complicate projects, he said.
State lawmakers passed a major energy permitting reform bill last year that could accelerate approvals for large-scale wind and solar installations, but the law won’t take effect until July.
Despite the wind slowdown, CEEM’s latest factsheet had some qualified good news for Minnesota utility customers. The average consumer paid 12.36 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2024, up 1.2% from 2023 and 30% from 2015, CEEM said. But that’s lower than the 2024 national average of 12.99 cents per kilowatt-hour — up 2.4% from 2023.
Minnesotans should blame the aging electric grid and volatile natural gas prices for steadily rising electricity rates, rather than wind and solar farms, Liebowitz and Flakoll said.
Transmission and distribution grid infrastructure account for 63% of the $45 billion Xcel Energy plans to invest through 2029, compared with 11% for renewable power, the utility said in November. 
“The grid is old in general, so updating it regardless of whether it’s clean or not is something states are working on,” Liebowitz said.
Meanwhile, the actual cost of generating power is closely correlated with natural gas prices because gas-fired power plants tend to be the “last” units called on to meet demand, Flakoll said.
“If you rely on natural gas at the margin, you are going to affect bills,” he said. “To say renewables are the driving force behind these electricity rate increases would be overly simplistic and probably not true.”

(Photo by Getty Images)WARNING: This column may be hazardous to the comfort level of many readers. It’s easy to get lost in the bureaucratic weeds of the many agencies at the center of the world of Career and Technical Education (CTE), as I have in my research. Still, please give the column a try. We must struggle to understand the serious growing pains that threaten CTE’s success. 
The Career and Technical Education (CTE) provisions in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future are, arguably, the most important but most neglected part of the landmark legislation. They are intended to provide optional pathways for students to be well-prepared for well-paying jobs as well as for college.
The focus is on Apprenticeships and Career Counseling. And expanding them should be a slam dunk. No one’s against CTE, not even Trump. Students want good jobs and employers want skilled workers, and the Blueprint goes all out to connect them.
Unfortunately, implementation of Apprenticeships and Career Counseling is moving more slowly than it should. And regrettably, the General Assembly did little about it, with two exceptions noted later.
The CTE program can’t succeed without two major improvements. One is to simplify and strengthen lines of authority and accountability among the incredible number of bureaucracies that populate the CTE universe. The second is lack of resources.
Understand first that the CTE goals are extremely ambitious:
Apprenticeships. By school year 2030-31, 45% of public graduates should complete the high school portion of a registered apprenticeship or other work credential.
However, compare the 45% goal with the fact that in 2021 less than 15% completed the requirements. At the same time, the Apprenticeship program is saddled with problems. Among them: not enough employers; not enough funding; administrative hurdles within school systems; and interagency stumbling blocks.

Lawmakers this year did provide $5 million additional funding per year for two years, but the administrative hurdles remain.
Career Counseling. The Blueprint requires every middle and high school student to receive annually individualized career counseling about job pathways. But here too, daunting obstacles stand in the way of a sky-high goal.
There is tension and confusion in the relative roles of school systems and workforce development boards under the state Department of Labor. Also, the goal of annual individualized counseling is impossible given the woefully limited funds to hire counselors. (Notwithstanding that the General Assembly extended current funding for two years.)
An idea, advanced by Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George’s), is to amend the Blueprint to follow the Swiss model. It provides middle school students with broad exposure but not, as with high school students, individualized guidance. (Rosapepe’s opinions deserve attention. He is the most knowledgeable and dogged voice in Annapolis for CTE.)
The good news is that the involved agencies recognize the problems in the Career Counseling program. The bad news is that there are way too many such agencies. The list includes the Blueprint Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB), the state education department (MSDE), local school systems, state and local workforce development boards, the state CTE Committee and Apprenticeship 2030 Commission, and community colleges.
That is a helluva lot of cooks in the CTE kitchen. The Kirwan Commission intended the CTE Committee under the Governor’s Workforce Development Board to be the executive chef. Its position, influenced by Rosapepe, was that workforce development boards know infinitely more about job markets than school systems; also implicit was a lack of confidence in the competence of MSDE and local school systems.
But, in my view, Apprenticeships and Career Counseling are markedly different in how school systems relate to them. Apprenticeship interactions with employers are beyond the normal orbit of school systems; counseling is a routine school function, and should be entrusted to schools, as advocated by the Public School Superintendents’ Association. The key is for MSDE to develop smart standards, provide strong technical assistance and conduct tough monitoring, including assessing whether there is sufficient collaboration between school systems and workforce development boards.
Rosapepe disagrees. He believes that workforce boards will be stronger and more accountable managers.
What isn’t in dispute is that implementation is falling far short. The MSDE 2024 Blueprint Implementation Plan reveals that CTE is generally lagging. The CTE Committee acknowledges “it will take several years of building programming and capacity.”
Finally, not to pile on but there is a big underlying and sometimes imperceptible hurdle: The widespread perception that CTE is a dumping ground for poorly performing students. John McWhorter, a regular New York Times op-ed contributor, has written: “The idea that in our society the ordinary trajectory after high school is to attend another four years of school has become arbitrary, purposeless and even absurd.” Nonetheless, the absurdity is drummed into the heads of parents, students, and even some educators.
Bravo readers (good job!) if you’ve managed to endure this foray into the deep weeds of CTE. It’s worth it: CTE is indispensable to the future of large numbers of our students, and much more must be urgently done to raise awareness and political support. Its potential, envisioned in the Blueprint, is at great risk.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1461679042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 09:05:48.512772

(Courtesy of Youth Futures)When Shi Alex was couch surfing as a 17-year-old while facing an abusive situation at home, she found Kristen Mitchell, who forever changed the trajectory of her life. 
It started with hot meals. Then she started going to support groups. 
“She always gave me positive regard, no matter what,” Alex said of Mitchell, who at the time was volunteering for a youth outreach program in Ogden. “They just gave me unconditional support, and always made me feel like I was welcome to be there. So that kept me coming back, and eventually it snowballed.” 
Alex, now 29, has spent the last eight years working for a nonprofit that Mitchell co-founded soon after they met. That nonprofit is now known as Youth Futures, which became Utah’s first licensed homeless residential support temporary youth shelter in 2015, starting with 14 temporary overnight beds in downtown Ogden.

Now, after 10 years, Youth Futures also operates overnight youth shelters in two southern Utah cities — St. George and Cedar City — offering not just a safe place to sleep for at-risk kids ages 12 to 18, but also provides meals, clothing, hygiene supplies, laundry services, computer access, and case management every day of the week. The nonprofit aims to reunify families wherever possible, but first and foremost seeks to help kids stay healthy so they can not only survive, but thrive.
“On a day-to-day basis, they’re just keeping you alive,” Alex said. “And if you’re not alive, you can’t recover, no matter what you’re going through. The open doors that they have are keeping so many young people alive and giving them the opportunity to reach their full potential.”
The nonprofit now serves an estimated 60 to 80 kids a day between all of its programs — or about 700 kids a year. 
“The reason we opened was to reduce suicidality and help runaway homeless youth,” Mitchell said. 
But Mitchell told Utah News Dispatch she’s worried that Youth Futures is facing an uncertain future. 
Under President Donald Trump’s administration and federal cuts approved by Congress, nonprofits like hers are facing a chaotic and precarious landscape. Federal funds that Youth Futures relies heavily on are either frozen or potentially on the chopping block. 
Mitchell said she’s stressing on a daily basis about whether she’ll have to cut services or make other “really hard decisions.” 
“The real risk is putting kiddos on the street,” she said. 
To Alex — who has experienced firsthand what Youth Futures can do to help vulnerable Utah kids — the potential of federal funding cuts could threaten not just youth homeless shelter options, but also life-saving services. 
“It would just be so heartbreaking,” she said. “I’m not the first or the last kid that this place has helped. So to have the uncertainty turn into a termination of services, there’s so many kids that are going to have to just rough it without the support. And that’s horrifying.” 
Uncertainty around federal funds for homeless youth
National homeless youth advocates have warned of “very strong uncertainty,” Mitchell said, about whether three-year federal Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) grants will be reauthorized this year in October. 
Faith groups, advocates urge Utah Legislature to fund operations for new family shelter

“This is the largest portion of our operating budget, and without it, it’s going to get really challenging to operate — if we can even continue,” Mitchell said. “If we don’t have enough funds to continue, we’re going to have to cut services (or) staff. And the majority of our staff lives paycheck to paycheck.” 
Under the RHYA Act, Mitchell said her nonprofit receives about $750,000 a year, which equates to about $250,000 for each of Youth Futures’ three locations, which she said each cost about $1.2 million to run. Those federal funds account for about 60% of her operating budget. Donations fund about 30% to 40%, she said. 
RHYA’s appropriations have technically expired, but have previously continued to receive funding under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Education and Workforce. It’s not yet clear whether those authorizations will continue this year. 
Last month, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to fund the government until Sept. 30, but cut $13 billion to non-defense programs and eliminated fiscal year 2025 earmark funding. That included $40 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Children and Family Services programs, according to the National Network for Youth, an organization that advocates for youth homeless service providers in Washington, D.C. 
Because the bill didn’t specify how the cuts should be implemented, “it will be up to the federal agencies to decide what programs some of the broad cuts that the bill dictates will come from,” the advocacy group said in a March 14 post, leading to uncertainty for programs including RHYA. 
“Programs important to youth experiencing homelessness, such as the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, were not explicitly mentioned in the bill,” the post said. “At this time, it’s difficult to say what that may indicate.”

National youth homeless advocates have been urging Congress to pass the Runway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act to reauthorize RHYA’s funds, but it’s not clear if or when it will be considered. 
While Mitchell waits for news about RHYA, other federal funds have already been frozen and taken a bite out of her budget — though not as big of a hit as if RHYA funds aren’t renewed. Phase 42 of the Federal Emergency Food & Shelter funds are frozen, holding up roughly $25,000 to $30,000 that Youth Futures relies on to pay for shelter and meals. Mitchell said she’s not sure how, but she’s working to try to find ways to fill the gap, which could include turning to lines of credit, which would only be a temporary solution. 
“We already fundraise like crazy,” she said, adding that Youth Futures relies heavily on those federal funds, and without them she worries about leaving vulnerable kids without help. “We’re (on) a very tight budget. We run a scrappy organization. I would love it if we didn’t have to be that way, but we have low overhead. And without (federal funds), it really risks our kids.” 
Youth Futures’ funding uncertainty comes at a time when the nonprofit is hitting its 10-year anniversary, having served what Mitchel estimates is more than 6,000 kids. 
“We’re trying to celebrate while having this really big concern for funding, which is extremely stressful,” she said. “We are just really looking for other donations, other contributions, gifts, to help us not have to rely so heavily on those funds.”
What’s at stake
Most of the kids Youth Futures serves come from poverty, Mitchell said, with about a third coming from families that are dealing with financial insecurity or homelessness. She said the nonprofit also helps “kids who have been rejected, kicked out, asked to leave by their parents.” 
“We’ve even seen kids who are dropped off on our doorstep by their parents who … they just don’t know what else to do. They’ve given up,” she said. 
Others come from “family discord” situations, she said, whether that means “religious discord or LGBTQ discord,” or disagreements over family rules and boundaries. 
For a nonprofit that seeks to help kids in areas off the Wasatch Front, like in southern Utah where homeless services for youth can otherwise be scant, Mitchell said she worries that if Youth Futures has to reduce its services, that could mean leaving kids in these areas on the street.

“And that really sucks to have kids not have a place to be,” she said. “We often find kids in caves, in sheds, doubled up in households where there’s way too many people. Kids often getting involved in trafficking to survive. … They’re doing some really rough things, sexual favors and those kinds of things to either get money or a place to sleep or a meal. I mean, those are just terrible things. We really don’t want to go back to that.” 
Alex is not only a former client of Youth Futures, but she’s also now an employee. She worked her way up from a youth advocate, to a street outreach worker, to a case manager, to program manager of the Ogden shelter. She then went on to work in finance for the nonprofit where she wrote grant applications for the very federal dollars now at stake, before working in her current role as a quality assurance analyst, where she writes reports for grants and crunches data for the nonprofit. 
She’s also furthering her education. Alex said she’s on track to finish her master’s in social work. 
But now, Alex said she’s worried about what federal funding cuts could mean for not just herself, but also her colleagues. She said the cloud of uncertainty is causing “so much stress.” 
“The employees are angels. Absolute angels,” she said. “They’re dealing with really difficult situations. And they’re so good at it. So having that specific skill set, we need to fund people to provide those services. And if we don’t have it, everyone will be heartbroken.”

SB 53, sponsored by Sen. Wes Kitchens, R-Arab, l also makes it a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for someone to knowingly transport a person without proper authorization into the state.

Jasmin Hernandez-Alamillo, the community health coordinator for the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, a group that advocates for immigrants, attended the meeting and said he felt “utter devastation” at the vote.
“They are not recognizing human beings as human beings,” he said. “That makes me extremely upset because I come from immigrants. My family are immigrants. I work with immigrants every single day, and they do not see us as humans.”
The committee approved Kitchens’ bill one week after the committee hosted a public hearing in which members heard from several who spoke against the legislation, with one pastor telling the committee it violates Christian values, and a second person saying it could prevent people from obtaining the necessary paperwork to bring their children back to their home country in the event they are deported.
The Senate approved the legislation in February, after the body removed language related to the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, that forced the public to assist slave catchers return people to bondage to the south.
The bill offers several exceptions for people who are transporting people who are not legally authorized to live in the U.S. into Alabama, such as attorneys transporting clients to different immigration facilities or educators escorting their students for a school related activity.
Members of the House Judiciary Committee approved other exemptions to the crime of human smuggling as part of an amendment. One is for health care providers transporting patients, if people are transporting people for religious or charitable reasons, or people that an attorney who represents an individual authorizes.
“Many times people are already afraid of law enforcement and are already afraid to tell them, ‘Hey, something is going on, something is going wrong in my community, I need help.’” Hernandez-Alamillo said. “ Particularly as it involves human trafficking, and I think this will dampen those efforts to try and eliminate that issue in our society.”

The move comes after President Joe Biden, days before leaving office, instructed the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to make the relief efforts permanent.  
Critics of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) COVID relief policy, which allows the agency to front payments on behalf of troubled borrowers, say it’s keeping unqualified borrowers in their homes without making a payment for two to three years, and delaying scarce inventory from going on the market. 
COVID-era mortgage relief, initiated by Trump in 2020 and extended by Biden in 2021, “has created another subprime housing bubble and put taxpayers at risk. Trump should end it,” says a February editorial in the Wall Street Journal. “Under the guise of Covid relief, the Biden administration masked the growing troubles in the housing market by paying off borrowers and mortgage servicers to prevent foreclosures. Of the 52,531 FHA loans last year that went seriously delinquent within their first year, only nine resulted in foreclosure.”

Nationwide one in every 1,515 housing units had a foreclosure filing in the first quarter of 2025, reports ATTOM Data, a real estate analyst.  Nevada ranked third in the nation for the highest rate of foreclosure filings (behind Delaware and Illinois) with one filing for every 874 housing units. 
By comparison, in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, one in 14 Nevada homes received a default notice. 
‘Canary in the coal mine’
The national delinquency rate for all mortgages, which topped 10% during the Great Recession, has been rising for more than a year and edged up to 3.53% in February, according to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), a housing finance company. 
FHA mortgages, which make up less than 15% of all active home loans, but allow higher debt ratios and smaller down payments than other loans, accounted for 90% of the 131,000 home loans that went delinquent last year, ICE reports. 
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, tweeted last month the FHA delinquency rate is “Leading Indicator #2,” behind only consumer confidence on his recession watch, calling it “a proverbial canary in the coal mine…” 
“Not that the financial troubles of FHA borrowers are enough to push the economy into recession. Indeed, high and middle-income mortgage borrowers are having no trouble making their payments at this time – the gap between the FHA delinquency rate and those on Fannie and Freddie loans has never been as large,” Zandi wrote. “But if the economy is headed for trouble, it is FHA borrowers who will signal it first. And they are.”
FHA loans, which are targeted to low-credit, first-time buyers, are a popular option for Nevada borrowers. In 2024, FHA served 766,942 new borrowers nationwide, including just under 11,000 in Nevada, according to its annual report. 
Additionally, some 3,500 Nevadans have received assistance via the FHA relief program in the last three years, according to the website for the Nevada Affordable Home Assistance Corporation’s (NAHAC), which administers relief programs for some 80 lenders. 
‘Extend and pretend’ 
The COVID relief program allows FHA to make payments, called partial claims, (‘partial’ because the payment is not covering the entire debt) on behalf of delinquent borrowers, and add the amount fronted by the government to the back end of the loan, interest free. The FHA payments on behalf of borrowers cannot exceed 30% of a loan’s unpaid principal balance. 
“Consider a borrower who misses five $4,000 monthly mortgage payments,” says the WSJ editorial. “The servicer will add the $20,000 in missed payments to the mortgage and reduce monthly payments by $1,000 for three years—adding another $36,000 to their mortgage. So the borrower is $56,000 deeper in debt, though with no additional interest.”
Mortgage expert John Comiskey projects the FHA “made ~2.6 billion dollars in mortgage payments from these stand alone partial claims last year.” Records analyzed by Comiskey indicate some borrowers made no payments for several years, with the FHA stepping in to bring their loans current every three to four months. 
Comiskey, who calls the effort “an abject FHA loss mitigation policy failure,” tweeted last month that about 70% of some 160,000 FHA Covid relief modifications originated during the past two years are delinquent, and about 55% are seriously delinquent.  
“The extend and pretend music is still playing for these mortgages, though that music now has an end date, and when it stops many of these mortgages will head to foreclosure,” Comiskey wrote last month. On Wednesday, the day after HUD’s announcement, he predicted the end of FHA loss mitigation “will start hitting housing transactions in early ‘26 with maybe some precursor effect late this year.”  
“Let’s not forget the reason why most of these people are in trouble. It’s not because they make bad decisions like in 2008,” says longtime Las Vegas Realtor Steve Hawks, referring to borrowers who purchased multiple properties with no-money-down loans. “They’re in trouble because they can’t afford the cost of living. The home they bought for $300,000 is now $550,000. Their property taxes and home insurance have gone up. The cost of maintenance has gone through the roof. They’re using credit cards for everyday expenses.” 
It’s unknown how many Nevada homeowners will be affected. 
“FHA does not have publicly available information on its home retention solutions by state or dollar amount,” a HUD spokesperson said via email. 
Hawks projects Nevada’s phantom inventory of homes with non-performing loans, but no public record of default, could be in the tens of thousands. 
“It’s not rocket science,” he says, adding the writing was on the wall when home prices soared and inventory dropped in 2021 and 2022. “A lot of people that were going to sell took their houses off the market,” and opted for loan modification and forbearance programs. 











“Let’s not forget the reason why most of these people are in trouble. It’s not because they make bad decisions like in 2008.”

	FHA officials contend the relief has worked, and maintain it is fronting payments on behalf of a small percentage of borrowers. The measures “have proven to be effective in helping struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and reduce losses,” FHA Commissioner Julia Gordan said just days before Biden left office. 
From April of 2020 through September 2024, some 1.7 million FHA borrowers took part in COVID-19 forbearance, according to the agency’s 2024 annual report to Congress. Of those, 77% were able to get back on track, either paying off their loan or becoming current on their mortgages. Some 371,000 borrowers (22%) remained in delinquency or forbearance.
As of September 2024, FHA held active mortgage insurance on 7.81 million single family mortgage loans. The share of FHA borrowers who are seriously delinquent stood at 4.15% in September 2024, a slight increase from a year ago but consistent with rates seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Of some 425,000 loss mitigation actions reported by FHA to Congress in its 2024 annual report, just under 324,000 were partial claims. 
Loan servicers receive a monetary incentive for participating in the relief program – between $500 and $1,750 every time the FHA steps up on behalf of borrowers. 
“The FHA made 556,841 ‘incentive payments’ to servicers over the past year to prevent foreclosures—nearly as many as the new mortgages it insured,” says the WSJ editorial. “Government-backed mortgage relief has become a cash cow for servicers, some of which originated the risky loans they are paid not to foreclose. Moral hazard, anyone?”
Las Vegas real estate expert Tony Ricco says he contacted an FHA lender in an attempt to buy delinquent loans but was turned down. “Why would they sell them? They’re getting paid by the federal government on non-performing loans.” 
Ricco says the level of manipulation in the housing market is preventing “true price discovery” and “is skewing housing to be unaffordable.” 
The end of FHA loss mitigation could see “some additional homes entering the market from the seller’s side as either those borrowers are forced to sell to avoid foreclosure or once the foreclosure is complete,” says Nicholas Irwin, Research Director at UNLV’s Lied Center for Real Estate. “The tricky part is that foreclosed homes become HUD homes and I don’t know how quick the process is from foreclosure to on the market.”
Additional housing supply results in downward pressure on prices, Irwin says. “How much of an effect will depend on how many folks are impacted in our area.”
Unlike 2008, when most properties were privately held, government-sponsored entities such as FHA, the Veterans Administration, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, have skin in the game on about half of all mortgages.
“The government’s not going to foreclose on these people just to put them on another relief program,” Hawks said. “That’s why they’ve been letting them go for this long.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/housing-vista-ronda-aerial-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-17 09:05:48.512772

Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, speaks Tuesday, April 15, 2025, on the floor of the Alaska Senate. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A change to Alaska’s corporate income tax structure is expected to add as much as $65 million per year to the state treasury by diverting money from other states.
The Alaska Senate voted 16-4 on Tuesday to approve Senate Bill 113, which clarifies that online sales to Alaskans amount to business activity within the state.
If passed by the House and approved by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, it would be the state’s first new revenue-generating law in years.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and the sponsor of the bill, said that without the change, businesses can say that the location of an online sale is a server farm or warehouse outside of the state, making it ineligible for Alaska taxation.
Passing the bill is a step toward resolving a major budget deficit, he said, adding that the change won’t have an impact on Alaskans and isn’t a tax increase. Thirty-six other states have adopted similar tax rules.
“It’s about as close as you can get to a unicorn bill to raise money for the state of Alaska,” he said during a news conference on Tuesday.
“It’s a bill that doesn’t raise taxes on Alaskans, doesn’t raise taxes on Alaskan businesses. It’s not going to cost any more simply changing the structure of our corporate income tax. It will probably, quite frankly, shift money from other states to the state of Alaska, and so it’ll be a unicorn. It’s kind of a rarity. There’s probably not too many of these out there,” Wielechowski said.
Sen. Matt Claman, D-Anchorage, said the bill is necessary to modernize the state’s tax system.
“You can get pretty much anything online and it comes to your door, and many of these companies that are doing business here in Alaska pay a little or no corporate income tax due due to what has become, I think, an outdated structure for how we assess companies that are primarily located out of state,” he said.
Opposition came from four Republican members of the Senate minority, including Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, who said she believes it is inappropriate to pass a new revenue measure without also considering changes to the state’s spending cap.
Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, also voted against the bill, saying he doubts Wielechowski’s claims and believes costs will be passed to Alaskans.
“Somewhere, somebody’s paying more money if we’re raising taxes. The businesses are not charities,” he said.
SB 113 has been referred to the House Finance Committee for further hearings.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee approved a bill on Wednesday that would require local school boards to adopt a policy allowing employees and students to voluntarily pray in school.
But the committee made significant changes to HB 231, sponsored by Rep. Reed Ingram, R-Matthews, a constitutional amendment that must be approved by voters if it passes the Legislature. 
As filed, the bill required a daily prayer and specified that the prayer must reflect Judeo-Christian values. A substitute adopted by the committee removed that requirement.
“We took out the Christianity requirement, where if somebody had a different belief, it would be any of their religion,” Ingram said. “And I’m a Christian, and have been, and always will be. But I do respect other religions as well, too, and other people come into this country with different beliefs and that’s their right and opinion.”
Current law generally allows school prayer and religious studies outside of school buildings. Other changes to the bill include that prayers cannot be done in a classroom or during instructional time, and students must get parental consent to participate.
“Prayer has to go on before the school time or after school time. So they would have a room that they could pray in if the school, whatever the school board decided for them to,” he said.
The legislation also requires schools to start each day with the Pledge of Allegiance. If schools do not comply consistently with this requirement, the state superintendent must withhold 25% of state funding. The Legislature will also be authorized to withhold funding from noncompliant schools if they continue to violate the legislation.
“These kids that grow up these days don’t understand what the flag is and what it means. And I think that’s part of the teaching,” he said.
The bill moves to the full House.

The Senate approved the bill earlier this month.
Current law makes it a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison for anyone convicted of a crime of violence, a misdemeanor charge of domestic abuse, someone subject to a protective order or someone of “unsound mind” to possess a firearm. Barfoot’s bill keeps that ban in place but adds new language to extend the ban to anyone charged with those crimes, though they cannot be convicted of possession unless first being convicted of the original crimes they were charged with.
The bill also says the ban applies to anyone convicted of a felony offense “within the previous five years.” It also bans anyone who has three felony convictions from possessing a firearm.
Those who violate the ban may be charged with a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.
The bill also extends a prohibition on carrying deadly weapons “with intent to do bodily harm” to private as well as public schools. It also enhances the criminal penalties for people who shoot into a building with people, going from a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $30,000 fine, to a Class A felony, punishable by up to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The legislation also allows courts to deny bail to those charged with shooting into an occupied building.
The bill leaves in place the penalty for shooting into a building without people at a Class C felony.
Rep. Bryan Brinyark, R-Windham Springs, had concerns with a specific line within the legislation.
‘“A person of ‘unsound mind’, and that is just so vague to me,” he said. “Who makes that decision, it doesn’t break that down. That gives me a little bit of concern but is a good bill. I appreciate what you are doing.”

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Despite growing concerns about an economic downturn, Nevada lawmakers are considering legislation to adjust the commerce tax threshold, a change that would result in less revenue coming into the state.
Nevada businesses are currently subject to the commerce tax on gross revenue above $4 million a year. Assembly Bill 276, sponsored by Republican Assemblymembers P.K. O’Neill and Jill Dickman, would make the threshold a moving target by tying it to inflation and the consumer price index.
The Assembly Revenue Committee gave the bill a hearing in mid-March but took no action until a Friday deadline day The bill passed the committee on a voice vote, with four Democrats opposing.
Expected revenue loss from AB276 would be a miniscule part of the state’s overall budget, but all revenue conversations this legislative session are fraught with anxiety.
Nevada’s Economic Forum in December projected a conservative forecast of $12.4 billion in tax revenue over the next two fiscal years, but acknowledged that Trump’s more grandiose campaign promises — specifically tariffs and mass immigration — had the potential to significantly change the economic outlook. The Economic Forum will meet on May 1 and may adjust that forecast up or down.
“With the economic challenge we’re facing, and the current state of the economy, and the upcoming Economic Forum expectations, I will be voting no on bills abating or negating revenue, which includes this bill,” said Assemblymember Venicia Considine prior to the committee vote on AB276.
Republicans have largely downplayed the possibility of Nevada facing deep financial cuts. Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus at the beginning of the legislative session suggested the state can just “find ways to spend less,” and Gov. Joe Lombardo this month said the state will simply “make adjustments on the fly.”
O’Neill during the bill’s hearing in March called it “fair and effective” because it ensures the commerce tax reflects economic conditions. He and Dickman both served in the Legislature in 2015 when the commerce tax was passed. Dickman voted against it. O’Neill voted for it.
O’Neill said that negotiations at the time focused on ensuring that small businesses were not impacted. He argued that, with time and inflation, businesses the Legislature did not intend to include are now being subject to the tax.
The argument was met with some skepticism from several Democrats on the committee.
“Four million dollars still seems like a pretty large capital business,” remarked Assemblywoman Erica Roth, a Democrat from Reno. Roth also voted against advancing the bill out of committee.
Michael Nakamoto, chief principal deputy fiscal analyst for the Legislature’s nonpartisan staff, noted that 8,226 taxpayers paid $341.1 million in commerce tax in fiscal year 2024. 
The average three-year inflation rate preceding that tax year was 5%. If the threshold proposed in AB276 were in effect, 145 of those businesses would not have had to pay the commerce tax, while the remainder would have only had to pay on gross revenue above $4.2 million instead of $4 million. 
That would have resulted in approximately $1.6 million less in revenue for the state, according to Nakamoto.
Supporters of the bill include the Nevada Trucking Association, the Nevada Franchised Auto Dealers Association, and the Vegas Chamber.
Assemblymember Danielle Gallant, a Republican from Henderson, said during the bill’s hearing that she supports the bill — “something’s better than nothing” — and asked the bill sponsors if they’d contemplated something “more aggressive.”
“If I had my way, I’d take the tax out but it has become part of our budget,” said O’Neill in his response, adding with the bill he is attempting to find a simple and succinct way to move forward with a tax that was heavily negotiated a decade ago.

Honolulu and Phoenix tied for the lowest effective rate (0.37%), followed by Nashville (0.48%), Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, (both 0.48%). 
Nevada has the ninth lowest property tax rate in the nation among states. Nevada’s 790,939 single-family homes have an average value of $595,116 and an average annual property tax bill of $2,856 – a .48% effective tax rate. 
Nevada property tax is calculated via a complicated formula based on assessed value, rather than market value. Local governments have long complained that the state’s 3% cap on increases in assessed value on residential property, and 8% cap on assessed value increases in commercial property values, render municipalities challenged to provide basic services, such as fire services and education. Efforts to tweak the complicated formula have failed. 
States with the lowest taxes are in the southern and western United States, ATTOM reports. 
Hawaii had the lowest property tax rate (0.33%), followed by Idaho, Arizona, and Alabama ( all at 0.41%), and Delaware (0.43%).
Utah came in sixth (0.45%), followed by Tennessee (0.46%), West Virginia (0.47%), Nevada (0.48%), and Wyoming (0.49%).
Tax rates in the Northwest U.S. are the highest, thanks to more valuable homes and higher tax rates, according to ATTOM’s report. 
Illinois has the highest rate in the nation (1.87%), followed by New Jersey (1.59%), Connecticut (1.48%), Nebraska (1.32%), and Ohio (1.31%).
New Jersey has the highest average tax bill at $10,135, followed by Connecticut ($8,402), New Hampshire ($7,723), Massachusetts ($7,720), and California ($7,131).
Average property tax bills topped more than $10,000 a year in 19 counties. Bastrop County, TX had the highest bill ($28,297), followed by Marin County, CA ($15,881), Essex County, NJ ($13,989), Bergen County, NJ ($13,961), and San Mateo County, CA ($13,627).

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s next governor may inherit a new property tax cut program aimed at seniors, but the candidates don’t all embrace it as is.
Some of the 11 candidates hoping to become our next chief executive say income limits for the program — called Stay NJ — are too generous. Others worry the state’s uncertain fiscal outlook makes the program unfeasible unless it’s revamped. One candidate, Republican Bill Spadea, called Stay NJ a “gimmick” that should be eliminated outright.
“We cannot continue with smoke and mirrors that shift the tax burden from one group to another while calling it a tax cut,” Spadea said in a statement from his campaign.
Democratic lawmakers have been promising Stay NJ for years, saying it will be essential to keep senior citizens from fleeing to states with lower taxes. But budget experts have issued private and public warnings about the program’s price tag, which is expected to top $1 billion annually.
“The state just can’t afford to pay for it,” Richard Keevey, a former state budget director and comptroller, told the New Jersey Monitor.
StayNJ was signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy in 2023, but it is not scheduled to begin delivering payments to eligible taxpayers until 2026. The program will offer homeowners 65 and over tax credits to make up for half of their property tax bills, capped at $6,500. Homeowners must make less than $500,000 annually to qualify.
Stay NJ payments could go out just as a new governor takes office in January. Murphy, a Democrat, cannot seek a third term this November, and six Democrats and five Republicans are running to succeed him.
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, has called Stay NJ “inherently flawed and regressive.” In a statement from his campaign, Baraka said it “must be overhauled or dismissed,” and took aim at the program’s half-a-million-dollar income limit. 
“We need to direct government resources toward lifting all boats, not just those already floating comfortably. That means capping rents, building more housing, and investing in real solutions for affordability across the board. Our state budget should reflect our values: working people, not the wealthy, should be first in line for help,” he said.
Two of Baraka’s Democratic rivals — Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop and Rep. Mikie Sherrill — noted that statutory language bars the state from issuing Stay NJ payments if certain fiscal goals are not met, like maintaining a surplus that is at least 12% of annual spending (lawmakers could override that provision, and did last year).
Speaking at a press conference in Edison this week, Fulop said “of course we’re not going to stand in the way of a 50% tax reduction for residents” if the state finds a way to fund Stay NJ while keeping its surplus above 12%. But the more likely outcome, he said, is that the program won’t work.
Fulop has proposed either restructuring Stay NJ by lowering the income threshold to $150,000 and making the award a flat amount based on income rather than a percentage of property taxes paid, or implementing a new program to provide all homeowners with a single tax credit that limits a homeowner’s property taxes “to an affordable percentage of their income.”
“We’re going to clean that up to make sure there’s real property tax reform for residents here throughout New Jersey,” he said.
Sherrill told reporters in Bloomfield last month that she thinks StayNJ is a “great program” for seniors. But in a statement from her campaign on Wednesday, she noted the state’s budget issues.
“We have no way to know what state revenues will look like in 12 to 15 months or how much needed federal funding will be ripped away by Trump. However, there are things we must do like fully fund the pension system and protecting direct property tax relief is of equal importance. It is the most direct way our state government can create affordability for New Jerseyans,” Sherrill said.
Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05) has pledged to cut all New Jerseyans’ property tax bills by a dramatic 15%. Gottheimer in a statement from his campaign said he supports Stay NJ, but wants to add additional tax relief, including a $1,000 “senior bonus” for seniors who have lived in New Jersey for at least a decade before turning 70 and an annual tax rebate for renters.
“I’m the only candidate with a tax cut plan that meets our pension obligations, tackles our structural deficit, and is fully paid for without cutting the important programs and services Jersey families and seniors rely on,” he said.
Democrat Sean Spiller, president of the statewide teachers union, said he supports StayNJ. Spiller said in a statement from his campaign that he wants to streamline the state’s multiple tax credit programs and make sure benefits get to people who need them most “without the challenging layers of bureaucracy and redundancies.” Stay NJ benefits would be paid out only if homeowners do not already see their tax bill cut in half by the existing Anchor and senior freeze tax relief programs.
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney, a Democrat, announced Wednesday he wants to slash the income limit for Stay NJ to $250,000 and eliminate income tax for seniors 65 and up with annual incomes of $250,000 or less. He calls his plan “Stay NJ Plus.”
“Our seniors deserve the peace of mind that comes with financial stability,” Sweeney said in a statement from his campaign. “By capping the Stay NJ program at $250,000, we can ensure a fair distribution of resources while continuing to support the goal of keeping our cherished residents in their homes.”
Republican Mario Kranjac, a former mayor of Englewood Cliffs, is open to keeping Stay NJ on a transitional basis,” but if elected governor, he would aim to cut spending and slash taxes, “making the State more affordable for everyone without special programs primarily designed to buy votes,” said his campaign manager, Michael Byrne.
Republican state Sen. Jon Bramnick said he supports Stay NJ and believes senior citizens deserve tax relief.
“I still support the program but if the Democrats were truly serious about reducing the property tax burden they would have started the program immediately, not three years after passage,” Bramnick said.
Former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican, did not respond to a request for comment.

Two different Missouri judges have now determined that he is actually innocent.
Dunn was convicted in 1991 for the fatal shooting of 14-year-old Rico Rodgers. He was also found guilty of two counts of assault and three counts of armed criminal action. The conviction was based on testimony from two teenage eyewitnesses who later recanted, stating they were pressured by police. No physical evidence ever linked Dunn to the crime scene.
In 2020, Judge William Hickle reviewed Dunn’s case during a habeas corpus proceeding. Although Missouri law at the time did not allow relief in non-death penalty cases, Hickle wrote that Dunn had met the legal threshold for innocence and that no reasonable juror would convict him based on the current evidence.
Four years later, a relatively new innocence statute was in place in Missouri, and the St. Louis Circuit Attorney used it to filed a motion to vacate Dunn’s conviction.  Judge Jason Sengheiser held an evidentiary hearing and reached the same conclusion as Hickle, finding clear and convincing evidence of actual innocence.
Dunn was released from prison on July 30, 2024, after serving 33 years.
Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed the ruling, arguing that the state has a legal interest in preserving the finality of its convictions. In his filings, Bailey emphasized that overturning decades-old cases could erode public confidence in the justice system and create instability in criminal law. On Tuesday, the Missouri Supreme Court agreed, ruling that the state is an aggrieved party under Missouri’s civil appeals statute and may challenge the judgment.
The case now returns to the Missouri Court of Appeals.
The decision has drawn sharp criticism from legal advocates and reformers who believe the ruling prioritizes institutional preservation over the truth.
“Let’s be honest, this is not about public safety or accountability for the victim’s family. It is about maintaining control,” said one innocence advocate. “Two separate courts have said Christopher Dunn is innocent, yet the state continues to fight to keep him labeled a murderer.”
The family of Rico Rodgers, the 15-year-old who Dunn was convicted of killing in 1990, has waited more than 30 years for justice. But attempting to re-incarcrate someone who has been twice declared innocent will not bring peace. It further delays the opportunity to identify the true perpetrator and pursue meaningful accountability.
While the attorney general argues that vacating convictions may undermine public trust, many see it differently.

(Courtesy of state of Indiana)An Indiana woman wants to sue the doctor who secretly used his own sperm to inseminate her mother, rather than the sperm provided by her father. But the question of when she was obligated to investigate her suspicions must first be decided by the Indiana Court of Appeals. 
Justices heard the case during a Wednesday hearing, and will rule soon on whether the woman can continue to pursue a lawsuit, despite the state’s two-year statute of limitations. 
 Former Indianapolis Dr. Donald Cline (Mugshot from the Marion County Sheriff’s Office)
The medical malpractice case centers on Dr. Donald Cline, the former Indianapolis fertility specialist who in 2017 admitted to using his own sperm to inseminate patients without their knowledge — or consent — during the 1970s and 1980s. DNA testing has since revealed that he deceptively fathered more than 90 children.
Attorneys and court documents all but name Cline in the latest legal proceedings. 
The plaintiff — referred to as “Anonymous Child 1” — definitively learned of her biological connection to Cline in 2022. She preferred to keep her identity hidden, however, “because her father, as we sit here today, does not know that he is not her father,” said Kent Winningham, the anonymous woman’s lawyer.
An “Anonymous Healthcare Group” is listed as second defendant alongside Cline.
Cline’s counsel argued Wednesday that the woman had a reasonable obligation to investigate in 2019, after widespread news reports revealed the doctor had used his own sperm to inseminate multiple patients. 
Winningham refuted, saying his client acted “promptly” after receiving DNA results from a 23andMe test kit three years later.
Arguments before the court
Cline treated the woman’s parents for fertility issues in 1985 “and was supposed to use sperm from Anonymous Child’s father to inseminate Anonymous Child’s mother,” according to court documents. 
The plaintiff’s counsel said it wasn’t until 2019 that she saw news reports indicating Cline had been accused of using his own sperm to inseminate some of his patients, rather than using third-party donor sperm.
At that time, however, Cline had not yet been accused of using his own sperm to inseminate patients where the patient’s spouse — not a third party — provided sperm for insemination.
Winningham said his client initially “thought it was unfathomable” that Cline could be her biological father because her parents didn’t use donor sperm. Although other patients had made allegations against the doctor, “those patients had undergone different procedures than her mother,” he said.
“She always thought she looked like her dad, and had always been told she looked like her paternal aunt, as well, based on the fact that her parents did not use a sperm donor. The doctor told them, ‘I’m using your dad, your husband’s sperm,’” Winningham told Indiana Court of Appeals judges on Wednesday. “She reasonably thought that, ‘OK, there is a group of people that have been affected — people who used sperm donors. Thank God my parents did not use a sperm donor.’ … Then when she found new information, she acted immediately.”
It was in 2022 that the woman viewed a trailer for the 2022 Netflix documentary “Our Father,” which highlighted the ethical and legal issues surrounding his actions.​










She reasonably thought that, ‘OK, there is a group of people that have been affected — people who used sperm donors. Thank God my parents did not use a sperm donor.’ … Then when she found new information, she acted immediately.


– Kent Winningham, the anonymous woman’s lawyer


“As soon as she realized, ‘Oh my gosh, he actually did this to people who believed their husband’s sperm was used, as well,’ she got a DNA test right away, and she filed her case within 20 days of getting those results,” Winningham continued. “Those are the acts of someone that is using, I think, reasonable diligence and promptness.”
But a trial court disagreed, ruling in July 2024 that the woman’s two-year clock for legal remedy began on Dec. 31, 2019, at which point she was “aware that she was conceived through infertility treatment, that Anonymous Physician was her parents’ infertility doctor, and that Anonymous Physician had allegedly used his own sperm to (impregnate) patients.”
Judge Elaine Brown additionally questioned why the woman “didn’t do anything” to investigate her DNA earlier.
“There’s no law that supports that someone has the responsibility to watch the news, and based on allegations in the news of a different subset of people, that means I’ve got to go file a case,” Winningham argued. “And that’s not good for our judicial system, either — for people to file cases blindly, based on allegations others make against a physician their parents may have treated with.”
Cline’s attorney pushes back
Meg ​​Christensen, one of Cline’s attorneys, held that the woman had “due diligence … to investigate her DNA in 2019,” because that’s when she learned “there was a possibility” that Cline could be her biological father. 
“At that point, it’s undisputed that she knew that (Cline) had used his own sperm to inseminate multiple patients, deceiving those patients,” Christensen said.
Brown wondered if “a possibility of some medical malpractice” alone should require “reasonable diligence” to investigate if malpractice had, in fact, occurred.
“Suspicion alone is not enough to file, but it is enough to trigger the obligation to investigate,” Christensen replied. “(In case law) you see the trigger date being tied to the date that the plaintiff had enough information to suspect that there might have been malpractice.”

Even so, Brown further questioned if the woman “had enough information that required her to diligently look into it” in 2019.
“If the law is that we have to know exactly what the plaintiff knew about what was being said to third parties, then the statute of limitations really doesn’t have much in the way of teeth,” Christensen said in response. 
“What we do know is that the plaintiff knew the physician treated her mother. The physician deceived multiple patients by using his own sperm and lying to them at the time and never disclosing it, and that he had continued to lie to members of the public and to other children conceived through this procedure,” the lawyer added. “With that knowledge, reasonable diligence requires her to do the thing that is only in her control to do. She is the only one who can do anything to further the investigation. Any reasonable person would proceed with some investigation.”
The judges additionally probed whether that burden should “be put on the plaintiff in a case such as this.”
Christensen pointed to the plaintiff’s earlier deposition, during which the woman discussed her early “denials” about Cline in a Facebook group for half-siblings fathered by the doctor.
“She says, ‘Well, how come we didn’t think it could apply to us? No one wants to think about something that horrific applying to you. That’s why I said it was outright denial. It couldn’t apply to us. It’s too unfathomable,’” Christensen quoted from the deposition. “She’s not saying, ‘I didn’t believe it applied to me.’ She’s saying, ‘I didn’t want it to, and I didn’t want to think about it because it was hard, and it is emotionally fraught.’ But that is not a reason to extend her timeline to investigate, unfortunately.”
Background on Cline
The woman’s legal team wants the Court of Appeals to return the matter to the lower court and allow the case to move forward. There’s no timeline for the appeals panel to issue a ruling.
Cline’s actions came to light in 2014, when another woman who was conceived via donor sperm discovered multiple half-siblings through at-home DNA testing. The discovery led to a broader investigation, and in 2017, Cline pleaded guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice for lying to investigators. He received a one-year suspended sentence. 
At the time, Indiana law did not specifically prohibit fertility doctors from using their own sperm without patient consent.​
The case prompted Indiana lawmakers to enact legislation in 2019 criminalizing fertility fraud, making it a Level 6 felony offense. The legislature also created a civil cause of action for fertility fraud, which enables the plaintiff to be awarded compensatory and punitive damages, or liquidated damages of $10,000.
The law is not retroactive, though — which is why Winningham said his client is seeking a malpractice case.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — For South Carolina inmates, Easter baskets take the form of clear bags stuffed with soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste, notebooks, pens, envelopes and hard candy.
Twice a year, Baptist churches across the state donate enough supplies for each of the state’s prisoners to receive a baggie of toiletries and other small items. Earlier this month, about 50 volunteers, many of them prison chaplains, packed the donations into more than 16,300 bags that went to inmates in all 21 prisons.

The bags may not seem like much to many people, but inmates look forward to them every year, volunteers said.
The prison system provides basic necessities, but many inmates can’t afford anything beyond those, like good-smelling soap and candy, said Pamela Nates, a chaplain at Kirkland Correctional Institution’s maximum security unit.
“These things are like gold for them,” Nates said.
Many inmates try to make the items last as long as possible, Nates said.
The springtime packages came several months after every inmate received an identical package at Christmastime.
The bags aren’t just about extra supplies. The prisoners get a boost from knowing people outside the prison care enough to spend time and money assembling gift bags for them. Working inside the prisons, Nates has seen the way inmates’ faces light up when they receive the packages, she said.
“They feel so isolated and are in their own little world behind the bars,” Nates said. “To know that someone on the outside is caring enough to do this is a tremendous lift for them. It gives them hope.”
Many inmates may not have had access to similar supplies even outside of prison, making the gifts extra special, Nates said.
During her six years working with inmates, she has seen the way people can change while in prison if given the proper support, and resources like the gift bags are part of that, she said.
“I believe in my heart that part of the reason they’re there is because they weren’t cared for,” Nates said. “They weren’t given the basic needs, you know, toothpaste, soap, a toothbrush.”

Volunteers had already established a rhythm in packing their bags by about 9 a.m. on April 8.
Trucks packed with supplies pulled up to the front of the Bethlehem Baptist Church building. Police officers called for some of the 10 inmates brought from the minimum-security Manning Reentry and Work Release Center to unload them.
A couple inmates, dressed in tan jumpsuits, stacked bags and boxes of supplies along one wall of a yellow-painted gymnasium. Others brought those supplies to the folding tables set up throughout the room, where volunteers dumped out their contents, sorting them and packing them into plastic baggies.
Those baggies went into navy blue sacks that chaplains delivered to inmates the next day.
Unlike other programs, inmates can receive the gift bags regardless of their disciplinary record. However, the goal is still to encourage good behavior by reminding inmates that there is hope for them when they leave, said Corrections Director Bryan Stirling.
“It gives them incentive to still behave and a connection on the outside, to know that there are people out there that want to contribute and give them toiletries but are also praying for them,” Stirling said.

The supplies and volunteers came from the Baptist Educational and Missionary Convention’s approximately 1,100 member churches across the state. Their faith inspired them to do as much as possible to help others less fortunate, said Michael Cannon, a chaplain at eight Midlands prisons.
One verse from the book of Matthew in particular guided him: “When I was in prison, you visited me,” said Cannon, who is also a member of the Baptist convention at Piney Grove Missionary Baptist Church.
“We want to be in line with the Scripture, to be a blessing to the inmate population by giving them gifts and showing them love to support what the Scripture says,” Cannon said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3745-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 08:05:10.266526

From coast to coast, devastating fires and hurricanes have destroyed homes and livelihoods and changed the landscape of  our country. 
Closer to home, we’ve grown used to extreme weather and breathing the toxic air that wafts east from fires out West. 
Too many politicians have ignored these changes in the face of fossil fuel companies flooding the political and media ecosystem with cash and disinformation, and it’s at times driven us to hopelessness.
As high school seniors, we’re rejecting hopelessness and channeling these frustrations into action.  
Our climate club started seven years ago, when we were in sixth grade. Although we were young, we were aware of the environmental damage occurring all around us. But seeing reduced snowfall in the winters and experiencing the warming of Lake Superior spurred us to do something. We eventually decided that getting solar panels for our school would be a good first step. 
Our original plan was to encourage our district leaders to install a 40 kilowatt solar array on our middle school, enough to offset the electricity used by the gym lights. We researched, collaborated with energy experts from the city, and presented our findings to the Duluth School Board. 
Despite the energy savings and carbon reduction the panels would bring, it was too expensive. 
We didn’t let that stop us though. We sought solutions. We went to the Legislature, and lobbied and testified for the passage of the Solar for Schools Grant, a program providing funding to schools across Minnesota for solar panels. To this day, over 150 schools in the state have used this resource.
When the pandemic arrived, we were frequently out of school and our club’s numbers suffered as a result. 
Last year, however, we restarted the club with renewed passion. We quickly gained nearly 30 members and continued to pursue our original goal of solar for our district. Again, we researched, worked with professionals, and worked up a plan.
Last June, we spoke at a school board listening session and explained the risks of the climate crisis to all of us, as well as the opportunity in solar and for Duluth to become a leader in renewable energy.
We discussed how the Solar for Schools Grant and Inflation Reduction Act (now at risk from the Trump administration) would drastically reduce the price of a solar array, large or small. 
We got the school district on board with a project, and they have since submitted an application for the Solar for Schools Grant. They are planning on pursuing an array of about 100 kilowatts on the administration building, which is smaller than we hoped for, but is still a step in the right direction. Hopefully, our school district will recognize the environmental and economic benefit of solar, and install more in the future. 
As young people, we are constantly reminded that we will be the generation to fix climate change. (The headlines and horror stories and our own personal experiences are reminders enough; you all can stop telling us now!) We also want to stress that combating climate change will require hard work from all of us, not just young people. 
From our seven years of work on this project, we have learned that everyone and anyone can pitch in, but putting ideas into practice takes work. 
We all need to start doing more and pushing others to do more. 
One easy thing everyone can do is banish hopelessness and demoralization. These mentalities, although they are often our initial reaction to bad news, only give us an excuse for inaction.

(Photo by Reinaldo Diaz of Lake Worth Waterkeeper)There used to be a TV game show called “To Tell the Truth.” It ran from 1956 to 1968, then was revived in syndication in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. Then, because network TV executives seldom have new ideas, ABC brought it back in 2016 for a six-year revival. We’ll probably see it again in the next decade.
The game worked like this: Three contestants would all claim to be the same person. Two were impostors willing to lie up a storm, while the real one was required to tell the truth. The celebrity panel had to guess which was which.
I thought of that old game show the other day while watching the Florida Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources run a confirmation hearing. In the hot seat: the sitting chairman of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Rodney Barreto.
Over the past 20 years, Barreto has been appointed to the commission by three different governors — Jeb Bush, Charlie Crist, and Ron DeSantis — which suggests governors are as unoriginal as network execs. This was Barreto’s fourth confirmation hearing, and by far the roughest, because mobs of people contacted the senators to urge them to reject him.
After Barreto swore to tell the truth, senators asked him about the objections people had raised. Some were angry that he voted to allow a toll road to be built through a Central Florida preserve. Some were upset about the wildlife commission’s push for another bear hunt. Others were mad about his advocacy of the purposely misleading Amendment 2.
But there was one exchange that I found particularly fascinating.
Barreto makes his living as a developer and lobbyist. Sen. Gayle Harrell asked him if he was trying to build condominiums on submerged land on Singer Island in Palm Beach County.
Barreto acknowledged that he owns property there but swore he wasn’t trying to build anything.
“I don’t know who’s telling you that I’m building condos there,” he testified. “There’s not one application in front of any governing body.”
When Harrell asked him if he’d ever tried to build on his submerged land, he told her, “Never.” Then he stood there defiantly, as if about to break into the Eurythmics song “Would I Lie To You?”
The committee moved on. I regret to report that nobody brought up the fact that, in 2021, the Palm Beach Post ran a story about Barreto headlined, “Top Florida wildlife official wants to fill, build on lagoon where turtles, manatees roam.”
“Florida’s top appointed protector of wildlife wants to make millions by dredging up and filling in acres of the wildlife-filled Lake Worth Lagoon,” the story begins. “Rodney Barreto … is pressing legal action to let his company fill, dredge and build hundreds of condos and houses on mostly submerged land off Singer Island.”
Maybe he didn’t intend to say something so blatantly untrue while he was under oath. Maybe he’s just so busy developing land that he forgot about this one controversial project.
Others offered a different theory.

“He’s just used to getting his way,” said Lesley Blackner, a Stuart attorney and longtime foe of Florida sprawl who testified against Barreto. “And not being questioned.”
 The mission of the commission
Barreto isn’t some clueless outsider who’s swooped in to destroy Florida’s environment. He’s from here.
“When I grew up in Miami,” he told the Senate committee, “I hunted in the Everglades and went fishing in Biscayne Bay. … It was the best time of my life.”
Now he’s a millionaire who owns property in four states, chaired the Miami Super Bowl Host Committee three times, and routinely hobnobs with well-known politicians, raising beaucoup bucks for them and their causes.
“I’m in the business of making money,” he told the senators.
This is not how the wildlife commission started in 1998. Back then, the commissioners included a wildlife biologist, a dentist, a cattle rancher, an insurance executive, a charter boat captain, a retired sheriff, and a defense attorney.
The difference, I think, is that the governor who appointed that first board, Lawton Chiles, limited his campaign contributions to $100 maximum. Now the appointees are all big-money boys reaping the benefits of being major contributors to the governor.
“It’s all quid pro quo now,” Blackner said.
The problem with filling the board with campaign contributors in the real estate and development business, though, is that they’re likely to have projects that conflict with the mission of the commission.
Take the project Sen. Harrell asked Barreto about. He bought his property in 2016 for $425,000. Two years later, under the name of a company run by Barreto and his wife called Government Lot 1 LLC, he filed an application to build 330 condos, 15 single family homes, 30 boat slips, and a 50-slip marina with a restaurant and community center.
To build this would require dumping fill in 12 acres of submerged land and dredging 4 acres of the submerged property. This is a style of destructive development we seldom see in Florida anymore.

The place where it would be built, by the way, is adjacent to John D. MacArthur Beach State Park, which Reinaldo Diaz, of Lake Worth Waterkeeper, calls “one of the best state parks in the state.”
As for the property Barreto wanted to develop, it has “the highest density of juvenile sea turtles in at least the east coast of Florida,” Diaz told me. “Nearby is the only significant horseshoe crab nesting site I’ve found in the Lake Worth Lagoon”
That spot is so full of wildlife, he said, because Barreto’s property consists of “nothing but seagrass and a strip of mangroves.”
 Water into land
Until about 50 years ago, Florida developers believed the best way to build a new waterfront subdivision was to do what Barreto was proposing: Create new land out of water.
They would dump fill on the submerged property, turning water into dry land, meanwhile burying mangroves and seagrass aucods galore.
  Leroy Collins via Florida State Archives
In St. Petersburg, for instance, so many developers had built dredge-and-fill subdivisions on Boca Ciega Bay by 1957 that Gov. LeRoy Collins quipped, “Pretty soon, we’re going to have to drill to find water here.”
When Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972, the new Environmental Protection Agency used it to stop a harmful dredge-and-fill project in Florida.
Harbor Isles was to be built on the edge of Tampa Bay by using 1.3 million cubic yards of fill dirt to create 281 acres of dry land. It would destroy what biologists called “a rich estuarine area.”
The EPA won that case. Then it won seven more in the Florida Keys, laying the groundwork for ending such destructive development, not just in Florida but nationwide.
Because Barreto’s development project was a throwback to the bad old days, it did not get a warm reception from the state.
One of the agencies to which he applied for a permit, the South Florida Water Management District, sent back a 17-page letter that basically said, “Dude, you have GOT to be kidding.”
Noting the serious impact on “an unknown amount of open water, submerged bottom, mangrove and seagrass habitats,” the staff wrote that they had “considerable concerns” and would likely say no.
Barreto withdrew the application — but he was far from done with the project.
For the next step, he basically tried to resurrect the dead.
 The last thing
Despite the Clean Water Act, some would-be developers had already secured permits for using the old-fashioned building method. Government officials had to negotiate a way to stop them. The settlements they worked out made sure that kind of rampant destruction faded.
In 2020, Barreto filed a legal motion to reopen one of those old cases. He asked the court to revive this long-settled matter so his Singer Island project could be declared exempt from modern environmental regulations and he could proceed to build.
He joined with two other owners of submerged property to legally object to the Riviera Beach commissioners rezoning their land for preservation. That would prevent their development plans, they argued.
These efforts backfired when the Palm Beach Post reported that the lead defender of Florida’s wildlife was also the guy trying to destroy a bunch of it. A public uproar ensued. People demanded he either drop his development plans or resign.
  Lesley Blackner via screen grab
“It’s not just any part of the lagoon, it is absolutely the best part, in terms of its environment,” Lisa Interlandi of the Everglades Law Center said during an FWC board meeting at the time.
To quiet everyone down, Barreto dismissed his legal challenges and told the Miami Herald he would immediately sell the property.
However, it appears that his promise to sell the land was another — oh, what’s that word that’s the opposite of “true?” It’s right on the tip of my tongue.
Rather than sell the land, Barreto’s corporation hung onto it. He still owns it. He testified to the Senate committee that his only plan was to use it as “mitigation” to make up for someone else’s mangrove-destroying development plans.
But a more recent Barreto lawsuit tells a different story.
Last year, Barreto’s corporation sued Riviera Beach over the property. Barreto contended that by rezoning the land so it could not be developed, the commissioners had in effect taken it from him and he demanded to be paid. That lawsuit is still pending.
I contacted Interlandi about all this. She told me: “The last thing Florida’s submerged lands need is people trying to get rich off them.  I think this is a great opportunity to pivot and focus on land conservation, not land development.”
I tried to contact Barreto to ask him about that.
I should warn you that this is where the story gets weird.
 Sign on the line
I have interviewed Barreto several times in the past. For some reason, he didn’t return my calls this week. Probably too busy raising money for DeSantis’ new foundation, “Hope Florida Doesn’t Find Out.”
Instead, to my surprise, I heard from someone who claimed to be Barreto’s partner in owning the submerged land. And it wasn’t his wife.
His name is Glenn Larson. He’s president of a Miami company called Dock & Marine Construction that’s been around since 1959.
Larson told me he’d known Barreto ever since the future mover-and-shaker was a police officer. He said he also built the Barretos’ backyard docks.
This is the one and only time they’ve been partners in anything, Larson told me. He just happened to bump into Barreto while he was considering buying the submerged land and Barreto agreed to join forces with him, Larson said.
Barreto didn’t mention him to the Senate committee and Larson’s name doesn’t appear anywhere in the property records. I asked him if he had any paperwork to show he’s a partner.
“I’m the half-owner, but when they recorded the deed, they left my name off of it,” he told me. In other words, no.
The attorney who filed the deed was going to correct that oversight, he said. But that’s when Larson — not Barreto! — filed the application to build all those houses and condos on the property, he said.
“I kind of messed him up,” Larson told me.
When the water district sent back that letter with all the conditions, he told me, “Rodney called me and said, ‘What the hell are you doing, man?’ So, I withdrew it.”
Larson insisted that Barreto had no knowledge of the development plans, and that’s why his answers to Sen. Harrell were not perjury.
  Barreto’s signature on the permit application via SFWMD
Hang on a second, I said. The signature on the permit application looks like Barreto’s, not yours. You’re just listed as a contractor.
He acknowledged that Barreto did sign the permit application.
“I probably went and left the paperwork at his house to get his signature,” Larson said. “But he didn’t know what I was doing.”
I find it hard to believe Barreto, a hard-headed businessman if ever there was one, would sign any document without reading it.
Anyway, despite all the people who urged them to kick Barreto to the curb, the Senate committee voted 8-1 to confirm him for another term as a wildlife commissioner. Even Sen. Harrell voted for him.
Barreto has yet to appear before his second and final Senate hearing, this time with the Ethics and Elections Committee. The hearing hasn’t been scheduled yet, so he’s got some time to consider what answers he’ll give. I promise we can handle the truth.

Doug Beck, D-Affton, speaks to reporters in April 2022 (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Missouri Democrats stonewalled a Republican effort to roll back a voter-approved paid sick leave law, blocking action in the Senate for more than nine hours before GOP leadership adjourned the chamber around 1 a.m. Thursday.
A bill sponsored by state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a Republican from Jefferson City, would gut Proposition A, a voter-approved law requiring most employers to provide paid sick time off for hundreds of thousands of qualifying workers starting May 1. 
Bernskoetter said Proposition A “creates a one-size-fits-all” solution that would hurt businesses.
“An agreement to exchange time and talent for wages and other benefits is a contract between employee and employer, so I don’t really think we should be getting in the middle of that,” Bernskoetter said, adding that voters may not have understood the extent of the law from the ballot summary.
The bill passed out of the House last month on a vote of 96 to 51. If the Senate approves the bill, it will head to the governor’s desk. 
The bill would also modify the minimum wage law by removing the requirement that it be indexed to inflation.
Democrats began filibustering the bill shortly after Berskoetter brought it to the floor Wednesday, just before 4 p.m.
Senate Democratic Leader Doug Beck of Affton has called the issue of overturning Prop A a “red line.”
“When I say I stand up for working families and workers, I take that seriously,” Beck said. 
Beck said he and Republican leadership worked on a compromise dealing with “some details of implementation” that was then upended.
“I’m going to continue those negotiations, and we’ll see what we can do, if we can come to some sort of conclusion. Maybe. Again, we might not,” Beck said when the filibuster began.
Bernskoetter told him: “There’s just a lot of businesses that are affected by this all over our state, and it’s just a cumbersome process. I’m sure we can come to some kind of a solution.”

Proposition A passed with over 57% of the vote in Missouri, including rural, suburban and urban counties. 
As he began the Democratic filibuster Wednesday evening, Beck ticked through each Senate district’s vote totals, noting that it passed in 20 of the chamber’s 34 districts, including 11 represented by Republicans. 
“This is literally a mandate,” Beck said, from the voters. “…The voters were never deceived.”
State Sen. Angela Mosley, a St. Louis Democrat, said the bill “will send a message back to their constituents that their public input doesn’t matter.” 
The legislature should wait to see what the impact is before intervening, said Democratic state Sen. Steve Roberts of St. Louis.
“What was passed was reasonable, it’s fair and it’s what our constituents want,” he said.
State Sen. Tracy McCreery, an Olivette Democrat, said the legislature continues helping the wealthiest, including through the proposed capital gains tax cut the Senate passed last week.
“We’re doing a lot of things to help Missourians that are at the 1% of the 1%, or the people that are very, very fortunate. But then we’re just piling things on and just doing everything we can, it feels like we’re just kicking and going after regular working families…And you know, we’re doing things that just continue to just make it harder for people to make ends meet each and every month.”
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican, said the passage of Prop A is evidence of the problems with Missouri’s initiative petition process, which he said puts major policy decisions in the hands of voters rather than the government they elected to represent them. It should’ve never gone to the people for a vote, he said.
“This is one of those things, of the problem with direct democracy,” Brattin said. “This is exactly what our founders were expressively against when they formed this nation.”
He said small businesses won’t be able to absorb the costs. 
“The people casting the ballots for measures such as this, they have no skin in the game whatsoever, when it comes to these sorts of measures,” Brattin said. “No realization of the detriment, or the harm that it may cause to their very own bottom dollar, because they may not even understand what these measures would do to their employer.”
On Wednesday night, as GOP leadership adjourned the chamber because an agreement could not be reached, Senate Majority Leader Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, posted on social media that the debate is not over.
“We will set this aside for the moment but we are committed to getting it done before session ends,” she wrote. “This is a basic economic issue that we cannot let become permanently ensconced in our state. We will return to this in the next couple weeks. Stay tuned.”

Under the law, beginning May 1 employers with business receipts greater than $500,000 a year must provide at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours. The law also gradually increases the minimum wage.
The bill would allow the minimum wage to increase to $15 per hour in 2026, as voters approved, but it would not be adjusted for inflation thereafter — a policy that has been in place since 2007. The sick leave provisions would be repealed entirely.
Those provisions would make sick leave guaranteed for around 728,000 workers who currently lack it statewide, or over 1 in 3 Missouri workers, according to an analysis from the progressive nonprofit the Missouri Budget Project.
Business groups at last month’s hearing called the measure a “job killer.”
Buddy Lahl, from the Missouri Restaurant Association, called the requirements on businesses “extremely cumbersome” and said the law is a “slippery slope” for what businesses will be required to provide.
Richard Von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs with Justice, the organization that helped lead the campaign for Proposition A, said it was modeled on paid sick leave policies in 18 other states.
“It will make Missouri workers more likely to have to go to work while sick, jeopardizing their own health, the health of their coworkers and of Missouri workplaces,” he said last month, of the legislation to overturn Prop A.
Many of the same industry groups who testified at hearings to challenge the law are also challenging Proposition A in the state Supreme Court. The court has not handed down a decision yet.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)Only a handful of us who served in the legislature under the old 1889 Montana Constitution still survive. That constitution reflected the dominant power of the copper mining industry when Montana achieved statehood. It was also ridiculously verbose and prescriptive, and by the late 1960s a consensus had developed that the time had come for our 1889 Constitution to be replaced. Among the people’s major concerns was the secrecy by which laws were made within the Legislature.

It was 1971 when, at 23, I took my seat in the Montana House of Representatives – the youngest member. The House chamber was overwhelming in its grandeur.  What I didn’t know then was that what went on in that grand place was far less grand than its setting.

Legislative bodies are organized around committees.  One of my earliest experiences in a Montana Legislative committee was having the committee chair excuse all nonmembers from the committee room except two gentlemen whom I soon learned were lobbyists.  They were hired by a special interest to protect that interest’s affairs in the legislative process.  Behind those doors, closed to citizens, these selected lobbyists freely interacted with committee members as they voted on the bills before the committee.  With no experience, I simply assumed this was fine.  Certainly, as the legislature’s greenest newbie, I wasn’t going to question it.

Fortunately, a few legislators were starting openly do so.  One, was Flathead Representative James E. Murphy.  Murphy had served in the Missouri legislature before relocating to Montana after World War II.  He led the Montana House Judiciary Committee and was also Montana’s representative on the Republican National Committee.  I greatly admired Jim Murphy.

Murphy thought the 1889 Constitution was far outdated and needed to be replaced.  A prime example of what needed changing was my first experiences with the public’s lack of access to legislative decision-making and the open role of lobbyists in orchestrating law-making decisions behind closed doors.

Well, the committee procedure I witnessed in the 1971 legislative session could not happen in the Montana legislature of today, thanks to Montana’s 1972 Constitution. It requires legislative meetings as well as other government meetings to be open to the public.  No longer can lobbyists, but not the public, be allowed to meet with and impact decisions of committees behind closed doors.

Under the 1889 Constitution, legislation was routinely passed or killed by either the Montana House or Senate, with few recorded votes and no way for the folks at home to really know how their legislators had voted.  Since 1972 they always can.  It is constitutionally required.

Once in 1971, we house members were startled by a camera flash from the back balcony of the chamber.  A photographer had taken a picture of the voting board of a vote that the 1889 Constitution allowed to be non-recorded, “off the record,” even though that vote essentially determined the outcome of an important bill.  The Speaker immediately called for the Sergeant-at-Arms to apprehend the photographer’s film.  But the photographer was too fast and escaped, film intact, from the capitol building.  When the state papers carried the picture of the voting board the following day, the votes of all legislators on that bill were revealed.

Such a dramatic act to inform the people is not needed now, thanks to the 1972 Constitution, which stipulates that any vote in the House or Senate, including committees, that could result in a bill being passed or killed must be publicly recorded.

These true-life examples directly show how much more open to the people the Montana legislature is since the adoption of our 1972 Constitution.

This year, marijuana advocates are playing defense in multiple state legislatures. (Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.













Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


–  Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug





“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene, introduced a bill to prevent unauthorized immigrants from accessing publicly-funded assistance — requiring state agencies to verify immigration status for services like vaccines, prenatal and postnatal care, and food aid for children.
His bill was met with bipartisan concerns that it would hurt pregnant women, mothers and their children who don’t have proper immigration paperwork alike. That group of legislators voted to hold the bill in the committee, effectively killing the bill for the remainder of the 2024 legislative session.

However, Redman brought the bill back in 2025 — this time as House Bill 135. It passed both legislative chambers by a wide margin, and Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed it into law on April 3. It is set to take effect July 1. 
Driven by the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, Idaho lawmakers have reintroduced and advanced a wave of immigration-related bills this year. Among them is House Bill 135 — one of two bills revived in 2025 that gained enough support to pass, contributing to at least seven immigration-focused bills introduced this year.
Dr. Noreen Womack, a pediatrician at St. Luke’s, said she believes House Bill 135 will significantly impact health care for children who come to the U.S. without proper immigration paperwork. Immunization rates are already low in Idaho, and she said this bill would exacerbate that. 
“Children are completely blameless in this,” she said, noting that she serves many youth who do not have legal permission to be in the U.S. “It was not their decision to come here.”
Womack’s concerns reflect similar concerns around Idaho’s 2025 wave of immigration-related bills. In addition to House Bill 135, here is a rundown of the bills focused on regulating immigration in the Gem State, and where each bill stands after the Idaho Legislature’s 2025 session. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Idaho governor says causing fear would be ‘counterintuitive’ to purpose of House Bill 83

House Bill 83, another revived bill, was signed into law this year.
It creates new crimes called “illegal entry” and “illegal reentry.” Law enforcement would only be able to convict someone of those crimes if they are suspected for a separate crime. It also creates the crime of “trafficking a dangerous illegal alien.” The bill was signed into law by the governor on March 27, but a lawsuit from the ACLU of Idaho has temporarily blocked it from taking effect. 
In a press conference with reporters and legislative leadership on March 31, Little said the focus of the bill is to help the Trump administration deliver its immigration goals, while also focusing on targeting criminals. 
House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said the legislation is “a step in the right direction.”
ACLU of Idaho sues state for new immigration enforcement bill just signed into law

“We’re talking about individuals that are here illegally, not supposed to be here in the first place, and then they break the law,” Moyle said at the conference. “This now gives us an opportunity to work more with the feds, and it gives us an opportunity to take the worst of the worst that are in this country illegally and send them back to where they came from and keep our community safe.”
But opponents of the bill say the law would cause fear and discourage unauthorized immigrants in Idaho from reporting crimes they’ve witnessed or are experiencing.
“That would be counterintuitive to the intent if we made people fearful,” Little said in response to those concerns. “Our goal is to keep everybody here safe, and that’s what this piece of legislation is.”
Idaho State Police Lt. Colonel Fritz Zweigart reinforced the idea that the bill is focused on targeting criminals. 
“We are going to focus on the crime that’s reported, not necessarily that’s reporting the crime, unless they’re of course involved in the criminal activity,” Zweigart said at the press conference.   
Still, domestic violence advocates in Idaho say these laws will prevent immigrant victims from seeking help.
“What you’re going to see is reporting is going to go down because they don’t want to be in trouble for reporting a crime if they do not have papers,” Teena McBride, the executive director of the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Center in Idaho Falls, told the Sun. “And what you start to see is that the intensity of the violence is going to increase.”
Angelica Soto, director of client care at Voices Against Violence in Twin Falls, said she has noticed growing fear among immigrant clients seeking appointments, support groups, or services like food boxes and personal care items.
“We have to get creative in some way with the clients that don’t feel safe coming in person,” Soto told the Sun. 
 Bills introduced, but not passed in Idaho Legislature 

The following is a list of bills introduced during the session that either failed to receive a hearing or were held in committee and did not advance.
Harboring unauthorized immigrants
House Bill 335 would have made it a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on how many people are involved, to help, hide or transport unauthorized immigrants. 
Sponsor: Rep. Dale Hawkins, R-Fernwood
Status: Held in committee on March 5 
Collecting students’ immigration status
House Bill 382 would have added immigration status and nationality to the demographic data collected by Idaho public schools, ranging from K-12 schools, higher education institutions and public career technical schools. It would have required the data to be available on the state department of education’s website. 
Sponsors: Rep. Steve Tanner, R-Nampa; Rep. Dale Hawkins, R-Fernwood
Status: It did not receive a committee hearing. Sponsors pulled the bill from the agenda the day it was set to receive a hearing because it lacked support, KTVB reported.
E-Verify requirements
House Bill 252 would have required all Idaho employers to use E-Verify, a program meant to check a person’s legal work status. 
Sponsor: Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene
Status: Introduced, did not receive a hearing 
State guest worker program
House Bill 297 would have created a year-round guest worker program managed by the state. 
Sponsors: Rep. Britt Raybould, R-Rexburg; Rep. Jaron Crane, R-Nampa
Status: Introduced, did not receive a hearing
No voting for non-citizens
House Bill 94 would have required that only citizens vote in federal, state, local and public elections in Idaho. (Non-U.S. citizens are already not allowed to vote in nearly all U.S. elections, but some places outside of Idaho allow non-U.S. citizens to vote in local elections.)
Sponsors: Rep. Jaron Crane, R-Nampa
Status: Introduced, did not receive a hearing

Sarah Huckabee Sanders touts legislative wins during an April 16, 2025 press conference. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Republicans celebrated the end of the legislative session Wednesday, touting policy victories on issues such as education, maternal health, youth technology use and cutting taxes.
At an afternoon press conference, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders praised the leaders of each chamber for managing “personalities” within their conferences. The first-term Republican governor also individually named legislators who sponsored key legislative measures, such as eradicating “woke” ideology from universities in the state, adding more requirements to “end petition fraud” for constitutional amendments, and passing what she described as “the most significant economic development legislation in decades.”
“This session has reinforced that Arkansas’ conservative majority is delivering on our promises to the people of this state…for too long, our government has been enslaved to powerful special interests — not anymore,” Sanders said. “We do not work for them. We work for the people of Arkansas.”
Democratic lawmakers, at their own press conference, took the Republican supermajority to task for “out-of-control spending on misguided policies,” power grabs and the seepage of divisive national politics into Arkansas policymaking. Six members of the Senate and 19 members of the House are Democrats.
Speaker of the House Rep. Brian Evans, R-Cabot, called the session a “resounding success,” while Senate President Pro Tempore Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said the results from this year’s session showed that the state is “not always at the back of the pack.”
Sanders touted bills that aligned with many of the goals she outlined in her January State of the State address, such as cracking down on what Chinese nationals and businesses are able to do in the state.
“We will put enhanced penalties on violent criminal illegals and make sure our state is not a safe harbor for violent illegals,” Sanders said. “We will continue our record as the toughest state in America on our communist Chinese adversaries, banning them from owning land, partnering with our cities or selling merchandise to state government.”

Talking about some of that legislation, House Minority Leader Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, said national politics crept in and poisoned “what used to be a proud Arkansas tradition of independence.” 
“Cookie-cutter bills from national right-wing think tanks chipped away at the popular punching bags of today — DEI, immigrants, China and LGBT people. …In most cases these bills are mostly for show, red meat for a national audience, but they will have harmful consequences for real people in Arkansas,” Collins said.
Sanders listed a variety of other Republican victories, such as amendments to Arkansas’ Social Media Safety Act, and bills targeting Big Tech and pharmacy benefit managers, but there were some defeats. For example, a bill that would have criminalized lobbying for certain foreign entities like China, part of a broader package of China-related legislation, failed multiple times in the Senate this week and ultimately failed to make to the governor’s desk.
“Today isn’t just about one bill, it’s about the people that we serve and standing up to the powerful special interests who try to stop us,” Sanders said. “We went after Big Tech companies exploiting our kids, big drug middlemen manipulating drug prices, big government subsidizing junk food at the taxpayer’s expense, lobbyists working for adversaries like China, woke faculty trying to indoctrinate our students, and the far-left that wants to coddle dangerous criminal illegals that threaten our elections with petition fraud.”


Let us know what you think...


 

During her State of the State address, Sanders made known her desire to reform higher education this session the same way she’d done with K-12 education with the LEARNS Act in 2023.
The Arkansas ACCESS Act made significant changes to higher education, including prohibitions on excused absences for political protests and the collection and reporting of DEI-related information for institutional accreditation purposes. The legislation also permits faculty performance reviews to result in the removal of tenure status and will allow for the incorporation of a return-on-investment metric in the higher education funding model, among other things. 
Republicans also pushed through a bill that banned students from using cellphones in schools — another Sanders priority — and amended the Educational Freedom Account Program to limit how much money participants could spend on things like extracurricular activities and travel expenses.
Sanders and Republicans lawmakers made the ballot petition process a priority during the session, passing multiple bills that opponents say are a direct assault on the people’s right to direct democracy.
Collins called the bills affecting the petition process “the most egregious power grab of the session” and a “full-on assault on direct democracy.” 
“Republicans have made it nearly impossible to exercise your right to petition to get something on the ballot,” he said. “We will soon regret snatching away the people’s right to petition.”

The Little Rock Democrat said power grabs were one of the most consistent themes of the session, “usually coming at the expense of the people of Arkansas.”
“ACCESS eliminated, shrank and kicked community stakeholders off boards, centralizing power in the governor,” Collins said.
“One legislator tried to force Arkansas PBS and the State Library to comply with his demands. When the State Library Board didn’t agree, the Legislature fired the entire board,” he said. “Countless bills were introduced to micromanage cities, counties, state agencies and school boards, as the emboldened Republican supermajority apparently decided it wasn’t enough to do their jobs, they needed to do everybody else’s job too.”
Free school breakfast, maternal health Medicaid, school cellphone ban all become Arkansas law

Republicans and Democrats also achieved wins working across the aisle, passing legislation to  to improve maternal health and make breakfast free for all students.
“In a bipartisan compromise effort, we, alongside Sen. [Jonathan] Dismang and Sen. Clarke Tucker, made Arkansas the first state in the South to offer free school breakfast to every single one of our students,” Sanders said.
At their press conference, Democratic leaders also highlighted the bipartisan effort on free school breakfasts now Act 123.
Evans said that Arkansans should be proud of the legislators they sent to Little Rock, praising members of his conference for “putting politics aside” and contributing to a successful session.
 Democrats remain defiant

Senate Minority Leader Greg Leding of Fayetteville said that despite the long odds against Democrats in both legislative chambers, they were still able to “score some meaningful wins,” both in terms of legislation they were able to stop and legislation they passed. 
He singled out freshman Sen. Jamie Scott of North Little Rock, whom he called “one of the most thoughtful, compassionate leaders” in the Legislature, and first-term Rep. Jessie McGruder of Marion for their work on maternal health issues and early voting.
Leding highlighted the united work of all legislative Democrats in helping Republican opponents derail a $750 million appropriation bill intended for a new 3,000-bed prison in rural western Arkansas.
“Regardless of what you think of the need for a prison, it’s clear that that plan for Franklin County is wrong,” Leding said.
Collins cited the prison as part of the budget-busting theme of the session.
“The message was clear from the very beginning of session, Republicans were going to bust the budget on no-limit private school vouchers and a misguided billion dollar-plus prison in Franklin County, and there wouldn’t be much left for anything else. And that’s exactly what happened,” he said. “While Democrats and others rejected prison spending for now, that bill is coming due.”
Going forward, Collins said Democrats will continue to push for the issues they made a priority at the beginning of the session in January: education; health care, especially maternal and mental health; and democracy.
 Vetos

After both press conferences were finished, Sanders’ office announced she had vetoed two items: a bill that legalized the delivery of marijuana or the purchase of it from a drive-thru, along with a line-item veto eliminating the salary for the director of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock’s Institute on Race and Ethnicity.
“This session I championed Arkansas ACCESS, my plan to make college more accessible for all and get indoctrination out of college classrooms,” Sanders wrote in her veto letter to Hester and Evans. “Arkansas will not waste nearly $200,000 in taxpayer dollars on DEI administrators who promote woke nonsense.”
However, it is not clear if the institute is still functioning. A search of UALR’s website turned up results for strategic plans that referenced the institute last year, before ACCESS was passed, but when clicked on the webpages appeared to have been taken down or moved. A search of UALR’s directory did not appear to return results for anyone directly employed by the institute.
When asked for comment, a UALR spokesperson said the position was vacant and the university had not planned to fill it.
Sanders said she vetoed House Bill 1889 because it would have “expand[ed] access to usable marijuana.”

All now move to Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.,"Rep. Garrett Bascom (center) chats with colleagues in the House chamber on April 9, 2025. His immigration enforcement effort is the only surviving bill on that topic. (Courtesy Indiana House Republicans)Indiana lawmakers are giving law enforcement explicit instructions on how to “cooperate” with federal immigration enforcement efforts under legislation that passed the House 58-19 Wednesday. It is one of dozens of bills that got final concurrence votes in the House and Senate, including curtailing the state’s controversial economic development agency, chiding health insurers and more.
All now move to Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.
Rep. Garrett Bascom, R-Lawrenceburg, said Indiana law on local collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) takes a passive approach.
His House Bill 1393 would require jails and detention facilities to tell county sheriffs when they have probable cause to believe that someone they’re booking on unrelated misdemeanor or felony charges isn’t legally in the country. Sheriffs would have to report that information to ICE.
“This is being done in most of our counties,” Bascom said. “This defines the action we want to see.”
The Senate softened the language — including by taking the onus off officers on the street and placing it more firmly on sheriffs — but opponents still believe it will lead to racial profiling.
Rep. Mike Andrade, D-Munster, noted that counties already have policies on this, whether it be a fax to ICE or a direct call.
“They’re already doing the work,” he said. “This is a do-nothing bill.”
Senate Republicans blocked another immigration bill that also could have cracked down on employers for using illegal workers.
Economic development scrutiny measure finalized
Legislation taking aim at the Indiana Economic Development Corp. (IEDC) easily earned a ticket to Braun’s desk on a unanimous, 41-0 concurrence vote in the Indiana Senate. Lawmakers there concurred with several changes made in the House.
Senate Bill 516 establishes an office for entrepreneurship and innovation, a Braun agenda item. The new office would assume oversight of certified technology parks, currently an IEDC duty.
  Sen. Brian Buchanan, R-Lebanon, chats with a colleague in the Senate chamber on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
IEDC has faced years worth of backlash from lawmakers and constituents alike over its secretive approach to economic development efforts like the Limitless Exploration/Advanced Pace (LEAP) Innovation District.
“Over the last few years, obviously there’s been a lot of questions, a lot of concerns over IEDC,” author Sen. Brian Buchanan told the Capital Chronicle. “We’re just trying to find a way to make sure the transparency and accountability is there that people expect, but still also they have the ability to do their job and do it very successfully.”
The bill tasks the IEDC and the executives of communities that host innovation development districts — like one within LEAP — with annually compiling reports about the districts’ activities over the last calendar year. A detailed list of information must be included.
Buchanan, R-Lebanon, said some residents either “absolutely do not like” LEAP or “tremendously embrace it.” But most, he added, “just have questions. They want to know what’s going on. How’s it going to impact them? What’s it going to mean? And that’s where I think the additional transparency and accountability will help.”
The legislation would also require the quasi-public agency to tell local units of government about acquisitions of more than 100 acres — whether it’s bought in one or multiple transactions — at least 30 days before those purchases close.
LEAP spending nears $1B with projected budget shielded, investigation finds

The State Budget Committee must get a copy of that notice. And IEDC would have to extend any invitations to tour potential sites to the entire committee, not just GOP leadership.
Additionally, Senate Bill 516 would split the IEDC president role off from the cabinet-level commerce secretary role. Under current law, they’re held by the same person.
Braun’s already been willing to curtail the agency.
Last week, he ordered Indiana Economic Development Foundation and other state-affiliated nonprofits to file disclosures with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the State Budget Committee, retroactive to 10 years and moving forward.
 Put up your dukes!
The House easily gave final approval to a bill requiring the Indiana Gaming Commission to regulate bare-knuckle fighting and more. House Bill 1073 also includes mixed martial arts, martial arts, professional wrestling, boxing and sparring.
Rep. Craig Haggard, R-Mooresville, said unsanctioned events have been occurring around Indiana, and that it’s a safety concern.
It passed the House 83-2. The two members who voted against the legislation were Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, and Rep. Heath VanNatter, R-Kokomo.
Health coverage, other measures also cross finish line
Also in the Senate, weakened limits on prior authorization are just steps away from law after an attempt last year died. Senate Bill 480 received a 39-2 concurrence vote.
“I know that we’ve got a ways to go … but I think that this is a very important start,” said Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis.
She thanked author Sen. Tyler Johnson, R-Leo, for his work on the health insurer cost-control technique.
  Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, speaks in committee on April 10, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“This is going to be an important step in lowering health care costs for Hoosiers and making sure that we just protect our health care benefits,” Hunley added.
And renters might soon find it easier to get certain evictions sealed from their records after beneficial legislation advanced on a 35-1 tally.
Author Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, said that Hoosier tenants can’t always get evictions expunged, even when they’ve paid what they owe or otherwise resolved the dispute. She said Senate Bill 142 allows that renter to “have that black mark, if you will, on their record removed.”
Brown acknowledged that it doesn’t “fulfill all the needs” that tenant advocates sought, and that she’d continue to work on the topic in the future, “but I think we’re in a really good spot right now.”
Also exiting the legislative process after favorable concurrence votes were Senate measures setting out “standard operating procedures” for eyewitness identification and modestly extending the statute of limitations for Level 3 felony rape prosecution.
Under Indiana law, the legislative session must end by the end of the month.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Ever since I was a child, Oklahoma schools have struggled in terms of teaching history and civics.
Even when I was too young to understand what Joseph McCarthy’s “Red Scare” was, I could sense that educators remained intimidated by what I learned was rightwing propaganda. And when I became a teacher at John Marshall High School in the early 1990s, school systems were pressured to use Texas-approved textbooks that were designed to comply with the teach-to-the-test mindset fostered by the Reagan administration’s “A Nation at Risk” campaign.
After the House Bill 1017, known as the Education Reform Act of 1990, however, our teachers saw incremental improvements in teaching and learning – even in government classes. But, the Bush administration’s No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and the Obama administration’s Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 especially undercut civics instruction.
As districts were forced to focus on math and reading test scores, social studies was largely ignored.
Although I was actively involved in resisting data-driven, competition-driven reforms, I must admit that I was too diplomatic when defending civics. I silently worried that our abandonment of social studies could be the most destructive result of corporate school reforms. But I was reluctant to criticize colleagues who gave up on the fight, and I didn’t say aloud that our failure to teach government and history could help undermine American democracy.
Today, however, our democracy is clearly in danger. At a time, for instance, when a president claims that he can seek a third term and seems to think he can ignore federal courts, a solid understanding of the Constitution is necessary.
Moreover, today’s students are anxious and feel disengaged and powerless in a world challenged by rapid changes in the climate, demography and technology.
Fortunately, Lindsey Cormack’s “How to Raise a Citizen (And Why It’s Up to You to Do It)” gives me hope. She offers practical – and bipartisan – approaches for discussing political issues and governmental processes that are very similar to what worked in John Marshall classrooms.
And guess what? Cormack doesn’t dump the entire challenge on schools and educators.  Cormack builds on the traditions of parents taking on the role of discussing government and politics at the dinner table and encouraging their children to get involved in community and local government activities.
The book reminds me about the ways my high school students, their communities and I taught each other how to actively participate in our democracy. Our academics shifted focus during presidential or mid-term elections, or when state or local politics dominated the headlines, or even when extreme events, like the Oklahoma City bombing, 9/11, or wars in Iraq and Afghanistan occurred.
When English classes started reading Ralph Ellison’s “The Invisible Man,” I would teach about his experiences growing up in Oklahoma City. The students were especially insightful when guest lecturers visited, and during field trips to places like art museums, the “Deep Deuce,” where Ellison grew up, and the state Capitol. This was especially true when a veteran of the Sit-In movement joined us in repeated trips to the Capitol. Legislators were always enthralled by the students’ wisdom.
Above all, student saw high-level instruction as a sign of respect, and responded by learning in a holistic and meaningful way.
But in recent years, I’ve seen a shift in how we teach because of corporate school reformers teach-to-the-test mandates.
It was only a few years ago, I was so hopeful that schools, families and communities would come together so we could nurture a commitment to civics education and our 21st century democracy.
Now, I worry that our failures to teach civics and history have helped undermine our society’s commitment to political institutions.
I fear lawmakers will be unable to gather the courage to stand up to rightwing attacks on schools by state Superintendent Ryan Walters and his supporters that aim to mandate history standards such as “identifying discrepancies in the 2020 election,” the “halting of ballot-counting in select cities,” “the security risks of mail-in balloting” and “the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”
I’m also concerned that our leaders won’t have the gumption to push back against the Trump administration’s focus on defunding promising education and nonprofit programs.
Because it will take a village and diverse strategies to build on our communities’ strengths and to raise and educate our children.

The event is part of the national advocacy campaign called Quilting for the Constitution: Peace by Piece, the coalition announced in a news release. It involves people writing messages on fabric squares that call for commitment to constitutional principles, respect for the rule of law, and protecting checks and balances. 
In May, quilts sewn with the fabric squares will be delivered to Washington, D.C., congressional offices.
“Each square represents a voice, a value, and a vision for the future of our country,” Alexis Bradley, a campaign organizer, said in a prepared statement. “Peace by Piece gives women a way to engage in the political process that is creative, nonviolent, and deeply personal.”
In March, the campaign launched at a national conference in Orem, Utah, according to the news release. 
When: Noon on Saturday, April 19
Where: Cecil D. Andrus Park, located at 601 W. Jefferson St. in Boise

“Child care is not a luxury, it’s not a nice-to-have,” said Claire Lindstrom, an Eau Claire parent who addressed the rally. “It is infrastructure.”
“We’re here today because the people who are doing this very important work can no longer afford to hold up a broken system,” said Toshiba Adams, an instructor and instructional chair in early childhood education at Milwaukee Area Technical College.

The rally and afternoon visit with legislators followed a morning gathering of the participants at the nearby Concourse Hotel that included talks by lawmakers, parents and providers. At noon 350 or more people — the largest action by child care advocates in recent memory — marched from the hotel to the rally, with chants of “Kids first, families first, invest in child care now.”
The crowd massed on the Capitol building’s west steps for a half hour of speeches.
Lindstrom broke down the average cost for child care. A single parent paid the minimum wage, $7.25 an hour, “would have to work 43 full-time weeks just to cover one year of infant care,” she said. A family making the median income in Wisconsin — about $75,000 a year — will probably spend 20% of their earnings on care for a single child.
“If they have two kids, an infant and a 4-year-old, they’re spending over a third of their income just to go to work,” Lindstrom said. “This is not a personal budgeting issue. That’s a broken system.”
Gov. Tony Evers has proposed $480 million in the state’s 2025-27 budget that would go to licensed child care providers, replenishing the state’s Child Care Counts program funded from federal pandemic relief. Without that, Child Care Counts will expire for good in June.
At its height between 2021 and 2023, Child Care Counts was credited with stabilizing Wisconsin’s providers, who shared in payments totaling $20 million a month. Providers reported that with the money they were able to raise wages for child care workers while holding down increases in the fees that parents paid.
“Our early childhood educators are trained in how to support brain development, emotional regulation, and school readiness,” Lindstrom said. “We expect them to do this important work and yet we pay them less than workers at Kwik Trip and Culver’s.”
Evers, a Democrat, was unable to persuade the Legislature’s Republican majority to extend the program in the state’s 2023-25 budget. He repurposed other federal funds, and the total payment was reduced to $10 million a month. That will run out in June.
Providers, advocates and early childhood education experts have argued that only with an ongoing investment like Child Care Counts can providers pay child care workers adequately without pricing care out of reach for the average family.
“We need child care for our communities to function,” Lindstrom said. “We can no longer afford to treat this like a personal problem. It’s a public domain. And the solution is clear. We need to fund child care.”
A survey report released April 10 found that up to 25% of Wisconsin providers said they might close without continued support along the lines of Child Care Counts. More than one-third said they might have to reduce the number of children then could serve for lack of staff.
Large majorities said they might have to cut pay and that they expect to have more difficulty recruiting workers. More than half said they expect some employees to quit and that providing high quality care would become more difficult.

“We will see dramatically less care available in virtually every single county in the state,” Ruth Schmidt, executive director of the Wisconsin Early Childhood Association, told the crowd. “Is that acceptable?”
“No!” the crowd roared back in reply.
“Is it acceptable that moms will have to consider leaving the workforce in record numbers because you cannot work if you cannot afford or find child care? Is it acceptable that stressed out parents doing the best they can will have no support from the state to ensure that they can work and contribute to our tax base?”
With each question the rallygoers responded with resounding shouts of “No!”
Sachin Shivaram, CEO of Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry in Manitowoc, told the crowd that businesses should support state funding for child care.
His company pays employees with young children $400 a month toward their child care costs, he said. When the crowd applauded, he thanked them, then added, “but I also feel very embarrassed. … That’s so little, and the cost of child care is, you know, several thousand dollars a month, and this is just barely scratching the surface.”
Shivaram pointed out the state manufacturing tax credit that his company receives, along with all Wisconsin manufacturers.

“And guess what? We have to do absolutely nothing to get that tax credit,” he said. “We don’t have to invest in any capital equipment, we don’t have to train any workers, we don’t have to give back to the community, nothing. You know, how about we make that tax credit contingent on helping the child care situation?”
In an interview after the legislative visits Schmidt of WECA said the hundreds who took part went to almost every state Senate office and about 90% of the Assembly members’ offices as well. WECA organized the event along with Wisconsin Head Start Association and Raising Wisconsin — an advocacy campaign that WECA and allied groups launched in 2022.
“We really wanted this to be nonpartisan,” Schmidt said — “just an opportunity to tell stories and share, from a real perspective, from the heart what’s going on with this industry.”
Some of those conversations — with leaders in the Legislature who advocates have already spoken to about the budget request — were “not necessarily a surprise,” she acknowledged.  
With other lawmakers, she added, including some of the 30 first-term Assembly members elected in November as well as others who have not served on committees where child care has been an agenda item, “there was a lot of interest in just learning,”
The visits were an opportunity for personal testimony to reach lawmakers and their staff, Schmidt said. “The power of having parents tell their stories, and the power of having educators tell their stories about how they’ve been using the public funding when it’s available — it was very compelling.”

With an asking price of $50 million, the 55,136 acres could rake in the biggest sum ever for a Nebraska ranch.
Located in the nation’s No. 1 cow county — and including nine miles of the Snake River, eight miles of Gordon Creek, 26 solar wells, 79 windmills, 20-plus artesian flowing wells and an airplane hangar — the property has grabbed the attention of potential buyers from numerous states.
But not all are happy with the idea of the sale.
 Not all want to sell 

Some members of the Abbott family, which bought the property from the Metzgers over a half-century ago, object to letting go of the ranch where whitetail and mule deer run, walleye and trout fishing is common, and the Ogallala Aquifer nourishes grassy meadows for acres.
Chris, who has been the ranch’s main steward, wants to hold onto the operation, but the majority of the five brothers and sisters who are major shareholders have voted to sell and focus on other areas of their lives.
It’s an emotional struggle that, without discussing specifics of the ranch, Nebraska State Sen. Tanya Storer said many Sandhills natives can relate to.

“Being part of a multigenerational ranch family myself, sometimes even selling a specific pasture can be emotional,” said Storer, who lives in Cherry County.
She says the ranch is a cornerstone of the north-central Nebraska region, with the Abbott family legacy entrenched not only in the cattle but banking industries. While new owners are always welcome, Storer said, the bond is “really never the same” as with families that have grown up together, branded together and have run to each other’s aid when fires or other ranch tragedies hit.
“It’s the interwovenness of the experience, the culture of what we do,” said the lawmaker from Whitman.
Mike Abbott, who at age 67 is the youngest of the siblings and among those ready to sell, said he wouldn’t change any of his ranch experiences, including 4-H and riding horseback to a one-room schoolhouse. 
He recalls his mom and dad, Art and Patricia, buying the ranch from Woodrow Metzger in 1969. Mike was about 10 years old then, though generations of the Abbotts have lived in the area since the turn of the 20th Century.
“Yep, that was my childhood,” said Mike, president of the corporation that owns the property. “Then, ranching provided well for my family. But it was different for my three kids.”

He called ranching “a changing industry,” and said his own three children have ventured into other work. The sale of the ranch should allow Abbott family members to support younger generations in their endeavors, he said.
 ‘Mama cow’ country 

Marketing the ranch for sale is Hall and Hall, a brokerage firm based in the county seat of Valentine. 
Agent Mark Johnson said torn feelings are commonplace in his business and can be magnified with multigenerational ranch land. He also worked on the recent sale of the Dumbbell Ranch, which was mostly situated in Cherry County and attracted national attention for its quirky name, rich history and size of 15,500 acres.
In that case, the two siblings who controlled the Dumbbell, despite sentimental attachment, agreed on selling. One sibling was immersed in a computer career in Colorado, and his sister was about to get married again. 
Her daughters had more pressing interests than to oversee the operation and, as Anne Anderson Bennet said at the time: “We love the Sandhills. Our family loves ranching. It’s time to move on.”
Even larger, the Metzger Ranch, also known as the Abbott Ranch, is a “rock” in the county known for having the most cows in the United States, Johnson said, calling Cherry County the best place for a “mama cow.”
Agriculture is the No. 1 industry in Nebraska, and cattle production represents the largest segment of the industry, according to the Nebraska Beef Council.

“Just the sheer size of it is extremely notable,” Johnson said of the Abbott property. His team, whose expertise is in ranches, believes the asking price surpasses all other Nebraska ranches to date. 
Since hitting the market earlier this month, Johnson said, he’s fielded interest from people in Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Wyoming and Montana. He said they include land investors and ranchers, some attracted to the subirrigated land where drought is not as common and others who feel pushed out of their current regions by non-agricultural development.
He suspects potential buyers will see an opportunity to invest in a “hard asset” versus the stock market.
The cows aren’t included in the price tag, but the real estate listing shows the ranch as a 2,500-head cow/calf year-round operation. Included in the sale are five homes, a bunkhouse. There’s a horse barn, cattle working facilities and other outbuildings.
“Rarely do ranches of such large acreage and quality come to market,” says the Hall and Hall web site. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for anyone who dreams of a future in land ownership and cattle production.”

After News Channel Nebraska reported the real estate listing, the family sent a statement from the children of Chris Abbott, who described their dad as the decades-long main steward of the ranch.
A.J. and Carver Abbott and Alicia Abbott Clark said in the statement that their dad, who they said grew the cow herd and land mass, would never vote to sell the ranch. They said his four siblings did vote to sell, and one has since “retracted.”
“The cattle, hills, meadows, trees, river ground, summer pastures, windmills, fence lines, etc., run deep in our Dad’s soul. As a working rancher since he was a child, Chris has developed pride, respect and callouses,” they wrote. 
The three said many have reached out to them, and they wanted people to know that all was done to try and convince the “on-paper majority owners” not to sell.
Their hope, they said, is that “someone with a whole hell of a lot of money and vision will hear about what is going on and will partner in the ranch, or that Dad’s siblings will accept our lease offer.”

Mike Abbott said he and wife Pam want the next owner to “value and appreciate all the natural resources the land can offer and be exceptional stewards to it.”
“My favorite memories were working alongside my dad all those years, no matter the task,” the youngest sibling said. His dad, Art, passed away in 1986 and mom, Patricia (Frank), died in 2009.
 Hard decision 

Storer said her heart hurts for any family that, for whatever reason, closes a ranching chapter.

“There is something unique about the Sandhills. It becomes part of you,” she said.  “If and when you have to separate from that, it certainly leaves an empty spot in your soul.”
Mike Abbott expects some of the Abbott family to remain in the area after a sale. His sisters and major shareholders are Andrea Berger, Diane Shadbolt and Helen Feller. Grandchildren have expanded the number of stakeholders in the ranch.
He didn’t want to discuss or add to any conflict, but he said a sale would get more complicated over time, and now seemed the best way for most involved. 
“This was a very very hard decision,” said Mike Abbott.  “We’ve got to move forward.”

Two days after the House passed a separate measure to require primary elections, Republicans and Democrats challenged the addition of $8 million on the House floor to reimburse county election commissions for holding primaries. 
The push for primaries stems from political division in Williamson and Maury counties where far-right groups want to hold caucuses rather than primaries to determine Republican nominees for local elections. Caucuses are gatherings of political party members to select nominees for elections, as opposed to primaries in which voters go to the polls.
The bill requiring primaries was presented as having no impact on the state budget, critics said. 
Yet Republican Rep. Ryan Williams of Cookeville introduced the budget amendment Wednesday on the House floor, drawing immediate opposition from Republicans and Democrats before it passed 57-30.

Democratic Rep. Jason Powell of Nashville blamed Republican lawmakers for trying to inject the money late in the budget process to impact elections.
“This is a drastic change to the way we have conducted elections for a very long time in our state,” Powell said.
Republican Rep. Todd Warner of Chapel Hill in Maury County, where Republicans have held caucuses, was more adamant, saying he and other lawmakers were told the cost of the primary requirement bill was not significant.
“We were lied to in committee. We were lied to about this bill,” Warner said. He later added that the Senate’s budget discussions showed the money was added to pay for the primary bill.
Williams responded by saying the measure was “simply an appropriation” to local governments to pay for primaries. House Speaker Cameron Sexton backed him up, saying the money was needed to reimburse counties that have held primary elections already.
The Republican-controlled House defeated several attempts by Democrats to amend the budget to add items such as a grocery sales tax cut and shift expenses such as $120 million for private-school vouchers, $113 million for charter school administration and $4.5 million for 10 positions within the Attorney General’s Office to a fund to fix potholes on state highways. Another amendment would have moved more than $5 million for the state’s new immigration “czar” to cut waste and fraud.
Crunching the numbers
Of the $59.7 billion budget, which takes effect July 1, about $30 million comes from state revenue and nearly $20 billion from the federal government.
Lawmakers took $179 million from the governor’s supplemental budget and put it toward 181 requests for legislation or spending in their districts.
The legislature also created a $42.5 million grant pool for volunteer fire departments, rescue squads, emergency medical services, senior centers, courthouses and museums and Second Harvest Food Bank, which suffered federal funding cuts
Republicans lauded the budgetary work, but Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons of Nashville said the past two GOP governors, including Gov. Bill Lee, have been living “high on the hog,” doubling Tennessee’s budget without improving people’s lives while giving tax breaks to out-of-state companies through the franchise and excise break. He predicted the state would hit a “fiscal crisis” in the next five years, in part because of a private-school voucher “scam.”
“This governor’s the single worst governor in the state of Tennessee’s history,” Clemmons said to a mix of cheers and jeers.
Clemmons also said a line can be drawn from Lee to his donors and state contracts, though he did not give details.
Republican leaders responded by saying Tennessee has the lowest debt per capita in the nation, in addition to a low tax burden. 
Williams, chairman of the House finance subcommittee, countered, saying lawmakers had to cut more than $1 billion worth of state spending 15 years ago because the state was poorly managed by Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen.
House finance Chairman Gary Hicks said the state has spent recurring revenue on non-recurring items, those that are to be funded for only one year, enabling it to maintain a “significant balance” at the start of each year. 
  “This governor’s the single worst governor in the state of Tennessee’s history,” said House Democratic Caucus Chair John Ray Clemmons of Nashville on Wednesday. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Tax growth is slowing in the state’s general fund, zero growth this year and only 2% next year, which will generate $376 million, according to Hicks.
State Departments reverted $1.5 billion in unspent funds in fiscal 2024, leaving them to be spent on next year’s budget, he said.
The next budget also includes $700 million in interest earnings on federal funds the state received for COVID pandemic relief.
Major expenditures include $597 million for disaster relief, $640 million in new funding for K-12 education, including $198 million for one-time teacher bonuses connected to the private-school voucher vote early this year. 
Higher education is netting $264 million more for universities, higher pay and benefits and capital improvements.
New spending of $1.5 billion for health and social services is part of the budget, as well, including TennCare shared savings between the state and federal government. It involves $78 million for rural hospitals, uncompensated care and $4 million for county health department projects.
The legislature is borrowing $1 billion to go toward road projects, a departure from state policy to pay for infrastructure with gas taxes.

(Phil McKenna/Inside Climate News)CAMERON — For a ship the length of nearly three football fields, Energy Intelligence seemed to turn on a dime. With tugboats pushing and pulling at its bow and stern, the 295-meter liquefied natural gas tanker pivoted 180 degrees in the brackish waters of the Calcasieu Ship Channel in late February, preparing to refuel for a trip to the Netherlands.
Its journey is part of a seismic shift that in the past decade has seen the U.S. go from an LNG importer to the world’s largest exporter, fueled by an ongoing boom in hydraulically fractured natural gas. New U.S. export terminals and expansions currently under construction will nearly double existing export capacity in the coming years, while even more projects have been approved.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Scientists have warned that LNG production involves significant greenhouse gas emissions at every step in the process, from methane leaks at wells to the burning of the gas by end users. But there’s been little attention to the impact of emissions from the tankers that ship LNG from the U.S. to other countries.
That too is substantial, an Inside Climate News analysis found. A single year of greenhouse gas emissions from tankers carrying LNG from the United States more than cancels out the annual emissions reductions achieved through all the electric vehicles currently on U.S. roads.
To estimate the climate pollution from vessels exporting U.S. LNG, Inside Climate News analyzed federal export data, information from the International Gas Union on the ships’ capacities and propulsion systems and ship tracking data supplied by the maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic.
The first-of-its-kind analysis totaled emissions for two one-year periods: between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018, shortly after large-scale exports from the U.S. began with the opening of the Sabine Pass export facility in Louisiana, and again between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024.
The perilous links between Ukraine’s energy future and Louisiana

Inside Climate News found that total greenhouse gas emissions more than quadrupled from about 4.1 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent for 224 return journeys in 2017-2018 to around 18.4 million tons for 1,265 journeys in 2023-2024. To put the latter figure in perspective: It equals the annual greenhouse gas reductions from swapping 5.8 million gasoline-powered vehicles with an equal number of electric vehicles.
That’s around 50% more than all the light-duty EVs currently registered in the United States.
It’s “a big deal,” said Mark Brownstein, the Environmental Defense Fund’s energy transition senior vice president.
“Methane from human activities drives nearly a third of the warming that the planet is experiencing right now,” he said. “Every molecule of methane, whether lost at the well site, the pipeline, the ship or the power plant is working to accelerate warming at a time when the climate crisis is bearing down on countries around the world.”
The Inside Climate News analysis drew on methods described in a scientific study published in 2023, which accounted for the age of each ship, its specific propulsion system, the distance the tanker traveled, the capacity of its LNG tanks and the time each ship spent maneuvering and docked.
Importantly, these calculations accounted for both the release of CO2 from vessels’ engines and emissions of unburned methane that passes through the engines of tankers that are fueled by gas boiling off from their cargo tanks. Across the entire fleet involved in U.S. exports of LNG, this “methane slip” accounted for more than half of all CO2-equivalent emissions.
Methane, the primary component of LNG, is the second leading driver of climate change after carbon dioxide. On a pound for pound basis, it’s far more effective than CO2 at warming the planet in the 20 years after it’s released. And because methane remains in the atmosphere for a relatively short amount of time compared to carbon dioxide, reducing methane emissions is widely viewed as the fastest way to combat climate change.
The portion of emissions from shipping is modest relative to the total climate pollution associated with LNG. A recent peer-reviewed study suggests that shipping accounts for 6 percent of LNG-associated greenhouse gas emissions, with the vast majority coming from production wells and end use, when gas is burned for heating or to produce electricity.
The study concluded that the total climate pollution associated with exported U.S. LNG is higher than that of coal produced in the importing countries. Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, a group that supports the natural gas industry, funded a July 2024 report that did not go through academic peer review and came to the opposite conclusion.
Putting the ICN finding in the context of vehicle use makes it all the more striking, said Ade Samuel, an energy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
“When you compare it to these numbers of the emissions released from gasoline-powered vehicles, I think it really gives you a sense for how significant the emissions of LNG on the full lifecycle basis are,” Samuel said.
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry, and Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future both declined to comment on the ICN analysis.

Out of sight, out of mind
While much has been made of methane releases at wells, pipelines and compressor stations in recent years, emissions of methane and CO2 from ships transporting LNG have gone largely unnoticed. Part of the reason is the physical distance of tankers at sea from human observers.
A gap in satellite capabilities is also partly to blame. Satellites can easily detect plumes of methane from oil and gas facilities on land, but the technique, which relies on bouncing light off the ground, has proved more challenging over water.
In addition, tankers passing through international waters occupy an accountability “no man’s land” when it comes to quantifying both the release of methane and CO2 from ships, said Alison Kirsch, a senior energy analyst for the Sierra Club.
“Shipping emissions are not really taken into account by either the exporting country or the importing country,” Kirsch said. “The shipping phase of emissions sort of falls to the wayside.”
The Inside Climate News analysis also revealed a secondary reason for the increased emissions in 2023-2024, beyond the rapid ramp-up in exports: Tankers are making longer journeys to countries in Asia and the west coast of South America, due to companies increasingly routing LNG vessels around the southern tip of South America or South Africa rather than passing through the Panama Canal. Drought–induced low water levels in the canal limited ship traffic through the waterway starting in early 2023.
One vessel bound for Singapore, meanwhile, turned around in the Mediterranean and headed around the tip of South Africa rather than passing through the Suez Canal in November 2023, shortly after Houthi rebels in Yemen began to attack international shipping in the Red Sea. GasLog Partners, the owner of the vessel, did not respond to requests for comment.

Journeys to Taiwan, China and Japan were 13 to 16 percent longer in 2023-2024 than in 2017-2018, while trips to Chile were 31 percent longer. Still, these disruptions to shipping added roughly half a million metric tons to estimated emissions, dwarfed by the vast growth in climate pollution caused by the five-fold explosion in the number of export journeys.
While already poised to continue growing, U.S. LNG exports and their associated emissions may soon expand even further. President Donald Trump pledged to fast-track the approval of additional LNG export capacity and is already making good on his word.
Since he took office, his administration has announced approvals for four large LNG projects, including Calcasieu Pass 2 and Commonwealth LNG, both adjacent to the existing terminal on the Calcasieu Ship Channel, just inland from the Gulf of Mexico.
It’s not clear whether there’s enough demand for the additional LNG export capacity. Tariffs levied by the Trump administration have already resulted in a pause on U.S. LNG imports by China, the world’s largest buyer of the fuel. However, other countries, including Japan, India, Taiwan and Ukraine have pledged to increase imports of U.S. LNG.
Whatever happens, “we need to take a look at this from the point of view of reducing methane emissions and doing whatever we can to make that happen,” said Kirsten Sinclair Rosselot, a chemical engineer and environmental performance analyst who runs the consultancy Process Profiles and was the lead author of the 2023 study that assessed greenhouse gas emissions from individual LNG tankers. “But the end goal is to transition off of fossil fuels, which would eliminate the need for shipping LNG in the first place.”
How methane escapes when LNG is shipped
LNG is natural gas that has been super-cooled to minus-260 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature so cold the fuel changes from a gas to a liquid. Liquifying the gas shrinks its volume, allowing LNG tankers to carry approximately 600 times more fuel within their holds than if the fuel remained a gas.
Ships like the Energy Intelligence have thick insulating walls to help keep the LNG cool. However, even with insulation, a portion of the fuel boils off, turning back into a gas. While some boil-off gas may escape the ship as “fugitive emissions” released into the atmosphere, most of the gas is captured and routed to the ship’s engines to power the vessel.
For a ship’s primary engines, which propel it forward, the amount of unburned methane is low, approximately 2 percent of the total gas that passes through the engine. However, for the auxiliary engines that generate electricity for lighting and other electrical needs on the ship, methane slip can be much higher. This is because auxiliary engines are typically run at low capacity, or “load,” a state at which they do not operate efficiently.
“Where you really see the slip onboard is in the generators,” Rosselot said. “They run the generators at low load, and methane slip is horrific at low load.”
More than 15% of the gas that enters an auxiliary engine can pass through the generator unburned when the engines are run at low loads, according to a study published in 2022. The finding was recently confirmed by the Methane Abatement in Maritime Innovation Initiative (MAMII), an industry group whose members include oil giants Chevron, Shell and TotalEnergies, plus several of the largest LNG shipping companies, including MOL, Maran Gas, Seapeak and Knutsen OAS.
Greenhouse gases from proposed Venture Global site concern Calcasieu neighbors

“Despite recent progress, methane slip is the key component of onboard emissions,” MAMII stated in a report published in July. The report noted that methane releases “constitute a major risk” for the industry but added that existing technology “can reduce methane slip to a negligible, if not zero, amount.”
“This is solvable,” said Panos Mitrou, MAMII chairman and global gas segment director for Lloyd’s Register, which provides technical advice for the shipping industry. “I think it’s possible to come to a stage where LNG fuel ships, or energy carrying ships, will be what we call ‘methane proof.’ They will have minimal, negligible methane emissions.”
One method to reduce the rate of methane slip suggested in the report is to simply run fewer generators at higher loads. Ship operators typically run multiple generators as a built-in backup to ensure a steady power supply in case one of the generators fails.
The industry report suggested batteries could replace redundant generators as a backup source of power. Another suggested solution was “shaft generators,” devices that harness the rotational motion of the main engine to generate electricity.
To hasten emissions reductions, MAMII went a step further, calling for industry-wide regulations. “It is vital that regulators implement a clear, robust, and focused regulatory framework as soon as possible to incentivise technology development and uptake,” the report stated.
Since January 2024, the European Union has required LNG vessels and other large ships entering EU ports to monitor and report their climate pollution, including methane. Shipping companies will have to pay for excessive methane emissions starting in 2026.
More efforts to reduce that pollution are underway. The United Nations’ International Maritime Organization approved draft regulations April 11 that would put a price on greenhouse gas emissions for the global shipping industry.
However, the global framework is less stringent than the European rules and will not meet the UN agency’s target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping 30 percent by 2030, said Bryan Comer, the marine program director for the International Council on Clean Transportation.
“We made some progress on decarbonizing maritime shipping, but ultimately, what was agreed this week falls short of IMO’s own goal,” Comer said.
The LNG industry is going to have to rein in methane and carbon pollution, not just on the high seas but from extraction to use, if its exports will “play any kind of constructive role in meeting global energy demands,” said Brownstein, with the Environmental Defense Fund.
Those exports don’t show any sign of slowing down. After unloading its fuel in the Netherlands, Energy Intelligence returned to Calcasieu Pass, ready to ferry its next load of fuel across the Atlantic.

Lane Jean, R-Magnolia, addresses the Arkansas House of Representatives on Wednesday, May 1, 2024. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas General Assembly on Wednesday approved legislation to increase the state’s general revenue budget to $6.49 billion for fiscal year 2026, a nearly 3% increase from the previous year. 
As is typical, state lawmakers approved the Revenue Stabilization Act on the final day of the legislative session through two identical bills — Senate Bill 637 and House Bill 2003.
The RSA is nearly identical to the budget Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders proposed in November. The largest portion of the $182.5 million increase to the state budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 is an additional $90 million for the state’s Educational Freedom Account program. 
Arkansas governor presents $6.49 billion budget proposal to state lawmakers

The school voucher program, which permits state funds to be used for allowable expenses such as private school tuition, is expected to see an increase in participation during its third year, when eligibility opens up to all Arkansas students this fall.
The legislation also increases county jail reimbursement by roughly $9 million to $34.8 million. The state reimburses county jails for holding state inmates when there’s no room in Arkansas prisons. Expanding prison capacity has been a priority for Sanders, but lawmakers failed this session to approve a $750 million appropriation bill to support the full estimated cost of a planned prison in Franklin County. 
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, sponsored that bill and told colleagues the estimated total cost of the proposed 3,000-bed penitentiary is $825 million, but several lawmakers said they believe the cost will top $1 billion and were unhappy that the administration couldn’t provide more details on the project. Franklin County residents have also objected to the prison’s location and to the state’s purchase of the property without involving local officials. 
In the House Tuesday, Joint Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Lane Jean, R-Magnolia, highlighted a $13 million increase to the Department of Human Services Grants line item, which he said would support maternal health. 
Sanders in her proposed budget called for a $13 million increase for Medicaid to help support recommendations from the Strategic Committee for Maternal Health that she convened last year to address the state’s poor maternal health outcomes. 
Arkansas has among the nation’s highest maternal and infant mortality rates, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. Arkansas is the only state to have taken no action on a federal option to expand Medicaid postpartum benefits to 12 months from the current 60 days. Sanders has refused to expand coverage, saying to do so would be duplicative of other health insurance options for new mothers.
The RSA also includes $3.15 million for a performance fund that Jean said would support the governor’s new state employee pay plan, which is expected to cost a total of $139 million. Lawmakers last month approved legislation for the plan, which aims to clarify promotion ladders within state agencies and improve recruitment and retention by raising some salaries to labor market rates. State agency leaders should be able to accommodate the updated pay schedule within existing budgets, the governor said last fall.


Let us know what you think...


 

Jean told the House Tuesday that the RSA projects the state would be left with roughly $300,000 in surplus funds, though he noted that would likely be closer to $250,000 because $50,000 would be allocated for highways. That is significantly less than the record billion-dollar surpluses seen in recent years. The decrease in surplus funds could be contributed, in part, to several rounds of tax cuts by Arkansas’ last two governors. Sanders and the Legislature cut taxes three times in 15 months, most recently last June. 
To further support the governor’s proposed budget, lawmakers also approved Senate Bill 636 Wednesday, which would transfer $572.79 million in surplus money to various funds and set-aside accounts. 
“It’s spending a lot of money, I’m not debating that point, but I think it’s all needs that the governor came up with. House got some needs that we asked for, Senate’s got some needs,” Jean said Wednesday.
SB 636 includes an additional $90 million for the EFA program and $100 million for the Medicaid Sustainability Set Aside Fund, among other things. When Sanders proposed these set-aside funds in November, State Budget Director Robert Brech noted they would only be used if necessary and are not part of the RSA, which prioritizes state government spending and balances the budget. 
“It’s not known at this time if those will be necessary,” Brech said then. “In the event they are, those set-asides could be used and then built into the budget afterwards, but what we didn’t want to do is put too much money in the RSA when it wasn’t needed.”
A worksheet for surplus funding and set-asides for the 2025-2027 biennium presented to the Joint Budget Committee Monday also proposed transferring $250 million to a correctional facilities fund through Senate Bill 633. That bill was pulled down Monday.

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.

The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.
 DEI-related cuts

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
 Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
 Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.










There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher


Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

The Tennessee Senate Wednesday voted 70-23 in favor of the legislation  (SB227/HB11) brought by Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis and Rep. Rusty Grills of Newbern, both Republicans. 
The Republican majority in the House approved the measure earlier this month.
Tennessee Senate OKs bill to hold charities liable for aiding immigrants who later commit crime

A spokesperson for Gov. Bill Lee did not respond to a question sent Wednesday about whether he plans to sign the legislation into law. 
Grills called the measure a “public safety bill in keeping with the Trump Administration’s renewed focus on illegal immigration.”
“What we’re doing with this bill is anyone who is a victim of a crime committed by an illegal alien would have a private right of action against any NGO (non-governmental organization) that has assisted the illegal alien with housing in the community,” Grills said in presenting the bill on the Senate floor.
The legislation would open the door to civil lawsuits against charities that provide a variety of long-term housing assistance to individuals regardless of their immigration status, including assistance in signing leases or securing an apartment.
The bill exempts “temporary overnight housing such as that provided by a homeless shelter,” but includes no specific exemption for other short-term housing, such as domestic violence shelters, which can house victims and their children for months at a time. 
Bills that target immigrant-serving nonprofits raise criticism from faith community 

Charities would be subject to lawsuits if their “conduct in providing housing constitutes negligence, gross negligence, or willful and wanton misconduct.” The bill’s language does not include a definition of those terms in the context of providing physical housing, referrals for housing or assistance in signing apartment leases.
The measure has drawn pushback from Tennessee faith leaders as an infringement on their religious freedom to perform acts of charity to those in need. 
On the Senate floor earlier this month, the bill drew contentious debate, with Democrat Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville criticizing the measure as holding charities responsible for “crimes committed by someone they helped” while Taylor — the bill’s sponsor — called it a “misguided mission” to serve immigrants without legal status. 
House Republicans quickly moved for a vote Wednesday, forestalling any floor debate, even as Democrats audibly protested the maneuver.

(Getty Images)For the past six years, I worked as a public defender in Ada County, representing people in child protection, misdemeanor and felony cases. Even though the work was often mentally and emotionally taxing, I found a sense of purpose and community in it, and I took great pride in giving people a fair chance in court if they couldn’t afford an attorney on their own.
However, I resigned in November of last year without having another job lined up because the changes to the public defense system made it impossible for me to do my job. 
Idaho governor approves increase in state public defense budget

Last October, Idaho transitioned the oversight of public defense away from being managed by each county to the singular Office of the State Public Defender in Boise. This changeover has been underfunded and mismanaged, directly leading to violations of defendants’ constitutional rights, the mass exodus of attorneys and staff, and increased caseloads for those who stayed. It has not remedied the ongoing problems that led the ACLU of Idaho to sue the state in 2015. 
The statewide overhaul was Idaho’s solution to the lawsuit filed 10 years ago against the state demanding Idaho overhaul the public defense system because it was not adequately meeting the demands of people needing an attorney assigned to them by the court. The transition to the state public defender system was supposed to improve the situation, but so far, things have only gotten worse.
In the months leading up to the transition, public defense staff were apprehensive about the changes because our basic questions still had no answers. Will we still have access to the jail and prison to visit our clients? Will our emails change? Are we expected to travel to other counties?
Rather than answer those questions, the state announced significant pay cuts for employees in July 2024, affecting those who had dedicated years of service to public defense, with some cuts reaching as high as $40,000 a year. This led to a change in our working conditions, turning from a supportive environment to one filled with tension and uncertainty, prompting a wave of resignations. In addition to the pay cuts, the state’s poorly executed rollout of new technology last September left public defenders unable to communicate with clients in jail for a month, further hampering our ability to provide an adequate defense. 
Despite this, the leadership at the Office of the State Public Defender has issued statements minimizing concerns about staffing shortages and mismanagement, failing to address the mounting issues and leaving attorneys and staff overwhelmed by higher workloads, bureaucratic delays and inefficiencies. The gap between defendants and their constitutional right to an attorney continued to grow wider.
While I have sympathy for such a daunting task as overhauling a state’s public defense system, patience only goes so far when the leaders of the clearly underfunded and rushed overhaul seem impervious to feedback, ignoring legitimate complaints and severe shortages.
Idaho’s elected leaders must acknowledge the crisis our public defense system is in and remedy it. 
When I made the difficult choice to leave, it was because I lost hope that the situation would improve. I still struggle with the guilt of feeling like I abandoned my clients, and the guilt of knowing my departure made it even that much more difficult for the attorneys who remain, trying to serve clients amidst the chaos. My mental health was suffering, my clients were suffering, my colleagues were suffering, and we were all being told there was no problem. 
This is simply unacceptable. 
This must be addressed. We are absolutely in crisis mode. 
Step one is to acknowledge the rollout of the SPD has been fraught with mistakes and mismanagement. Step two is to fix it. Step three is to create a system of transparency and good leadership to oversee the system moving forward. 
We cannot wait any longer for a fix. Every day that does not happen is another day too many more Idahoans are robbed of their constitutional rights. I am begging our elected officials to act immediately to address this severe crisis.

As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.










Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug


“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Indiana Republican leadership seems as opposed as ever to marijuana legalization. In fact, this year bills are moving to ban advertising the illegal product in the state.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
Headed for the ballot
In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
Pot smell and safety concerns ignite disputes over public smoking

“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
Targeting potency, revenues
In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.

Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Stephen Smith | The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.
DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.














There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher





Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Photo:John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee House Republicans  voted overwhelmingly to transfer responsibilities for investigating discrimination complaints to the office of the Tennessee Attorney General, effectively dissolving the Tennessee Human Rights Commission. 
The measure passed 73-23 with less than 10 minutes of discussion. 
Democrats questioned Rep. Johnny Garrett, a Goodlettsville Republican who sponsored the bill, about the need to dismantle the independent agency and raised doubts about the ability of Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti to investigate complaints without bias. 
“For some reason, I think the politics that have already infected the AG’s office will also make its way into Title VI and other public policies enforced by the Human Rights Commission,” said Rep. G.A. Hardaway, a Memphis Democrat. “I can think of no reason to move (investigative capacity) except to make it susceptible to the politics of the AG’s office.”
Title VI refers to federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities that receive federal funding, including state government.
Bill to abolish discrimination watchdog agency advances in Tennessee Legislature

Skrmetti has led or joined lawsuits that include a challenge to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s rule prohibiting discrimination against women seeking abortions, litigation seeking to stop transgender medical care for minors and sent letters to corporations warning them against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, among other actions.
Garrett said the only change to how claims of discrimination will be investigated is the move to a new Civil Rights Division within the attorney general’s office — although the legislature will lose the oversight authority it currently has over the Human Rights Commission.
Rep. Sam McKenzie, a Knoxville Democrat, called the attorney general’s office “a ginormous organization that’s getting fatter every day.”
The 2026 state budget, which the House passed earlier Wednesday, includes $4.5 million to expand the attorney general’s special litigation unit, which was created to investigate former President Joe Biden’s policies. Funding for the Human Rights Commission would also be transferred to the attorney general’s department should the bill become law.
The 60-year-old commission is a nonpartisan and independent agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws in employment, housing and public accommodation as well as discrimination claims against the state of Tennessee.  
Under the measure, the commission will be dissolved by July 1 and its 30 staff positions will move to the attorney general’s office. 
The Senate version of the bill, sponsored by Huntingdon Republican Rep. John Stevens, is slated to go next to the Senate Calendar Committee. No date has been set for that but the legislature is expected to wrap up for the year in the next week.

Riley Moore, R-W.Va., toured the El Salvador prison CECOT on Tuesday, April 15, 2025, and posted a photo of himself giving two thumbs up in front of prisoners on his X account. (Rep. Riley Moore X account)If a sitting member of the United States House of Representatives and third generation member of a political dynasty taking a selfie and posing with double thumbs up while dressed in his business casual in front of stripped down inmates in a foreign country as part of a PR campaign for a controversial and legally suspect American policy to send more individuals there sounds wrong, it is because it is.
Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., took a trip away from his 2nd Congressional District of West Virginia and his Washington, D.C. office to El Salvador to get what is becoming a highly-sought photo-op for GOP members these days. Inside the CECOT prison with a background of caged inmates, Moore took a selfie, a posed picture with his thumbs up. To this he, or his social media intern, added two photos of inmates, a few lines about murderers and rapists, then, “I leave now even more determined to support President Trump’s efforts to secure our homeland” and posted it to his social media accounts. 
Not mentioned in the PR campaign is how CECOT is the lynchpin of El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele’s political persona. Bukele’s rise to power was on the promise to crack down on crime, which as president he has mercilessly done while incarcerating tens of thousands in the process. Filling up CECOT with “brutal criminals, including murderers, rapists, pedophiles and terrorists” made him extremely popular. Which is step one in the dictator’s playbook. The following steps came next. Bukele consolidated power and popularity by going after “they” and “them” and “those” because how dare you quibble over due process and “rights” for gang members. Then came ignoring laws, marching armed soldiers into the Legislative Assembly, and serving his current term in direct violation of the constitution with some good, old fashioned court packing to approve it. 
CECOT isn’t just a prison; it’s a symbol of taking care of a problem — extremely high crime — and also a living warning that the crime can return, and anyone who dares question the methods of keeping all that bad at bay will find themselves in the mass cells themselves. “Without me, this” while pointing at the worst of the worst  is the power hungry dictator’s soundbite version of sine qua non. And far too often, as history shows again and again, it works.  
Easy to see why President Donald Trump is using CECOT as his tool of choice for the deportation policy he is pursuing. Bukele is walking proof of what history has shown again and again about responding to fear and how a strongman can capitalize on that fear. Immigration is Trump’s highest polling issue, even as his numbers continue to slip on everything else. The rhetoric of the two leaders has plenty of overlap, with the ends of stopping criminals justifying the means. Even when the means are legally suspect and innocent people become collateral damage. Thus the military planes instead of commercial airliners, the highly-produced videos of the deportations and brutal intake into CECOT, the obstinance against any pushback legal, moral or otherwise. The bad has to be bad enough to excuse the bad of how it is being done to otherwise good people who would just say “no, this is bad.”
The answers to any challenge will mirror those of Trump and Bukele, the surrogates in the media, and the army of social media accounts all falling in line to the policy without bothering with those sticky little details like the law, due process, and unintended consequences. Daring to bring those issues up means you are with the bad people, not with the good people. Bukele, who openly brags about being “the world’s coolest dictator” understands that popularity on one big issue brings power over all other issues. 
Holding a Master’s degree from National Defense University and having previously been a staffer for the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, it isn’t that Moore doesn’t know this background, or understand how dictatorships take hold, or couldn’t have dug deeper into why the Trump Administration is using El Salvador. It is well within his purview to do a fact-finding trip on the process and policy. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee Moore is positioned to have more influence, should he choose to use it, than the average freshman representative normally would, even members whose aunts aren’t the sitting senior U.S. Senator from the state represented. 
He just doesn’t care. Moore chose to be at the front of the line of the PR campaign posing with thumbs up in a brutal foreign prison instead of using his elected office to ask the basic and self-evident question: why our president was using CECOT in the first place. Moore pinned to the top of his X account that seeing the “brutal criminals, including murderers, rapists, pedophiles, and terrorists” leaves him “even more determined to support President Trump’s efforts.” The popularity of the policy to the base of his party is a path to his own future power, and why mess that up by bothering the electorate with lectures on laws and morals that go against their politically pliable feels?
Moore wanted to tell all of us something very important about himself with that El Salvador selfie. Believe him.

However, KDE has not paused or suspended any of its existing programs since receiving a request from the U.S. Department of Education to complete a form certifying its compliance with Trump administration interpretations of civil rights law. Kentucky Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher also said the state department will continue working with its partners “to build an education system that is responsive and relentlessly focused on student success.”
In a letter to superintendents sent last weekend, Fletcher wrote that the U.S. Education Department’s certification form “is not without issues,” but he is still “confident that through our statewide commitment to providing opportunity and access for every student, we can advance towards meeting the needs and ensuring the success of each student in Kentucky’s public schools.” 
According to the federal agency’s form, “any violation of Title VI — including the use of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (‘DEI’) programs to advantage one’s race over another — is impermissible” and using “certain DEI practices can violate federal law.” The form outlines possible consequences — such as  losing federal funding or facing a federal lawsuit — for a state or local education agency that protects a DEI program. Title VI of the 1963 Civil Rights Act It prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. 
The U.S. Education Department asked the Kentucky department to distribute the certification forms to local school district officials for their signatures. Fletcher’s letter said all Kentucky school districts have “previously assured KDE of such compliance” and will do so annually in the future. 
“As previously recommended, school districts should consult with board counsel on whether the district will sign the Certification Form,” Fletcher wrote. 
The federal department’s targeting of DEI practices comes as Republicans at the national and state levels have pushed to roll back such measures, particularly in education. The GOP-controlled Kentucky General Assembly recently passed a law banning DEI programs at Kentucky public universities and colleges. Shortly after he assumed office in January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at eliminating DEI programs within the federal government. 
Backlash against DEI programs has grown since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in higher education admissions in 2023. The ruling is cited in the form the U.S. Department of Education is asking school officials to sign.. 
In general, DEI initiatives focus on supporting marginalized people in areas where they have been historically excluded. 
The U.S. Education Department previously threatened to rescind federal funding for schools in a February letter if they use DEI, or race-conscious practices, in admissions, programming, training, hiring, scholarships and other resources for students. 
In a statement to the Kentucky Lantern, Fletcher said he is “committed to ensuring that every student—regardless of race, background, language, socioeconomic status, or zip code — has access to a high-quality education and vibrant learning opportunities to succeed.” 
“That means removing barriers, expanding support for English learners, and providing all students with the resources they need to thrive,” Fletcher added. “Our schools must be places where every child feels supported and challenged to reach their full potential. We will continue to work with educators, families, and communities to build an education system that is responsive and relentlessly focused on student success.”
Earlier this month, the U.S. Education Department sent a letter asking states and districts to provide certifications they were complying with the order within 10 days or risk losing federal funding. The department then delayed the deadline to sign its form until after April 24 following an agreement between it and groups suing the federal department over the directive. The National Education Association, a teachers union, and the American Civil Liberties Union are challenging the directive in court. 
Kentucky’s legislature has not outlawed DEI in public schools, although legislation was filed in the 2025 General Assembly to roll back such programs. Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, filed bills that would have prohibited DEI initiatives in Kentucky’s public schools and state and local governments.

(Photo courtesy of Virginia Military Institute)The Virginia Military Institute is once again navigating turbulent waters after the abrupt resignation of board president John Adams — and the installation of a high-profile political donor as his short-term replacement.
Thomas Gottwald, chairman and CEO of NewMarket Corporation, was elected interim president of the VMI Board of Visitors on Wednesday, less than a week after Adams resigned without public explanation. The move was first reported by The Washington Post.
Gottwald, a 1983 graduate of VMI and a longtime supporter of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, was appointed to the board by the governor. Like most of the current board, he is aligned with the administration. Gottwald received 10 of the 13 votes, defeating fellow nominee Damon Williams, a bank officer and co-founder of the nonprofit Youth Sports Inc. 
He will serve the remainder of Adams’ term through the end of June. 
In brief remarks following the vote, Gottwald thanked the board for its support and outlined a short-term focus on budget planning and improved communication with alumni.
“My interest is in serving out John’s term, which ends at the end of June,” Gottwald said. “I do not have an interest in continuing beyond that point, and so my effort will be focused on May and June. At the upcoming board meeting, we can elect a president and vice presidents that will, together with the newly constituted board in July and new superintendent, be in a good position to move us forward.”
Gottwald has been a major donor to Youngkin’s political efforts and to the Spirit of VMI PAC, a group composed of alumni, parents and students that has pushed back against diversity reforms and called on supporters to “reject the woke assault on VMI.”
During the meeting, VMI Superintendent Ret. Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins emphasized that the next board president will play a critical role in setting a tone of stability and leadership at a time when public trust in the institution is in flux.
“They’ll have to be focused on how to reinforce and endorse the work that’s being done by the institute and the leaders of the institute to fulfill the mission, to drive towards the vision and uphold the values of the institute,” Wins said.
Wins, who did not recommend any candidates for the position, criticized the board’s recent focus on what he called the “mundane and the trivial” — including debates over The Cadet, a publication backed by cadets and alumni — rather than academic and strategic priorities.
He also noted that several members have walked away from their responsibilities in recent years, leaving the institution in what he described as a vulnerable position.
“Does the next board president have the staying power to deal with the challenges of the institute alongside the superintendent and be fully supportive of the direction,” he asked, “or is the board member if they have an agenda or they see things differently, are they going to walk off the board and leave the hard work to the remaining members of the board and institute officials?”
 The superintendent search

Gottwald’s election as an interim board president comes at a pivotal moment for VMI, as a search committee begins the process of replacing Wins — the first Black leader in the institution’s history — following the board’s controversial vote to end his tenure after four and half years.
On Feb. 28, the board voted 6-10 against renewing Wins’ contract. Then-president Adams had previously expressed appreciation for Wins’ leadership, even after voting with the majority. The board is largely composed of appointees selected by Youngkin.
In the wake of the vote, Wins said his departure stemmed from “bias, emotion, and ideology” rather than objective decision-making. 
The political tensions surrounding Wins’ tenure are tied closely to his efforts to expand diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as Title IX protections. In 2022, he requested $6.1 million in state funding to support these efforts — a move that drew strong backlash from some alumni and conservative groups.
Despite the board’s decision, the search to replace Wins is underway. Last month, the superintendent search committee met to review logistical and legal guidance for the hiring process. The group also worked with the selected executive search firm, Buffkin/Baker, to outline stakeholder surveys, refine the search timeline, and establish priorities for the role.
Details of the search process have been made publicly available on VMI’s superintendent search webpage.
The committee includes seven board members and six advisory members and is co-chaired by C. Ernest Edgar IV and Jamie Inman — who were opposite sides of the vote to renew Wins’ contract. Edgar supported renewing, while Inman opposed.
Inman, who previously served as VMI’s chief of staff and special assistant to former Superintendent Ret. Gen. J.H. Binford Peay III, was appointed to the board by Youngkin in June 2023.

(Photo courtesy of John Seymour)Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares and 38 other attorneys general want Congress to pass a bill to prohibit pharmacy benefit managers from owning or operating pharmacies, according to a letter Miyares co-signed Monday. 
Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or PBMs, act as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. PBMs retain rebates and discounts from contracts, leaving consumers and pharmacies unsure how much savings are actually being passed on. That lack of transparency has raised bipartisan concern among Virginia lawmakers.
In their letter, Miyares and other AGs assert that PBMs’ use of pharmacies owned by themselves or their parent company “has exacerbated the problem of manipulated prices and unavailability of certain prescription medications.”
“PBMs were originally created to streamline prescription drug access and reduce costs for patients, but they’ve become powerful gatekeepers,” Miyares said in a press release announcing he’d signed onto the joint letter. “Virginians and Americans deserve better, and I’m fighting to ensure they get it.” 
In urging congressional action, the attorneys general argue that banning PBMs or their parent companies from pharmacy ownership would “allow pharmacies to compete on fair terms and create a market that is more accessible to consumers.”
Meanwhile, Virginia lawmakers have already worked on ways to reform PBMs at the state level. 
This year, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers passed a bill that would eliminate health-plan-run PBMs in Medicaid and establish a single state-contracted one. This move, supporters say, would improve accountability, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat.
Lawmakers push back on Youngkin budget, pass bipartisan bills on probation, dangerous driving

More than addressing drug costs for patients, some advocates stressed that reform can help support rural healthcare access and small businesses. 
“I know what it’s like to spend $10 to make $5 back from Medicaid,” said Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell, who has owned an independent pharmacy. 
“We’re the first line,” Blacksburg-area pharmacist Jeremy Counts told The Mercury earlier this year. 
He emphasized how local pharmacies serve as key access points for prescriptions, vaccines and physician consultations for rural patients where hospitals are not always nearby. With both national and local pharmacy closures on the rise, Counts warned of “pharmacy deserts” and patient access issues, especially in Southwest Virginia. 
After the bill passed the legislature with bipartisan support, Gov. Glenn Youngkin sought an amendment to study the move rather than charge forward with creating a state-run PBM 
“We do not need more studies,” Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, one of the bill’s patrons, said Wednesday. “This is a true bipartisan bill.” 
When the legislature reconvened earlier this month, the PBM bill was among those whose gubernatorial recommendations were rejected. Now Youngkin has until May 2 to sign the bills into law as they passed, or veto them.

Americans have many big and important differences these days, but if we can’t come together to agree on a handful of fundamental ideals and human rights that have been baked into our Constitution and way of life for over two centuries, we’re in big trouble.
And one of those fundamentals is the simple idea that government cannot suddenly seize and imprison any person — much less deport them to a foreign gulag — without due process and the right to defend themselves in open court.
Tragically, however, the Trump administration has been trashing this fundamental right of late by, quite literally, empowering masked and armed officers to simply seize people on the street and whisk them off to unknown sites.
Such disappearances represent a despicable betrayal of everything our nation supposedly stands for.
The bottom line: Whatever their disagreements on other issues, it’s imperative that all North Carolina elected leaders of both major parties stand up, speak out and demand an immediate end to these outrageous and unconstitutional acts. Our nation’s status as a free country is on the line.

(File photo by Josh Kurtz/Maryland Matters)More than 100 property owners in Central Maryland have refused to let power company PSEG onto their land to survey for the proposed Piedmont power line project, the company said in a legal filing Tuesday.
In a 53-page filing with the U.S. District Court for Maryland — at least 14 pages of which is a listing of defendants — the New Jersey-based company is seeking an order that would let it access the properties with a minimum of 24 hours notice, and prohibit the property owners from interfering.
In its filing, the company said that despite “numerous real and bona fide efforts” to obtain consent from landowners, each has refused.
“Despite our efforts to engage with property owners and even offer reasonable compensation, we have been unable to gain voluntary access from a sufficient number of property owners that will allow us to conduct these environmental surveys,” PSEG said in an April 9 public statement, which also warned that lawsuits could be coming.
The company said it had offered financial compensation to landowners who allowed temporary access for the “noninvasive environmental surveys.” But it said in the filing that an “organized and funded opposition, led by STOP MPRP, Inc.” has “urged property owners to refuse the Company access.”
The group was convened last year, after community members first learned of the power line project, known as the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project — and grew concerned that the 67-mile power transmission line would destroy tracts of rural land in Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties.
The all-volunteer organization is funded entirely by donations and membership payments, said Joanne Frederick, a co-founder and president of the board of directors.
As demand for AI rises, so do power-thirsty data centers

“People have the right to say no when someone wants to come on their land,” Frederick said. “And as an organization, we made people aware of their rights to say no.”
Frederick called Tuesday’s court filing from PSEG “another attack” on local landowners, who were startled to learn of PSEG’s plans for the line, and the possibility that it could use eminent domain to acquire land.
“PSEG wants to come onto peoples’ properties to do surveys, so they can use that information to strengthen their application to then later come and take our land,” Frederick said. “Do we, as landowners, have to make it easier for someone to take our land?”
STOP MPRP said Wednesday evening that it had retained legal counsel “to advise our organization on the best course of action to support our members and affected landowners,” and it urged Gov. Wes Moore (D) to issue a public statement in support of the landowners.
Frederick said distrust for PSEG abounds in the community, and some residents are concerned that the surveys could do damage to their properties — or that the data gathered could be distorted to suit PSEG’s needs.
PSEG is completing the surveying — including forest, wetland and sensitive species assessments — as part of its application before the Maryland Public Service Commission for the power line, filed in December. The commission, which regulates utilities in the state, must issue a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity before the project can go forward.
Only after PSC approval could the company seek to use eminent domain. In a prior public statement, the company called it an “option of last resort,” adding that it would only be used “to maintain reliable electric infrastructure for all Marylanders.”
The transmission line was commissioned by PJM Interconnection, the electric grid operator serving Maryland and 12 other states, as well as Washington, DC. It would connect a Baltimore Gas & Electric right-of-way in northern Baltimore County to the Doubs Substation in Frederick County.
PJM has said that it commissioned the Piedmont line, along with other transmission projects, to account for increased energy demand, including from power-hungry data centers like the ones in Northern Virginia, and the loss of energy supply thanks to retiring fossil fuel generators.
In its legal filing, PSEG said it is obligated, under an agreement with PJM, to bring the power line into service by June 2027, and to do so, it must begin construction by January 2026.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
If the court does not grant access for the surveying, PSEG would be forced to redraw the power line route, and resubmit its application with the Maryland PSC, the company said. But a different route may not change the outcome, because of the significant community pushback, PSEG said.
“Based on public comments and correspondence the Company has received to date, it is likely that the Company would encounter additional opposition with any alternative proposed line,” reads the lawsuit. “This, in turn, would likely put the Company in exactly the same position in which it finds itself now: seeking Court intervention.”
So far, PSEG has paid nearly $1.6 million to siting and environmental consultants, and $1.3 million to a real estate firm helping contact relevant property owners, according to the company’s lawsuit. Resubmitting an application would likely require the company to incur those fees all over again, and jeopardize the project’s timeline, the suit stated.
Frederick said that PSEG is essentially “asking landowners to either give up and just allow this to happen, or hire what could be very costly attorneys to protect their own land rights,” adding that the impacted property owners include elderly individuals, and some who have never been involved in legal proceedings before.
“We’re standing together. People are resolute. I do not believe that this latest foray will suddenly cause people to just give up,” Frederick said.
Frederick, who lives on a farm property impacted by the route, said she is one of the landowners who was sued earlier this week. If the power line is constructed, she said that she stands to lose about 5 acres of forest on her property, which contains conservation and forest buffer easements.
She purchased the property in 2020. It was a one-time dairy farm, once owned by her great-grandparents, that was sold out of the family in 2004 and fell into disrepair. For the past five years, Frederick said she has been working to restore the farm and her family’s legacy.
But PSEG’s project threatens to upend that, she said. That’s why she has thrown herself into the opposition effort, she said.
“It has been all-consuming,” Frederick said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20240829_125307-2048x921-1-e1735746730455-1024x584.jpg,,,2025-04-17 06:00:10.150798

The board said that it found “no cause to take disciplinary action” against 205 of the Maryland cases linked to “Operation Nightingale,” a multistate investigation by federal official in 2023 of a Florida-based wire fraud scheme that provided bogus documentation of nursing credentials.
The board did revoke the “privilege to practice in Maryland” for three nurses and voted to issue charges against seven others, who were referred to the Office of the Attorney General for prosecution. Three nurses voluntarily surrendered their licenses, another 12 applicants withdrew their applications for a registered nurse license in Maryland and the board voted to dispose of another three without taking action.
Those numbers were included in the board’s response to an Office of Legislative Audits report released last week that was a followup to a 2024 inquiry into several boards and commissions that oversee health care facilities or practitioners.
Among the findings of the report, which covered the period from September 2019 to July 2023, was that the agencies often failed to investigate complaints against licensees in a timely manner — a problem the auditors said could be due to staffing shortages during that period.
The report said that the 20 boards and commissions it studied had a total of 4,916 open cases as of February 2024, but that 3,051 of those had been open more than two years. The Board of Nursing, the largest by far of all the boards, had 2,411 cases that had been open more than two years, it said.

The auditors also reported in February 2024 that the nursing board could not provide documentation that it had investigated any of the 259 nurses whose names came up as part of Operation Nightingale — a claim the board disputed at the time, and again last week.
The board now says it is missing documentation for just 26 of those 259. While that is a significant improvement, the OLA report adds on to other audits that raise concerns in oversight and documentation of Board of Nursing and the Department of Health over several years.
The Operation Nightingale investigation became public in a January 2023 post from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. It said its investigation, along with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, uncovered three Florida nursing schools tied to “bogus” nursing degree diplomas and transcripts that were sold to “aspiring” Registered Nurses (RN) and Licensed Practical/Vocational Nurse (LPN/VN) to qualify for the national nursing board exam.
“Upon successful completion of the board exam, the nursing applicants became eligible to obtain licensure in various states,” the HHS statement said. “Once licensed, the individuals were then able to obtain employment in the health care field. The overall scheme involved the distribution of more than 7,600 fake nursing diplomas and transcripts. These schools are now closed.”
Former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Markenzy Lapointe said at the time that the wire fraud scheme “erodes public trust in our health care system.”
“Not only is this a public safety concern, it also tarnishes the reputation of nurses who actually complete the demanding clinical and course work required to obtain their professional licenses and employment,” Lapointe said in the 2023 statement.
The Maryland Board of Nursing was notified of 287 nurses or nursing applicants who may have received licensure with false credentials, with the expectation that the Maryland board would look into those cases. By February 2024, the board said it had reviewed most of those cases, even though the OLA said it lacked documentation at the time for that claim. At that time, 131 of those nurses had been working within the Maryland health system, the OLA said.
The Board of Nursing agreed that the audit’s findings were factual and has since located much of the missing documentation regarding those 259 nursing licenses — though documentation for 26 cases are still missing.
“Board of Nursing has located a substantial amount of the records documenting the work conducted to screen and process the 259 individuals who may have obtained licensure in Maryland using fraudulent credentials,” the board responded in the April audit report.
The board believes that it will resolve the outstanding 26 cases by July. The Board of Nursing has a list of the actions it has taken related to nursing licenses involved in Operation Nightingale.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed became the second Democrat to enter the race for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat on Thursday.
El-Sayed, who ran for governor in 2018, joins state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) in seeking the seat after incumbent U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) announced that he would not seek re-election.
Other potential candidates include U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit). Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) have also been mentioned as possible Democratic candidates.
El-Sayed said in an interview with the Michigan Advance that he chose to run because “it’s way too hard to get by in Michigan right now, and in the richest, most powerful country in the world, folks shouldn’t have to struggle so hard to afford basic things.”
He said he thinks about the effect rising costs are having on everyday people he met during his 2018 campaign.
“You can just see it grinding them down in ways that shouldn’t have to happen,” El-Sayed said. “I look at what Trump and Musk are doing, and frankly, they’re just making it so much worse. We’ve got to step up and we’ve got to fight back, and I think that happens best in the seat in the U.S. Senate.”

After suffering defeat to President Donald Trump in the last election, El-Sayed says Democrats must “speak plainly about issues of direct relevance to people’s lives in ways that are easy to understand and to embrace, and we have to run on public policy that has direct impact on people’s lives as immediately as possible.”
“I think sometimes when it comes to the way that we run, we try to tact or triangulate to the least common denominator of what we think everybody can be okay with, and I think that makes us seem inauthentic, and it leaves us sounding like we don’t really have anything to say at all,” El-Sayed said.
He said it’s not enough to simply fight against the Trump administration, arguing that Democrats must also articulate a positive, forward-looking message about what they plan to do.
He pointed to universal health coverage, environmental regulations, affordable housing and reigning in corporations and the ultrawealthy as priorities.
“I feel really well placed in a race like this, because I have the opportunity both to be that fighter who stands up to Donald Trump and Elon Musk and all their acolytes, but also to have the skills to be able to build after they’re gone,” El-Sayed said. “And I think there’s going to be a lot of wreckage that they leave in their wake.”
El-Sayed pointed to his time as the director of the Detroit Health Department from 2015 to 2017 as evidence that he is “able to build in the circumstances of wreckage that politicians leave behind.”
But while El-Sayed critiqued Democrats’ messaging, he is taking a different approach than his former boss, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who is running for governor as an independent and has said that the Democratic and Republican parties have a “death grip” on Michigan politics.
“When parties aren’t delivering for folks, the question isn’t to run outside the party, it’s to have the courage to rethink what your party ought to be doing,” El-Sayed said. “I’ve had my fair share of disagreements with the Democratic Party on a number of issues, and what I’m trying to do about it is to demonstrate the capacity to win elections by campaigning on the issues that I believe in.”
While El-Sayed said there is a short-term urgency to fighting back against the Trump administration, he added that Democrats must also address what he described as a broken political system that allowed Trump to be elected in the first place.
“If you’re unable to address the circumstances that Donald Trump exploited to get elected in 2016 in the first place, then I worry that all you’re doing is kind of your own version of Make America Great Again; it’s just 2015 instead of somewhere in the 1930s, where Donald Trump seems to want to be dragging us,” El-Sayed said.
But many of those policy goals would be difficult to get through the Senate if the filibuster remains in place, El-Sayed said, arguing that it “has served to interfere with more progressive legislation and, frankly, interfere with our ability to deliver on what we say it is that we want to do which has redounded to the benefit of Republicans.”
“Remember, at the end of the day, their governing philosophy is that government is part of the problem, ours is that government is part of the solution,” El-Sayed said. “So anything that stops the government from working inevitably redounds to their benefit.”
El-Sayed said the filibuster is “anti-democratic on its own terms.”
“The idea that one U.S. senator can block legislation for the entire country, it does not comport with the ideals of democracy,” El-Sayed said. 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was widely criticized for breaking a Democratic filibuster to advance a Republican-backed stopgap funding bill earlier this year. El-Sayed declined to commit to supporting any specific candidate to be the Democratic leader if elected, saying he would have to see who seeks the role before making any decisions.
“Anybody who tells you that they’re going to support one person or another without knowing who the alternative is, is just either unsophisticated or unnuanced about the choice in front of you,” El-Sayed said.
McMorrow has indicated that she would not support Schumer to continue as Democratic leader.
Michigan’s soon-to-be senior U.S. senator, Elissa Slotkin, made similar waves in her 2018 campaign for the U.S. House, when she vowed to withhold support from Nancy Pelosi as House Speaker.
El-Sayed said he would find common ground with Slotkin on issues like workers’ rights and environmental protections while “leading on those issues that my background and my experience give me particular expertise on,” like health care.
“She and I are very different people, but what better representation in the state of Michigan than a Jewish woman and a Muslim man,” El-Sayed said.
El-Sayed said he made the decision to run for the U.S. Senate rather than making a second attempt at becoming governor in part after he watched federal funding that the Wayne County Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services get caught in a federal funding freeze.
“I’ve asked myself, where is the fight now? 43% of the state’s budget is federal funds, and I think it’s going to be really difficult for anybody leading our state if Trump and Musk continue to do what they are doing and decimate a lot of the funding that the state relies on,” El-Sayed said. “And so, to me, I think the locus of the fight has to be at the Senate.”
El-Sayed appeared last month at a rally with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in Warren that drew more than 10,000 people, filling three overflow rooms with an additional crowd gathered outside.

He said the level of enthusiasm “demonstrates a real hunger for a politics that is direct, that is unapologetic and that is consistent with the needs and frustrations that people have in this moment.”
“That, for me, was a really, really important testing point for the argument that we are making here, which is that if we are serious about winning elections in the future, then Democrats have to be serious about being honest, direct and clear about what we fight for, not just what we fight against,” El-Sayed said.
That also extends to the primary, El-Sayed said, saying that one of the mistakes of his 2018 campaign – which ultimately ended with now-Gov. Gretchen Whitmer sweeping all 83 counties – was being too focused on the other candidates in the primary.
“Sometimes we missed the opportunity to just demonstrate – to show people, not tell them – why I’d be the best candidate for them and for the future,” El-Sayed said.
But while that campaign ended nearly seven years ago, he said he’s not concerned about recapturing momentum and standing out in a potentially crowded primary field.
“If there’s any upside, politically, to having a name like mine, it’s that it’s not one that people soon forget,” El-Sayed said.
“If we’re willing to have a very clear conversation that starts with listening and that articulates what we want to deliver, I’m pretty certain that Michiganders are going to remember my name.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMR_0461-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 05:03:42.763763

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) As Republicans in Congress consider cutting the federal share of Medicaid funding, states are weighing numerous options to scale back their programs. But voters in three states have significantly limited those options by enshrining Medicaid expansion in their constitutions — creating a potential budget disaster and a political challenge for the GOP.
Over the past several years, voters in conservative Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have amended their state constitutions to require their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the age of 65 who earn equal to or less than 138% of the federal poverty level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Those states are among the 40 plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost.
But much of that federal funding could soon vanish. Republicans in Congress are debating several options to achieve $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. One proposal would slash the 90% rate to the lower match rates states get for the traditional Medicaid population, mainly children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Those percentages range from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
If Congress goes that route, states would have to come up with $626 billion over the next decade to keep the roughly 20 million people in the expansion population on the rolls.
Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have laws on the books that would automatically roll back Medicaid expansion if the federal funds dip. Some states are considering requiring people to work, go to school or volunteer in order to receive Medicaid benefits, a condition that would trim the rolls and save money.
But because Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have put Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, they can’t easily take those steps.
Republicans in Congress are eyeing cuts to Medicaid. But what does Medicaid actually do?

“Legislators cannot change that law without going back to voters for a whole other campaign to change the constitution,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit that helped put the constitutional amendments on the ballot in all three states.
“Even if the federal government cuts their contribution towards funding Medicaid expansion, those three states do not have the option to reduce eligibility or benefits for the Medicaid expansion population,” she told Stateline. “They will have to find those resources.”
Medicaid is a huge component of state budgets. Including the federal matching money, states spend an average of nearly a third of their budgets on Medicaid. And the program is also the single largest source of federal funds for states.
Missourians voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid in August 2020. When state lawmakers refused to fund the expansion, residents sued the state’s Department of Social Services. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had to find the resources for Medicaid expansion — a huge win for progressives.
For 2025, Missouri allotted $18.2 billion for Medicaid, with the federal government covering $12.7 billion of that, or about 70%. If Congress cuts the federal share of Medicaid funding by $880 billion over the next decade, it would leave Missouri with a budget hole of around $1.7 billion next year, according to research from nonprofit group the Commonwealth Fund. That would force the state to come up with some options to avoid fiscal disaster.
Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, told Stateline that these include raising taxes, cutting enrollment for other Medicaid populations, diminishing reimbursements to providers, getting rid of optional medical services such as dental care or ceasing payments for equipment like wheelchairs.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Raising taxes is not a likely or popular choice in Republican-leaning Missouri, McBride noted, while adding that cuts to providers would further endanger struggling hospitals.
“We lost 10 hospitals in Missouri in the last few years. And if you start cutting their payment rates, that’s going to just put them at risk,” McBride said. “The real money is in the disabled and the elderly populations. And so if you really wanted to quote-unquote save money, that’s probably where you’d have to look. But that’s really controversial.”
The state budgetary implications of a potentially sharp decline in federal Medicaid funding have influenced some prominent opponents of Medicaid expansion to have a change of heart. U.S. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018 when he was Missouri’s attorney general. Now, Hawley has said he would refuse to vote for any Medicaid cuts.
“I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts, benefit cuts. Work requirements are fine. But 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. That’s a lot of people,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill in February.
Republicans in the closely divided U.S. Congress might have trouble pushing through Medicaid cuts if other conservative lawmakers from Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota follow Hawley’s lead.
Oklahoma voters expanded Medicaid via a constitutional amendment in 2020. South Dakota followed suit in 2022. Republicans in all three states want to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, but doing so would not save enough money to make up for the loss of federal dollars.
South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson said he respects that voters chose to expand Medicaid, and added that the state has “faithfully” implemented it. But the decision to amend the state constitution “can only be described as a foolish decision,” he said in an interview.










Now, as we're staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid … our state is hamstrung.


– South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson


“A constitution is not meant to be a flexible document that you change annually or even every other year,” Mortenson said. “And so now, as we’re staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid, including for the expansion population, our state is hamstrung in that we cannot effectively respond to those changes.”
Mortenson is one of the lead sponsors of a bill that would ask voters to consider a ballot measure in the next general election to amend the constitution again, this time conditioning Medicaid expansion on the level of federal assistance. The measure has passed both chambers of the legislature.
But some of the supporters of the original constitutional amendment say they would fight any attempt to change it. Any restrictions, including work requirements, would severely harm working-class people, said Doug Sombke, head of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Sombke told Stateline that most farmers in the state struggle to make ends meet and certainly cannot offer high wages or health care benefits to their workers.
“There’s just no extra income,” Sombke said. “And, in South Dakota, we’re a right-to-work state, so you can get fired for any reason. As a worker, you really don’t have a lot of choice.”
Hall, of the Fairness Project, said amending the constitution is the most effective way to expand Medicaid in states where conservative-leaning lawmakers have been reluctant to do so. She said she suspects that voters in other states might pursue the constitutional amendment strategy if their state lawmakers try to roll back expansion.
“I do think that it’s possible that if we see these cuts move forward in D.C., and states are making highly unpopular choices to cut benefits for people, that we will see this issue back at the ballot box,” Hall said. “But for right now, I would say we’re seeing the power of constitutional amendments to protect benefits in action in real time.”

Pharmacy middlemen working in Ohio on behalf of huge health conglomerates have long claimed they keep down drug costs. But a report released last week calls that into question.
The Ohio Department of Medicaid had been burned in the past by the big middlemen. And pharmacies across the state for years had said their Medicaid reimbursements were so scant that it was hard to stay in business. So the Medicaid department in 2022 gave the big pharmacy benefit managers — or PBMs — the boot and created a new system of paying for drugs.
The result: Dispensing fees paid to pharmacies were boosted more than 1,200% on average — and the new setup still achieved savings of $140 million over a two-year period, according to a study done by Milliman, the Medicaid department’s actuarial firm. 
At the same time, the system managed to sign up nearly every pharmacy in the state, the report said. That makes medicine more accessible to Medicaid patients, who often lack access to reliable transportation.
“Bottom Line: The (new system) delivers on its goals of accountability, transparency, and fairness – While doing so at a significantly lower administrative overhead cost to taxpayers,” the Medicaid department said in a cover letter to lawmakers that accompanies the study.
The three biggest PBMs in the United States are each owned by one of the 15 largest companies — UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna-Express Scripts. The conglomerates own major insurers and myriad other health businesses, such as doctors’ offices and pharmacies.
Their pharmacy benefit managers work on behalf of those and competing insurers to facilitate drug transactions that run through their own and competing pharmacies. They decide which drugs are covered by insurance and which get preferential treatment.
Combined, the big-three PBMs control nearly 80% of the insured drug transactions in the United States. That gives them great leverage to negotiate huge rebates and fees from drugmakers and to impose opaque contracts on pharmacies.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The big PBMs have long claimed they use their size to squeeze savings from drugmakers and pharmacies that they pass along to the insurers they represent. The conglomerates that own them also say that strict firewalls stand between their business units to keep their middlemen from providing unfair advantages to insurers and pharmacies owned by the same corporation.
But there are widespread complaints that the PBMs’ dealings are far from transparent, making it impossible for outsiders to know whether they’re getting a good deal. In 2018, the Ohio Department of Medicaid learned that it wasn’t.
Independent and small-chain pharmacies across Ohio had been complaining that they were getting killed in the Medicaid program. The reimbursements and dispensing fees they got from CVS Caremark and OptumRx were so low that it was making it hard for them to stay in business, they said.
The Columbus Dispatch in 2018 undertook an investigation. It gathered confidential reimbursement data from dozens of pharmacies, compared them to Medicaid claims data and determined that the two PBMs were charging the state a lot more for drugs than they were paying the pharmacies that had bought and dispensed them.
That prompted the Department of Medicaid to get the PBMs to turn over all their data. It commissioned a study showing that in 2017 alone, the two PBMs servicing the program charged taxpayers $224 million more for drugs than they paid out to pharmacists.
Those and other revelations prompted Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to file several lawsuits against the PBMs on behalf of state agencies. In addition, state lawmakers in Ohio and elsewhere have passed a raft of laws aimed at reigning them in, and the Federal Trade Commission is investigating and suing the companies.
For its part, the Ohio Department of Medicaid fired CVS Caremark and OptumRx and devised its own PBM. 
Launched in October 2022, it unbundled the services that had been provided by the big PBMs to create transparency and ensure contractors weren’t imposing huge markups as they had in 2017. 
In the interest of keeping pharmacies whole, it also mandated a huge increase on dispensing fees paid to them — from an average of just 73 cents per prescription under the old system to $9 under the new one, the report said. Partly as a result of that, the Medicaid department was able to get almost every pharmacy in Ohio to join its network and thus maximize accessibility for recipients.
The single PBM “pharmacy network is the largest, most inclusive in-state pharmacy network ever, with over 99% of Ohio pharmacies contracted as in-network providers, the Medicaid department said. “In addition to standard retail pharmacies, Ohio Medicaid beneficiaries also have access to specialized compounding pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies, home delivery pharmacies, and specialty pharmacies. In total, over 2,600 unique pharmacy locations are contracted with (the single PBM), including nearly 250 accredited specialty pharmacies.” 
The Medicaid department also boasted that recipients enjoy “complete freedom of choice with respect to their pharmacy selection” because Gainwell, the company that runs its PBM, doesn’t own a pharmacy.  
Ohio attorney general and 38 others call on Congress to stop middlemen from owning pharmacies

CVS Caremark and OptumRx are part of giant health conglomerates that also own pharmacies. Yost and 38 other state attorneys general on Monday accused the conglomerates of using their middlemen to favor their own pharmacies over their competitors. In a letter, they called on Congress to prohibit the health care giants from owning both PBMs and pharmacies.
The Medicaid department said it avoided such conflicts under its new arrangement.
“Under the (former arrangement), members were often steered to PBM-owned or affiliated specialty pharmacies; today, members are provided their options and are free to select the pharmacy provider that best meets their needs,” the department said. 
In addition, the new, single PBM eliminated duplicative administrative costs. That measure saved $333 million over two years when compared to what they would have cost under the old system, according to models created by the Medicaid department’s actuaries.
If you deduct increased dispensing fees and other new expenses from those savings, the new system created net savings of $140 million over a two-year period, the actuaries said.
The new system “has delivered much needed accountability and price transparency for Ohio taxpayers and Ohio pharmacies, providing assurance that Ohio’s tax dollars are spent appropriately,” the Medicaid department said.

(Photo by Benjamin Rondel/Getty Images)The New Hampshire Senate has often trashed landfill bills. But with growing political attention to solid waste issues, including from the governor, advocates hope this year will be different.
An early test came Tuesday, when the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee heard one bill to pause new landfills in the state for three years and another that seeks to rewrite recently updated regulations that some say are far too weak. 
The bills — House Bill 171 and House Bill 707, respectively — complement one another in ways. Advocates say the state should need only one new landfill in the next century. They argue taking a pause on new development will allow the state time to consider issues like the ones raised in HB 707 related to siting landfills, as well as others like managing the “trash juice” several landfills have failed to handle properly, or addressing the fact that half the waste dumped in New Hampshire comes from out of state.
Both bills proved uncontroversial in the House, passing on the consent calendar, where lawmakers approve a host of committee recommendations on legislation all at once and without debate. Solid waste issues in the state have garnered bipartisan support, with bills being led by both Republicans and Democrats. 
“Landfills should be the last resort, and we only really need one in the next 100 years,” Rep. Kelley Potenza, a Rochester Republican leading HB 707, told committee members. “And let’s do it in a perfect place that’s got good soil, clay, and we can make it happen.”
In the backdrop of the legislative debates is a proposal for a new landfill that many — including Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte — have criticized for its close proximity to a pristine lake and state park. Casella Waste Systems, the Vermont company that has fought for years for the landfill in the northern town of Dalton, is now fighting the Department of Environmental Services in court over the agency’s recent denial of a solid waste permit application for the project. 
HB 707 seeks to address criticisms against the state’s updated landfill regulations, which went into effect in December. The body that gave the final green light to those changes, the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, had approved them even as some members were concerned they weren’t adequately protective. Lawmakers on the panel argued, though, that those issues were policy ones for the Legislature to decide. This bill aims to take up that mantle.
For one, it would establish stricter setback standards for new landfills from “any existing drinking water well, perennial river, lake, or coastal water of New Hampshire.” Landfills would have to be 1,500 feet from those waters or be set back far enough so that groundwater from the site would take more than five years to reach those waters in the event of a leak or failure. Whichever of those two setbacks is the greatest would be what is required of the site. 
Additionally, it would strengthen the state’s requirements for the hydraulic conductivity of the soil at the site of a landfill, a metric that helps describe how quickly contaminated water would move through the soil in the event of a leak or failure. Some types of earth, like sand or gravel, are more permeable than others, like clay.
This standard — which would require a hydraulic conductivity of 0.0001 centimeters per second or less — would apply to the natural soils 20 feet below the landfill and under leachate storage and transfer stations. The current standard is 0.001 centimeters per second or less for the natural soil of the landfill going down 5 feet in depth. (The lower the rate, the slower pollution would move through the soil.)
Or, in what critics have called a “loophole” in the current regulations, a landfill can import a 2-foot base of soil with a hydraulic conductivity of 0.0001 centimeters per second or less. The bill would eliminate that option, stating explicitly that “no amount of imported soil can overcome such deficiency” in the hydraulic conductivity of a site’s natural soil.
The bill would also require that applicants for new landfills and expansions to investigate the sediments and bedrock beneath and adjacent to the proposed site, “at least to the depth of any aquifers currently used to provide drinking water to residents.” 
Under the bill, landfills would be required to always have at least one person on site. It also directs the department to incorporate the Ford Act into its landfill permitting requirements, “specifically the provision limiting the construction or establishment of municipal solid waste landfills within 6 miles of certain smaller public airports.” 
Current law says the department “may” deny a permit if a person “fails to demonstrate sufficient reliability, expertise, integrity, and competence to operate a solid waste facility.” It may also deny a permit if a person or a company’s “officers, directors, partners, key employees or persons or business entities holding 10 percent or more of its equity or debt liability” were convicted or pleaded guilty or no contest to a felony within the past five years in state or federal court.
This bill would change that “may” to a “shall,” making it a requirement that the department reject permits under those conditions instead of an option.
The legislation would also make what advocates say is a key change to the statute governing the department’s rulemaking. Instead of simply saying the commissioner has the responsibility and authority to adopt rules, it adds that those rules “are necessary to protect the public health and the environment with an ample margin of safety relative to this chapter.”
Some lawmakers on the panel, as well as a representative of Waste Management, which intends to expand its Turnkey facility in Rochester, indicated they would like more clarity in the language of the bill about how broad its exemption for expanding landfills is.
Henry Veilleux, a lobbyist for Waste Management, said the standard for the 20 feet of undisturbed soil beneath the landfill “would be problematic” and could create issues for the landfill starting in 2028. If the bill was changed so the landfill was allowed to bring in other material to be compliant, “then it would be OK,” he said. 
He also raised issues with part of the bill that would strengthen existing references to storm events in permitting requirements to apply to 100-year storms “with a 50% margin of safety,” arguing the department’s current model makes more sense for the region.
Though he raised concerns about these provisions, Veilleux also told the committee members he had just spoken to Potenza, and that the bill did not intend to impact the Turnkey facility. 
Shaun Mulholland, Lebanon’s city planner, said he was concerned that parts of the bill would affect the city’s plans to excavate its unlined landfill “that is leaking into the ground” into a lined one. He said Waste Management had identified a number of those concerns, but also added that he felt it would be challenging for the city to find staff for a guard onsite 24/7, considering it already has “great difficulty in this labor market in hiring people just to work in the daytime at the landfill.” He suggested technology like sensors would be more appropriate and effective.
Michael Wimsatt, director of DES’ waste management division, defended the department’s rules at the hearing. He said those rules include a site-specific setback requirement, but critics reject that characterization. 
Wimsatt pointed to language that says landfills and associated infrastructure “shall be located only in areas where groundwater monitoring for release detection, characterization and remediation can be conducted prior to a release having an adverse impact on groundwater quality at the property line” and before it has “an adverse impact on a water supply.” It also requires the landfills are located so that releases “will be detected and assessed, and remediation initiated prior to contamination reaching any perennial water body.”
Current regulations also require more general setbacks of 200 feet from certain streams and 500 feet from other water bodies. 
Wayne Morrison, president of the North Country Alliance for Balanced Change, a citizen group that has advocated for more protective waste policies, called the provision Wimsatt cited “a motherhood statement.”
“We think it lacks the heat behind it,” he said. 
On DES’ argument that its current regulations are site specific, Potenza was blunt: “They aren’t.”
“That doesn’t give anyone any instruction,” Potenza said of the provisions, “and to be honest … it puts the state in a very precarious position, I believe, for lawsuits and everything like that, because it doesn’t have anything, literally, specific.”
Under the state’s regulations, “you can put a landfill anywhere in the state of New Hampshire right now, as long as you bring in some soil,” Potenza said. “Doesn’t matter what that … site is, as long as you’re 500 feet back.” She called the state’s rules the weakest in the world; when asked by a lawmaker if that was the case, Wimsatt said, “I don’t believe that for a moment.”
The conversation on landfill siting underscored the push for a pause on new landfills in the state. And it’s not just the direct neighbors of landfills who are affected, Morrison said.
“What I have found is it’s in everybody’s backyard,” he said. “New Hampshire’s a small state. If you mess up a water table, it doesn’t just affect Dalton, it affects all the surrounding towns.” 
He said the state has ample landfill capacity to buy it time to carefully consider how it wants to move forward with its solid waste management. 
“We have the time, and … I think we have the obligation to future generations of people in New Hampshire to step back, do the investigations, find best practices, think differently about what we’re doing,” Morrison said. “We have to live with these decisions for the next 100 years, and we have the time to fix them. Let’s try and get it right.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/landfillsenate-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 05:03:42.763763

As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.










Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug


“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.



To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.

“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.

“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.

In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-17 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT students’ visas revoked: As details emerge, fears escalate",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/17/ct-student-visas-revoked-details/,"Most students’ status terminations appear to be connected to a wide range of interactions with law enforcement, rather than campus protests.","Normally at this time of year, students at Connecticut colleges and universities are caught up in the stress of researching final papers and preparing for exams.
But in recent days, thousands of international students — who have come from far and wide to pursue degrees from the state’s renowned higher education institutions — have been consumed with fear of losing their permission to study in the United States.
Earlier this week, the University of Connecticut confirmed that 13 students — six undergrads, six graduate students and one person in a post-graduate professional program — had seen their visa status terminated by federal authorities. None had been given a reason why, a spokesperson for UConn said.
The Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges, which represents 14 independent schools including Yale University, Trinity College, Quinnipiac University and Wesleyan University, said visas had been terminated for more than 40 students at its member institutions.
Initially, when reports began to emerge late last month of student visa cancellations and legal status terminations at schools around the country, the effort appeared to be focused on students who had protested or voiced opinions in favor of Palestine or against the war in Gaza. President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order in January to “combat anti-semitism,” and the administration has stated its intent to “quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.” 
That no longer appears to be the only criteria.
CCIC President Jennifer Widness and lawyers who spoke to The Connecticut Mirror said the majority of the students whose statuses were being terminated were not involved in campus protests. Instead, the terminations appear to be connected to a wide range of interactions with law enforcement — many of which may not be deportable offenses, the lawyers said.
“This has been very painful on the students,” Dana Bucin, an immigration attorney and partner at the law firm Harris Beach Murtha, said. In recent days, Bucin said, she’s been contacted by about a dozen students, some from inside Connecticut and some from other states, all of whom have had their immigration status revoked.
“I can tell you this: Instead of focusing on finals and dissertations and graduations, now they have to figure out how to protect themselves from sudden arrest,” Bucin said. 
On the evening of April 8, a graduate student at UConn received a message in his inbox from the university’s office of International Student & Scholar Services, informing him that his immigration status had been terminated. 
The student, who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns for his immigration status, said he knew it was coming.
The student told the CT Mirror that he had been arrested once. In 2024, he’d had what he described as a “minor argument” with his ex-girlfriend while on the street, he said. It became physical, and a bystander called the police. He was arrested on a family violence charge, but the court referred him to counseling and the case was dismissed within a few months, according to both him and his lawyer. Court records confirm the case was dropped. 
The student — who was expecting to graduate in the fall of 2026 — said he knows of other students at UConn whose visas had been revoked. He said he’d formed a group on social media that included hundreds of students nationwide.
“ People are feeling panic. And some of them have already got their visas terminated, and some of them have the arrest records, and they are expecting that day to come,” he said. 
Chris Llinas, a criminal defense and immigration attorney in Connecticut, said a person’s visa status can be terminated only if that person is convicted of certain types of crime and sentenced to a year or more of prison time. 
“I’ve been in touch with many of the affected Connecticut students, and none of them have that,” Llinas said.
Llinas said he’s spoken to students who are in diversionary programs, who have had their cases dismissed after participating in diversionary programs (alternatives to prosecution and incarceration) or court supervision, and one who was found not guilty of a crime. 
Bucin said she’s spoken to students whose closest brush with a crime was a traffic violation.   
“ It sounds like it’s simply if there’s been any interaction with law enforcement whatsoever, even for a small traffic ticket, these people are being targeted for status revocation,” she said.
Most international students affiliated with Connecticut primary, secondary and higher education schools in March 2025 had come from India, China, Canada, South Korea and Nigeria. Indian students made up 33.41% of the total, with 5,934 students, followed by 4,468 students from China, 25.16%. Students from Canada were 4.14% of the total, while South Korea and Nigeria made 2.84% and 1.75% of the total, respectively.Connecticut has a total of 17,760 international students with F and M visas. F visas are for full-time students at academic institutions. M visas are for students in vocational programs.
Bucin described three avenues students could take if they’ve had their immigration status terminated. First, she said, they can appeal to have their F-1 visa reinstated, which they need to do within five months of termination.
Bucin noted that a student would have to apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is housed under the Department of Homeland Security — the same agency that terminated the student’s status. “It’s as if your judge is your prosecutor,” she said.  
Another avenue is to self-deport, since once a person’s status is revoked, they can legally be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and deported at any time. But Bucin said she didn’t like that option. 
“ I hold the legal opinion that these F-1 status revocations have been done illegally. So for you to voluntarily give up your tuition payments and your course of study and everything you’ve built here in this country, and just voluntarily depart … it just goes counter to my sense of justice,” she said. 
The third way, she said, is to file a lawsuit, either as an individual or a class action, in federal court.
Earlier this week, the law firm Kuck Baxter filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Northern Georgia against top officials in the Trump administration. The firm is now representing 150 students who have had their immigration status terminated.
On March 25, the American Association of University Professors filed a lawsuit against members of the Trump administration, in which they allege that the policy of deporting international students who have participated in protests supporting Palestine to be a violation of the First and Fifth Amendments.
One of the plaintiffs in the AAUP lawsuit is Aslı Bâli, a Yale Law School professor and president of the nonprofit Middle East Studies Association. The lawsuit claimed Bâli’s work is being disrupted by the policy and that she had received “a cascade of requests for advice and assistance from noncitizen students and colleagues who fear that they will be targeted for deportation based on their speech.” 
“Many of these individuals have deleted their social media profiles, removed online references to their involvement in campus groups that have supported Palestinian rights, and taken down previously public writing about Palestine,” the lawsuit read. “One noncitizen colleague is considering declining an offer to chair their department out of concern that they might be limited in what they could say or do in the role without making themselves a target for deportation.” 
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., has written to DHS and the State Department seeking more information about the visa revocations, according to a press advisory sent late Wednesday. Blumenthal and New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker are expected to provide more information on the letter at an event Thursday morning in New Haven.
Later in the day Thursday, AAUP is holding protests against the federal government’s actions toward universities at Yale University and UConn’s Storrs campus. 
Llinas said attorneys are still trying to decide the best course of action to address the status revocations. 
“There are good lawyers who care deeply about this, who are working hard to figure out the best possible way to approach this, to serve the F-1 student visa holders across the state who have been affected by this,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP_UConn_campus_2015-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-04-17 05:03:42.763763

(Submitted by Christine Persun)Lily stared at me with wide, worried eyes, trying to process every word I said as I explained the problem in her workbook. I slowed down and repeated myself. She hung on every word, desperate to keep up.
Lily had immigrated from China just two years earlier and had spent time traveling back and forth. She was an incredibly hard worker, still learning English, and, as a first-year teacher, I had no idea how to help her.
Five years later, Eugenio arrived in my classroom from El Salvador. In many ways, he reminded me of Lily—motivated, hardworking, and eager to please. But unlike Lily, he had just arrived in the country and didn’t speak a word of English.
This time, though, I was prepared. I gave him directions in my very limited Spanish. I used AI to generate translated notes and assignments. I created a Spanish-to-English math dictionary and kept it handy for him. I modified assignments that would help him learn the concepts and experience success. I was ready to do whatever it took to help him learn.
The difference? Experience.
By the time I had Eugenio in my class, I knew my curriculum and I knew how to meet individual student needs. I knew where to look to find resources. I knew which colleagues to go to for guidance and support. When I had Lily as a student, I was a brand-new teacher, fresh out of student teaching. I had completed my university’s teacher preparation program and learned from a supportive mentor, but I was unprepared for the realities of the classroom. I needed a preparation program that equipped me to help students like Lily and Eugenio from day one—not five years later.
Teacher preparation programs at the university level often train pre-service teachers through a theoretical lens rather than a practical one, leaving many feeling underprepared for the realities of the classroom. In Pennsylvania, these programs vary greatly in coursework requirements, meaning a teacher’s readiness depends as much on their training program as on their own abilities.

A publication from the William Penn Foundation found that in order for teachers to succeed, they require much more time and practice in the classroom than current pathways to teaching offer. What future educators need are training experiences that truly mirror the realities of the classroom.
This means rethinking how we prepare teachers. Education majors should begin their work in schools in the early years of university rather than postponing until their student teaching experience during their senior year, when they may realize that teaching is not for them. From early on in their bachelor’s programs, pre-service teachers should be learning hands-on in the classroom.
Integrating early and consistent field experiences into teacher preparation programs is essential. As noted by Carolyn Parker, director of graduate teacher education at American University’s School of Education, “Get them into the schools as early as you can and as often as you can.” This approach gives pre-service teachers the time they need to build meaningful relationships with students and communities, ensuring they are well-prepared for the realities of the classroom.
They should be completing experiences by observing classrooms and meeting with students. Coursework should center on realistic case studies with real students instead of abstract theories. While standardized tests like the Praxis have been shown to correlate with effective teaching in specific subjects—particularly those requiring deep content knowledge, such as elementary math and reading—clinical experiences and capstone portfolios offer a more comprehensive way for teacher candidates to demonstrate their effectiveness.
More realistic forms of assessment allow candidates to showcase their teaching abilities in real classroom settings, which provides a clearer picture of their preparedness for the challenges of teaching.
Structural changes in teacher preparation policies are also necessary. New teachers consistently cite student teaching as the most valuable part of their training, as it allows them to apply theory in real classrooms under the guidance of experienced mentors.
To maximize its impact, student teaching should last an entire year, not just one semester to ensure that teacher candidates will be able to manage classrooms effectively. Universities must move away from the traditional model which delays classroom experience until later in academic programs. Instead, education majors should begin experiencing classrooms immediately.
Further, licensure requirements should be revised to prioritize demonstrated teaching skills over standardized test scores, allowing for a more accurate assessment of a candidate’s ability to succeed in the classroom.
A stronger, more practical approach to teacher preparation would mean fewer new teachers struggling to support students like Lily – and more teachers entering the classroom equipped to provide students like Eugenio the help they need from day one.
If we want new teachers to succeed, we need to demand change in how they’re prepared. It’s time to prioritize hands-on experience over outdated theory—because when teachers are prepared, students thrive, and when students succeed, we all succeed.

(Getty Images)Each year, a number of bills aim to legislate medicine. These are attempts by lawmakers to regulate the treatment relationship between physicians and their patients, or to determine when treatments can and cannot be delivered. This is nothing new, but a concerning trend has emerged recently in New Hampshire: Some bills go beyond an attempt to legislate medicine by including provisions that also criminalize medicine. 
These tactics include language within bills that impose criminal or civil penalties for physicians who do not comply with specific mandates. This year, House Bill 10, House Bill 232, and House Bill 377 each include provisions that would impose penalties on physicians. 
While health care and the practice of medicine is not — and should not be — political, tactics that seek to criminalize medical care and aspects of the physician-patient relationship stem from shifting political headwinds. Criminalizing medicine distracts and shifts the focus away from the real issues. Facets of medical practice that are seen as hot-button issues are likely to garner debates, both scientific and ideological. Legislating and criminalizing medicine, though, will have a ripple effect that might be felt throughout the health care community in numerous ways. 
Criminalizing medicine is an irresponsible and inappropriate way to control and respond to these issues. 
As physicians, we dedicate our lives and our careers to our patients, typically spending over a decade in training. This includes four years of undergraduate education, four years of medical school, three to eight years of residency training (depending on the medical specialty), and potentially one to three years of subspecialty fellowship training. This training provides us with the medical knowledge necessary to treat the unique health care challenges of each of our patients. Legislating and criminalizing medicine in New Hampshire, however, would mean that our physicians would be practicing medicine with one hand tied behind their back. This would then increase the likelihood that a patient’s health care needs might not be adequately addressed. 
Such bills, even when well-meaning, offer a reductive and punitive approach to health care. Treating the health care needs of vulnerable populations requires physicians to combine evidence-based principals, experience, training, and patient preferences to provide individualized medical care for each of our patients. Health care decisions are not made in a vacuum, and bills that criminalize medicine compromise our ability to make these vital treatment decisions.
Bills that criminalize medical care could set a dangerous precedent and have a “chilling effect,” creating barriers to providing high quality medical care for New Hampshire’s physicians. In other states that have criminalized elements of medical practice, physicians may hesitate to provide care in emergencies due to fear of criminal penalties. This has led to patient deaths that otherwise may have been avoidable. As medical professionals, we need to be entrusted to provide the right care at the right time for patients who need it. 
While Granite Staters already are finding medical care to be hard to come by, criminalizing medicine would make it more difficult to attract and retain physicians and other medical professionals to New Hampshire. This would in turn make it more difficult for patients to get appointments for primary care and specialist care. Bills that remove physician autonomy to care for our patients and penalize them for using their skills and training will have the unintended consequence of pushing physicians out of the state and exacerbating our shortage of physicians — especially in the most rural areas of the state.
Criminalizing the practice of medicine would not just fail our state’s physicians, but it would also fail all of our patients. This would set a dangerous precedent in New Hampshire and put the government in the middle of the relationship between physicians and their patients.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mergerdartmouth-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-04-17 05:03:42.763763

The Ohio House’s version of the two-year state budget only acknowledge two sexes, male and female, excluding transgender people and intersex people born with a mix of chromosomes or just one chromosome.
“It is the policy of the state of Ohio to recognize two sexes, male and female,” according to language from the House budget. “These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.”
The budget passed last week with a 60-39 vote and it now moves to the Ohio Senate. Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine must sign a budget by June 30. He has line-item veto power, so he can remove the gender limitation.

Adding the language to the budget is reckless, said Equality Ohio Executive Director Dwayne Steward. 
“The budget is not the place where we should be discussing culture war or legislating against people’s rights,” Steward said. “Instead of focusing on what’s important, like funding our schools and making sure kids have access to quality healthcare, they have decided a small percentage of the population should be attacked.”
The language in the House budget is similar to President Donald Trump’s executive order earlier this year saying the U.S. government will only recognize two sexes. 
“These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,” it says. “Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.”
Ohio’s legislators are trying to be in lockstep with the Trump administration, Steward said. 
“It’s almost verbatim from the executive order,” said Dara Adkison, executive director of TransOhio. “We know that there is an intentional effort to make it very difficult for trans people to exist in public spaces.”
The language in the House budget disregards intersex people who are born with variations in their sex characteristics that do not fit the typical binary definitions of male or female. 
“People who are intersex have genitals, chromosomes or reproductive organs that don’t fit into a male/female sex binary,” explains the Cleveland Clinic. “People who are intersex may have a mix of chromosomes, such as XXY. Or they may have some cells that are XY and some cells that are XX. Or they may have just one X chromosome (XO).”
It is estimated that up to 1.7% of the population has an intersex trait, according to the Center for American Progress. 
“The invalidation of all of those Ohioans as part of the budget is ridiculous,” Adkison said. 
The intersex community deserves to be recognized, Steward said. 
“They do exist,” he said. “You can’t legislate people out of existence.” 
Half of all transgender and nonbinary young people in Ohio who participated in a recent Trevor Project survey said they seriously considered suicide in the past year. Fifteen percent said they attempted suicide. 
This is according to the Trevor Project’s 2024 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Young People. The survey included about 700 people from Ohio, ages 13-24. 
Nearly three-fourths of transgender and nonbinary young people in Ohio reported feeling anxiety and 61% experienced depression, according to the survey. 
About 60% of transgender and nonbinary young people or their families have considered leaving Ohio because of anti-LGBTQ politics and law, according to the survey.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Every year, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost releases a report detailing the state of Ohio’s capital punishment system. This year, as with last year, it depicts an expensive and inefficient program. Yost argues serious reform is needed to drag it out of the ditch, but opponents contend the attorney general is misreading the facts in front of him.
They argue it’s time to scrap the death penalty in Ohio, not grasp for an end-run to restart executions.
Yost’s perspective
In the 2024 Capital Crimes report, Yost notes the average time death row inmates spend waiting for execution has grown to 22 years. At this point they’re more likely to die by suicide or natural causes than state corrections officials carrying out the sentence.
Throughout, Yost heaps scorn on Ohio’s approach to the death penalty. He describes it as a “ponderous machine” that is “essentially paralyzed” capable of producing “churn, waste and endless lawsuits — and little else.”
“This system satisfies nobody,” Yost argues. “Those who oppose the death penalty want it abolished altogether. Those who support the death penalty want it to be fair, timely and effective. Neither side is getting what it wants.”
Ohio AG Yost continues to back capital punishment despite system’s shortcomings

The report takes swipes at the way exonerations are discussed and the role of pharmaceutical companies. Defendants acquitted at retrial for lack of evidence or a prosecutor’s dismissal haven’t been proven innocent, Yost insists. “To state it plainly, guilty people sometimes beat the rap.” And pharmaceutical companies refusing to sell the state drugs used in lethal injection are “imped(ing) the laws of our nation,” according to Yost.
Yost’s solution for this self-described “stalemate” is to work with the U.S. Department of Justice to secure the necessary drugs or for state lawmakers to approve legislation allowing execution with nitrogen gas.
“There are two paths available to Ohio to enforce the laws on our books,” Yost states. “Pick one.”
Opponents’ view
Yost’s description of the capital punishment system’s shortcomings was so strong that Ohioans to Stop Executions quoted him to begin their own report.
Capital punishment “burns enormous amounts of effort, time and money, all to no purpose,” Yost stated. “It is a system that fails to deliver on the promise of justice for victims and their families, while wasting millions of taxpayer dollars.”
With that in mind, the organization contends, it’s time for Ohio to cut its losses and find a better solution.
“It’s time for Ohio to stop spending millions of dollars to prop up this broken system,” Ohioans to Stop Executions Executive Director Kevin Werner argued. “Repealing the death penalty is not just fiscally responsible, it is a moral and practical necessity.”
Alongside Werner, two people whose loved ones were murdered argued the death penalty is the wrong consequence. Sister Joanne Gross of the Ursuline Sisters of Cleveland described how a member of her order, Sister Joanne Marie Mascha, was raped and murdered 30 years ago.
“Despite our public opposition to the death penalty, the prosecutors were not deterred and pursued death anyway,” she explained. “Only a jury’s mistake on the verdict forms resulted in the young man not facing the death penalty at sentencing, which was an answer to our prayers.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Late last year the man convicted of murdering Mascha sent the sisters a letter, Gross said, “taking responsibility for his actions and seeking forgiveness.”
Rev. Jack Sullivan explained in 1997 he learned that his 21-year-old sister had been shot and killed in her home. He argued his family is one of many with “absolutely no confidence in the death penalty.”
“As we know, executions possess no life-restoring powers,” he said, “and offer no life honoring properties.”
Sullivan added, “Executions cannot mend broken heart(s) but only create more. They cannot heal grieving souls but only create more. And they cannot provide ever-elusive closure.”
Werner argued the state is at an impasse, and finding a new source for drugs or allowing executions with nitrogen gas won’t solve the system’s underlying problems. Those changes won’t make the legal process faster or cheaper, address wrongful convictions or provide support to victims’ families.
“It doesn’t fix a single problem,” Werner argued. “It feels a little bit more like a like a political thing, than it does good public policy that has outcomes that are both desired and needed.”

(Graham County Public Library)“An advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology alone.”
Let’s hear it for humanities!
In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act. The legislation combines technical information needed for a new law with aspirational language needed to describe its purpose: An advanced civilization, along with investing in science and technology, must also “give full value and support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.”
The legislation established the National Endowment for the Humanities, which was designed to keep Americans engaged and thinking about democracy and ideas. The work of state humanities councils — there is one in every state and territory, including Humanities Kansas — has been embraced by millions of Americans participating in activities like local preservation projects, community conversations, and local exhibits. This work has also been supported by every Congress for the last 60 years.
Until now.
On April 2, Humanities Kansas received a letter from the Department of Government Efficiency terminating the federal grant that carries out the intent of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act. This has significant implications for our state and nation.
Federal funds are appropriated by Congress to the National Endowment for the Humanities and then sent out to the state humanities councils, like Humanities Kansas, that are charged with distributing the funds across their state. It’s a process that works.
Why would the United States government have responsibility to fund projects that explore history and literature and support community treasures like museums and libraries? Because, as the Act explains, democracy depends on the exchange of ideas.
The creation and passage of the 1965 Arts and Humanities Act did not occur in a vacuum, writes historian Jason Steinhauer in a recent History Club commentary.
The space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, the growth and popularity of television, and a cultural focus on technological advancement led a group of passionate Americans to convince members of Congress from both parties that our position in the world — and our very democracy — would be threatened without a serious investment in strengthening civic engagement through arts and humanities.
“Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens,” the legislation states. “It must therefore foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and the humanities, designed to make people of all backgrounds and wherever located masters of their technology and not its unthinking servants.”
That statement, and the entire act, is as relevant today as it was then.
My colleague Adam Davis, executive director of Oregon Humanities, shared in a recent podcast how the state humanities councils do this work: “Person by person, room by room, community by community.”
This is true in Kansas, too.

Last year, Humanities Kansas, using federal funds designated to us, supported 488 events in 126 communities. The events are local — person by person, community by community. The Cherryvale Museum volunteers sat down and interviewed local Vietnam War veterans. The Republic County Historical Museum worked with filmmakers to tell the story of a once thriving town named Minersville, now long gone, built on Kansas’s lignite coal industry.
Historians partnered with Humanities Kansas to create a special speakers bureau to explore the legacy of the 1954 landmark Supreme Court case, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka on its 70th anniversary. Four speakers were invited to speak 32 times in 25 different Kansas communities over the course of a year. And free tickets to the U.S. Poet Laureate’s appearance in Salina, as part of an event created by Humanities Kansas, the Salina Art Center, and Salina Arts and Humanities, sold out in 22 minutes. Kansans love the humanities. Demand for humanities resources continue to rise.
Kansans and Kansas organizations turn to Humanities Kansas because they’re looking for something — a financial boost to get a project to the finish line, inspiration from talented authors and thinkers, a chance to connect with others. And Kansans connect with the humanities in ways that make sense to them. It might be through attending local history presentations, poetry hikes, oral histories, book discussions, film festivals, exhibitions and community festivals. It might be collecting recipes from family members passed down by our grandparents or learning about heirloom gardens and growing heritage tomatoes.
These are all activities rooted in stories — stories of our families, our communities, and our nation. These are stories that connect people to place and show us what we, as Kansans and Americans, have valued over time and across generations. They show us what it means to be part of a democracy.
Kansans are engaging with democracy through humanities programming created by and for the local community with a boost, when needed, by Humanities Kansas. At events that are free and open to the public, we see communities invested in civic engagement: “What would happen if you shared your idea, and I shared my idea and then together we came up with an even better idea?”
Isn’t that what we all want? Something better? For our communities and our nation? It’s a movement of ideas. It’s how we strengthen our democracy and honor our country. It’s how we move forward. It’s what the 1965 law intended.
Let’s make sure our Kansas stories — community by community — are preserved.

Feeling tariff whiplash? You’re not alone. On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs – a 10% levy on nearly all U.S. imports, along with targeted duties aimed at punishing countries he accuses of exploiting American markets. Just a week later, on April 9, his administration abruptly paused much of the plan for 90 days, leaving markets and allies scrambling for clarity.
The proposed tariffs were pitched as a way to revive U.S. manufacturing, reclaim jobs and counter what Trump considers unfair trade practices. But they immediately rattled the financial markets and raised alarms among economists and America’s global partners. Critics across the political spectrum revived a familiar warning: “beggar-thy-neighbor.”
History shows that such policies rarely succeed. In today’s interconnected world, they’re more likely to provoke swift, precise and painful retaliation.
 What is the ‘beggar-thy-neighbor’ strategy?

The phrase comes from economic history and refers to protectionist measures – tariffs, import restrictions or currency manipulation – designed to boost one country’s economy at the expense of its trading partners. Think of it like cleaning your yard by dumping the trash into your neighbor’s property: It looks tidy on your side until they respond.
This approach starkly contrasts with the principles laid out by Adam Smith. In “The Wealth of Nations,” he argued that trade is not a zero-sum game. Specialization and open markets, he observed, create mutual benefit – a rising tide that lifts all boats. Trump’s tariffs disregard this logic.
And history backs Smith. In the 1930s, the U.S. adopted a similar strategy to the one Trump is experimenting with through the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, raising duties to protect domestic jobs. The result was a wave of global retaliation that choked international trade and worsened the Great Depression.
 A case in point: Lesotho

As an example, consider the 50% tariff the United States imposed on imports from Lesotho, a small landlocked African nation. The measure took effect at midnight on April 3 but was reportedly subject to the 90-day pause starting midday April 4.
The tariff rate was calculated by taking the U.S. trade deficit with Lesotho – US$234.5 million in 2024 – dividing that by the total value of Lesotho’s exports to the U.S., or $237.3 million, and dividing that by two.
The 50% tariff would have a negligible effect on the U.S. economy – after all, out of the $3.3 trillion the U.S. imported in 2024, only a tiny fraction came from Lesotho. But for Lesotho, a nation that relies heavily on garment exports and preferential U.S. market access, the consequences would be severe. Using the same tariff logic across all partners, big or small, overlooks basic economic realities: differences in scale, trade capacity and vulnerability. It epitomizes beggar-thy-neighbor thinking: offloading domestic frustrations onto weaker economies for short-term political optics.
Lesotho is just one example. Even countries that import more from the U.S. than they export, such as Australia and the U.K., haven’t been spared. This “scoreboard” mentality – treating trade deficits as losses and surpluses as wins – risks reducing the complexity of global commerce to a tit-for-tat game.
 The return of a familiar — and risky — playbook

Such thinking has consequences. During Trump’s first term, China retaliated against U.S. tariffs by slashing imports of American soybeans and pork. As a result, those exports plummeted from $14 billion in 2017 to just $3 billion in 2018, hitting politically sensitive states like Iowa hard. The European Union responded to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs by threatening to target bourbon from Kentucky and motorcycles from Wisconsin – iconic products from the home states of former GOP leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan. Canada and the European Union have shown a willingness to use similar tactics this time around.
This isn’t new. In 2002, President George W. Bush imposed tariffs of up to 30% on imported steel, prompting the European Union to threaten retaliatory tariffs targeting products such as Florida citrus and Carolina textiles made in key swing states. Facing domestic political pressure and a World Trade Organization ruling against the measure, Bush reversed course within 21 months.
A decade earlier, the Clinton administration endured a long-running trade dispute with the EU known as the “banana wars,” in which European regulators structured import rules that disadvantaged U.S.-backed Latin American banana exporters in favor of former European colonies.
During the Obama years, the U.S. increased visa fees that disproportionately impacted India’s technology services sector. India responded by delaying approvals for American drugmakers and large retail investments.
Not all forms of trade retaliation grab headlines. Many are subtle, slow and bureaucratic – but no less damaging. Customs officials can delay paperwork or may impose arbitrary inspection or labeling requirements. Approval for U.S. pharmaceuticals, tech products or chemicals can be stalled for vague procedural reasons. Public procurement rules can be quietly rewritten to exclude U.S. companies.
While these tactics rarely draw public attention, their cumulative cost is real: missed delivery deadlines, lost contracts and rising operational costs. Over time, American businesses may shift operations abroad – not because of labor costs or regulation at home, but to escape the slow drip of bureaucratic punishment they experience elsewhere.
 Tariffs in a connected economy

Supporters of tariffs often argue that they protect domestic industries and create jobs. In theory, they might. But in practice, recent history shows they are more likely to invite retaliation, raise prices and disrupt supply chains.
Modern manufacturing is deeply interconnected. A product may involve assembling components from a dozen countries, moving back and forth across borders. Tariffs hurt foreign suppliers and American manufacturers, workers and consumers.
More strategically damaging, they erode U.S. influence. Allies grow weary of unpredictable trade moves, and rivals, including China and Russia, step in to forge deeper partnerships. Countries may reduce their exposure to the U.S. dollar, sell off Treasury bonds, or align with regional blocs like the BRICS group – led by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – not out of ideology, but necessity.
In short, the U.S. weakens its own strategic hand. The long-term cost isn’t just economic – it’s geopolitical.
Rather than resorting to beggar-thy-neighbor tactics, the U.S. could secure its future by investing in what truly drives long-term strength: smart workforce development, breakthrough innovation  and savvy partnerships with allies. This approach would tackle trade imbalances through skillful diplomacy instead of brute force, while building resilience at home by equipping American workers and companies to thrive – not by scapegoating others.
History makes a clear case: Ditching the obsession with bilateral trade deficits and focusing instead on value creation pays off. The U.S. can source components from around the world and elevate them through unmatched design, innovation and manufacturing excellence. That’s the heartbeat of real economic might.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
Black colleges ponder their future as Trump makes cuts to education dollars

The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

 DEI-related cuts

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Tribes, Native students sue feds over education cuts

Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
 Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
 Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.










There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher


Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Stock photo by IronHeart/Getty Images)In 2016, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and its Division of Behavioral Health, as a part of its strategic plan, identified the need to study of the costs associated with providing mental health and substance use disorder services.
Agency leaders believed the findings of this study would help them ensure “statewide capacity and access to behavioral health services.”
That cost modeling, which looked at behavioral health services, identified state reimbursement rates far below the costs associated with providing care. Many services were receiving 7% to 35% below actual costs.
The Nebraska Legislature and Appropriations Committee Chairman John Stinner and Vice Chair Kate Bolz led needed efforts to increase rates. This, in turn, allowed providers to expand and improve access to care and take steps to maintain and expand workforce.
Funding priorities
Unfortunately, too many people still cannot afford access to mental health care, and that is why the Legislature should continue making behavioral health care a priority. Medicaid is one of the primary payers for mental health and substance use disorder services, resulting in many of our community providers relying on those rates for a high percentage of their revenues.
Providers are paid for their services through a managed
care system in which the state contracts with insurance companies, which then negotiate reimbursement rates with providers.
The Legislature appropriates funds for the Medicaid program, which includes provider rates. Each July, after the start of a new fiscal year, the Medicaid division posts the legislatively approved rates.
These rates are what managed care companies use when negotiating contracts with providers. But uncertain times have providers worried about maintaining their services and meeting the needs of their clients. So they need to know that the rates appropriated by the Legislature will be the minimum rate they receive.
Potential changes
One way to do this is Legislative Bill 380, a proposal from State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha aimed at tightening up managed care and provider audit statutes.
The bill establishes that posted rates will be the floor for rates paid to providers. Knowing that they won’t be paid less than what the Legislature budgets gives providers, who are business people, too, some assurances for maintaining and growing their workforce.
Businesses require such certainty to add services and meet people where they live. Addressing this planning issue is critical to ensuring that the progress Nebraska mental health and substance use disorder providers have made is not jeopardized.
Statistics around mental illness and substance use disorders are still disturbing. In Nebraska, suicide is the second-leading cause of death for 10- to 24-year-olds and 25- to 34-year-olds. We have four times more deaths by suicide than car accidents.
One in six youth ages 6 to 17, and one in three young adults ages 18 to 25, struggle with a mental illness. Yet we know that many people do not receive the care they need for these treatable illnesses.
We must continue building a strong, more resilient system of care that improves access and helps us, as a state, to keep moving the trends involving mental health in the right direction.
Annette Dubas was the first executive director for the Nebraska Association of Behavioral Health Organizations (NABHO). She began that role after serving eight years as a state senator.

John McCosh/Georgia Recorder“It’s our mission to enhance your college experience through the internationalization of campus,” the University of Georgia tells its 2,600 foreign students on its website. “No matter your held identity, perspective and worldview, there’s a place for everyone.”
Except, there’s not a place for everyone. 
Not anymore.
All around the country, including here in Georgia, hundreds and most likely thousands of foreign students are being stripped of their student visas for little or no apparent reason, and are told to either deport themselves immediately or be arrested and deported by force. 
Agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, under pressure to meet deportation quotas, have found those students to be easy pickings. They’re simple to find – their names and addresses are already in a federal database – and ICE agents are apparently sifting through that database, trying to find any reason, plausible or implausible, to evict people.
In some cases, students are being targeted for voicing support for Palestinians, not necessarily in protests but on social media and other outlets as well. One student in Vermont, a 10-year U.S. resident with a green card, was arrested for deportation at an interview that he scheduled as part of his process to become an American citizen, and we still don’t know the reason. Others have been ordered to leave the country immediately based on years-old traffic tickets or dropped misdemeanor charges, and some based on no apparent reason at all. 
Lawsuits have been filed in federal courts here in Georgia and elsewhere, attempting to force the government to justify its actions, but the outcome of those suits is uncertain. The fact that there’s so little rhyme or reason to the deportation orders, which come with no warning, makes them even more frightening and dangerous. These aren’t terrorists or criminals who are being targeted. They are people who came here legally, through the process, and the random nature of their attempted removal makes the message clear: 
Immigrants, get out.
The impact here in Georgia can be significant. Emory University hosts roughly 3,300 foreign undergraduates and more than 1,000 post-graduate students and scholars, many in the medical field. Kennesaw State enrolls more than 1,600 international students, and Georgia State has more than twice that number.
Not surprisingly, Georgia Tech hosts the largest contingent of international students in the state. In addition to more than 1,600 undergraduate students, Tech has attracted almost 12,000 post-graduate students to its campus, representing the best and the brightest of more than 100 countries. They make up more than a third of Tech’s post-grad student body.
Those students and the often-cutting-edge research they conduct have in turn helped to attract venture capital, startups and incubators to Georgia Tech’s Technology Square in midtown Atlanta. Companies such as NCR, Boeing and others have invested more than $1 billion in projects at Tech Square, which according to Georgia Tech has “the highest density of startups, corporate innovators, academic researchers, and students in the entire southeastern United States,” with “over 100 startups, 5 startup accelerators, 25 corporate innovation centers, 7 venture funds, 10 research labs, 10 Top 10 engineering programs (and) one Top 10 MBA program.”
These are, or ought to be, the foundations upon which a modern, prosperous economy are built. In fact, according to one study, “21 of the 87 privately held U.S. companies valued at $1 billion or more had a founder who first came to the United States as an international student.” 
Yet we’re in the process of running them off.
In addition, foreign students are a big revenue generator for many schools, because they generally are able and willing to pay full tuition, in effect subsidizing their U.S. classmates. If the flow of international students and revenue is shut down, as seems likely, some smaller private schools may even be forced to close. Overall, higher education is an American specialty, an “industry” renowned around the world for its quality, and we’re locking the doors to incoming customers. 
The impact of these deportation attempts goes well beyond those individuals being targeted for removal. Word has already spread overseas, where these evictions are creating a climate of fear and distrust that will last generations. To make things even worse, the Trump regime is also attempting to slash funding for American scholars who want to study and do research overseas, through programs such as the Fulbright. 
What supposedly began as a concern about illegal immigration has grown into something much uglier and destructive. We are shutting ourselves off from the rest of the world. We are telling them we don’t want their business, we don’t want their friendship, we don’t want them.
It’s just crazy what we’re doing to ourselves.

In 2021, leveraging American Rescue Plan funding, the USDA distributed $1 billion in grants to states, enabling school districts, food banks, and distribution hubs nationwide to purchase produce, meat, dairy, and other minimally processed foods directly from over 8,000 local farmers. These programs essentially provided small, diversified farms with direct market access to community institutions.
The LFPA and LFSP initiatives not only fortified regional supply chains and fostered crucial stakeholder partnerships, but also improved the health and well-being of all students and food insecure families. Furthermore, they injected vital financial capital into small farming enterprises. 
This nationwide investment of hundreds of millions of dollars yielded significant positive outcomes for community health and local food economies, reflecting a strategically sound policy approach. Recognizing the programs’ success, President Biden allocated $1.1 billion in late 2024 to extend their reach and continue to build resiliency within local food systems. Farmers, school food service directors, and food banks, having established strong connections with food hubs, eagerly anticipated this continuation, with farmers already having invested in seeds and planting.
State agencies nationwide, including those in Connecticut, received notification on March 7, that the $1.1 billion second funding round for the LFPA and LFSP programs had been terminated due to a shift in priorities and cost-saving efforts, diverging from the previous administration’s objectives.
“Let’s be clear,” said Renee Giroux, farmer and founder of the Northwest Connecticut Food Hub, who spoke on behalf of small Connecticut farmers at the press conference, “This isn’t just about numbers. It’s about real people, real farms, and real families. At a time when food insecurity is rising and local farms are struggling to survive, we should be strengthening programs like LFPA and LFSP, not cutting them. Local food production and direct distribution to the local community is good for our health, economy and environment.”
The cancellation’s repercussions for Connecticut are significant: $9.3 million that would have continued to strengthen local agriculture, student resources, and food security initiatives, will no longer be available.
Let’s break down the numbers:
The Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA) aimed to connect Connecticut farms directly with food pantries. From 2023 to 2025, the CT Department of Agriculture received $6.7 million from the USDA for this initiative, and expected an additional $3.7 million. 
CT Foodshare, a key partner, received $3 million initially and was slated to receive an additional $1 million before the program’s cancellation. This funding enabled them to supply fresh produce from local farms to pantries statewide. 
“The loss of this funding is immense,” a spokesperson for Connecticut Foodshare said, “and it has a direct impact on both the people we serve as well as our local farm partners. The program would have enabled us to provide millions of fresh, Connecticut-grown meals to the one in eight Connecticut residents (including one in six children) experiencing food insecurity.”
The Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program (LFSP), designed to bring local farm products to schools, provided the Connecticut Department of Education with $1.873 million from the USDA between 2022 and 2025. Prior to its cancellation, an additional $5.6 million was planned. This second round of funding included $4.6 million for K-12 schools and $1 million for early childhood education centers. 
Ashley Carl, Director of Food and Nutrition Services in Plainville states, “The funding from LFSP has been essential in allowing us to provide students with locally sourced foods. Without this support, maintaining the diverse range of local offerings on our limited budget would be an enormous challenge.”
We have to ask ourselves, what could possibly be a higher priority than ensuring students and those facing food insecurity have access to nutritious food, while simultaneously supporting the economic health of Connecticut’s small farms?
As local leaders, deeply invested in a just, regenerative and resilient food system, we ask for your help. Contact your federal representatives immediately. Urge them to demand that the USDA reinstate funding for the Local Food Purchase Assistance Program (LFPA) and the Local Food for Schools Program (LFSP).
Contact your district’s delegation immediately. Urge them to support H.B. 7013, “An Act Concerning Enhancements To The Local Food For Schools Incentive Program And The CT Grown For CT Kids Grant Program,” currently under consideration. This bill strengthens our state’s local food incentive program and ensures continued funding for farm-to-school initiatives through the CT Grown for CT Kids Grant Program. These programs are proven to work. Please support them.

Unfortunately, instead of properly funding towns, the Democratic majority has once again relied on budgetary gimmicks —not to improve education, but to circumvent their own fiscal rules.
For years, Democratic leadership has put Connecticut’s municipalities at the bottom of the priority list. Their spending formula is clear: state employees and their benefits come first, then the massive entitlement bureaucracy that supports them. Only after that do they consider municipal aid. The result is skyrocketing property taxes as towns are forced to make up for the state’s shortfalls.
I have always prioritized municipal aid because funding towns properly reduces the pressure to raise property taxes, something Connecticut desperately needs. That’s why I supported the original $40 million special-education funding bill when it passed unanimously earlier this year. Then, Gov. Ned Lamont inexplicably vetoed it. 

State Sen. Rob Sampson
Normally, this would lead to an easy override vote. Instead, Democrats saw an opportunity to sidestep their own spending caps and funneled the same $40 million into an off-the-books account using “emergency certification”—a process that bypasses public hearings and committee review, leaving taxpayers in the dark.
There was no reason to avoid a transparent process other than to evade Connecticut’s bipartisan fiscal guardrails —rules designed to protect taxpayers from reckless spending. These same Democrats had unanimously supported these budget guardrails (also known as spending caps) in early 2023 at the urging of legislative Republicans. Governor Lamont himself recently called them “sacrosanct.” However, when following them became inconvenient, they chose to ignore them.
If their goal had been to truly help students, they would have had a better option. Republicans responded to this maneuver by proposing an amendment to more than double the funding —offering $92.2 million for special education within the budget guardrails. Every Democrat voted that amendment down —making it less about funding schools and more about bending financial rules to fit their agenda.
At the same time, Democrats approved another bill that funnels $3 million to politically connected advocacy groups, including organizations focused on illegal immigration and gender-affirming care. 
Among the recipients were: Planned Parenthood, which received $800,000 despite having over $2.5 billion in assets; Hartford Gay and Lesbian Health Collective, which received $387,500; New Haven Gay and Lesbian Community Center, which received $225,000; Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services, which received $225,000; Junta for Progressive Action, which received $62,500; and Anchor Health Initiative, which received $62,500. These organizations were hand-picked with no public vetting and there will be nearly zero oversight on how these taxpayer dollars are spent.
Meanwhile, Connecticut families struggle with affordability. Electric rates remain artificially high due to the public benefits charge, which Republicans are fighting to remove. Property taxes are among the highest in the nation, yet towns are forced to beg for funding while millions go to well-connected special interest groups.
To put this in perspective, I offered an amendment redirecting this $3 million toward Meals on Wheels for seniors and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program—funding that would help those most in need. Democrats voted it down on party lines.
What happened in the legislature weeks ago wasn’t just fiscal irresponsibility; it was a blatant display of misplaced priorities.
Special education funding should be managed transparently and responsibly. Instead, Democrats exploited it to undermine Connecticut’s hard-fought budget stability while simultaneously directing taxpayer money to ideological groups with no accountability.
If we want a government that serves the people, we must hold lawmakers accountable for following the budget rules they themselves voted into law. We need to properly fund municipal aid to reduce property tax burdens. We must stop politically motivated spending and focus on real affordability solutions.
I will continue fighting for responsible budgeting, protecting taxpayers, and demanding transparency. If the majority refuses to put Connecticut residents first, then it is up to the public to demand better.

Connecticut leads the charge in the fight to preserve the American rule of law. Whether native to Hartford or Peru, our elected officials have answered the call to sustain our democracy. In Washington, D.C., U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy’s fervent advocacy is meticulous. Laying out a comprehensive timeline of an unprecedented incidence of corruption, Murphy is a bulwark on the senate floor. Sen. Richard Blumenthal has lucidly tracked critical votes and federal developments, keeping Connecticut in the know amidst unprecedented change.
Speaking at a town hall in Greenwich, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, fellow first-generation, Connecticut-native, and U.S. House Representative Jim Himes went directly to the people. As attorneys general across the nation prepare for extensive legal battles, Tong emphasized the importance of checks, balances and our own civic participation at the local level. As I contemplated writing these very words, Rep. Jim Himes called me into a telephonic town hall with my neighbors. Their message is resoundingly clear: Do not despair. Organize.
I am proud to see our elected officials on the frontlines of this fight. Their efforts, however, should offer us no comfort. Dr. Martin Luther King was arrested for standing up for his beliefs. Writing a letter to generations to come from a jail cell in Birmingham, Dr. King expressed profound disappointment in the moderate “who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action’.” 
We voted for leaders who we believed would stand up for Connecticut. In so doing, we do not cast aside our own responsibility to do the same.
The Constitution State was present for the birth of American democracy. As a second year Harvard law student, I write home to plead that we continue to sustain the same American values and ideals that I grew up believing in. We live in overwhelming times, but it is not in our nature to sit idle. I am grateful to our senators, our attorney general, my own congressional representative for their example to us. 
But we all have a role to play. Whether its standing on principle as a corporate law firm, making the tough editorial decisions to ensure the free press remain free, or even donating your time or money to local causes, there is still work to be done. Don’t despair. Organize.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)With Utah public universities preparing to make cuts on what may be considered low-performing programs to comply with a new state law, different institutions are quickly making plans to merge colleges, and to lay off some of their staff.
This year the Utah Legislature approved HB265, giving instructions to the Utah Board of Higher Education to cut 10% of budgets for courses and switch that funding from “underperforming programs” to degrees that may have waitlists. That left universities scrambling to meet the state-imposed deadlines starting with a first draft of the plans due on May 9 to the Utah Board of Higher Education. 
While that’s the initial deadline, the schools have three years to implement their plans in order to receive the ongoing total of $60 million retained by the state in a “strategic reinvestment account” meant to be spent on high-demand programs. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Salt Lake Community College, which has to cut $5.2 million to invest in other areas, is gathering leaders at the institution to evaluate their instructional budget considering factors such as completion time, outcomes and workforce demand, said Jason Pickavance, interim provost for the office of Academic Affairs at the college.
Budget bills targeting ‘underperforming’ university programs press forward

Reallocations within schools weren’t invented with the bill, Pickavance said. They are a routine exercise the college goes through to update its curriculum and keep up with what’s needed in the workforce. Already having a system in place is what may make this process even more challenging, he added, since programs have already been streamlined. 
“One of the things I’ve done to make the exercise more achievable is I’ve extended it to non-instructional areas of Academic Affairs,” Pickavance said. Those areas include a curriculum office, testing services, a library and an e-learning office. “One of the charges to the deans and the associate provosts is to consider not just looking at instruction, but thinking about how they might consolidate staff or administration in their area.”
That means that as part of the reallocation process, there could be layoffs to decrease the number of academic administrators — which include associate deans, directors, deans and associate provosts. Other staff lines would also be consolidated.
As for programs, that’s still under consideration since their effectiveness evaluation is more nuanced than simple enrollment and graduation metrics. 
SLCC’s dental hygiene program, for example, is a small program that admits about 25 students per cohort, he said. But that’s partly because there’s a fixed number of stations where instructors can teach. So, that program, despite its demand and success won’t be getting larger anytime soon. 
“They graduate every one of those students, and every one of those students goes and gets a job,” Pickavance said. “So that program, to me, is a very small, but high performing program.”
But programs like, say, psychology, which has hundreds of students a year, don’t have those kinds of equipment constraints and are designed to transfer students to other institutions, and not necessarily to get them directly in the workforce. 
“The technical challenges we came up with as we were thinking about ‘how do we want to evaluate programs?’ is that programs are very varied in their purpose and in their scope,” he said. “And you really want to think about is a program accomplishing what it’s intending to accomplish, not holding a program to some rigid one-size-fits-all metric.”
So far, it has been an anxiety-inducing process, Pickavance said. While the college is working hard to be responsive and agile while managing taxpayer dollars, they are also trying to approach this from a humane perspective.
“We’re talking about staff or faculty, and I expect there will be some people that we have to let go,” he said. “I hope it’s minimal, and I hope that we’re really thinking carefully about, if we do have to discontinue, is there another spot in the college that we can find a space for them?”
USU is merging colleges and cutting staff
Utah State University, which must cut $12.5 million as part of the state’s reallocation project, is making two college mergers. 
The first will combine the Caine College of the Arts, the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, and the College of Science, resulting in a new college “that aligns with common arts and sciences models nationally,” Alan Smith, interim president of USU said in an update. Joe Ward, the dean of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences is set to lead it.
The second will be a merger of the S.J. & Jessie E. Quinney College of Natural Resources and the College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences into a new school “that aligns with those found at several thriving land-grant institutions,” Smith wrote. A dean of this new college is still to be determined. 


Let us know what you think...


 

“The restructuring of these colleges will be accompanied by department consolidations, moves, and reconfigurations that strengthen alignment and cohesion,” Smith said. “These changes will likely impact downstream programs, initiatives, and centers or institutes.”
At the end of March, Smith wrote in another message that “there will be no way to avoid job cuts,” since personnel are the primary cost of the institution, offering faculty and staff to apply for a “voluntary separation incentive plan,” with cash incentives depending on age and years of service.  
Under the new bill the university may also adopt policies that supersede other institutional policies to reach the goals, Smith wrote. So, “existing policies tied to curricular changes, tenured roles, and other areas will not be applied when implementing our HB 265 plan.”
University of Utah bracing to cut $19 million, plus federal cuts
The University of Utah saw this coming, Mitzi Montoya, senior vice president for Academic Affairs, said in a newsletter. In early 2024, the Utah System of Higher Education received an ongoing 1.5% cut in its budgets beginning this summer and heard that more could come in 2025, so the university had already anticipated a 10% reduction.
To save the $19.7 million the U. has to reallocate, each academic unit will meet to develop plans before the initial draft deadline coming up in May, Montoya said in an Academic Senate meeting on April 7.
“We’re focusing particular support on working with the deans that have programs that might be flagged as lower enrollment,” Montoya said in the meeting. “The task is to work on developing explanations of the data, potentially growing enrollment, or making whatever changes may need to happen from a curricular standpoint.”
Audit: Could cutting low-performing college programs help Utah’s academic outlook? 

Programs that have fewer than 40 students enrolled are to be considered “low enrollment,” a benchmark also used by the Utah System of Higher Education.
Some of the low enrollment but high impact programs that may be affected by the reallocations are mining engineering, metallurgical engineering and geological engineering. 
“We are also using our data to build a picture of the contributions of our smaller programs,” Montoya wrote in the newsletter. “We can’t know what the outcome of this process will be, but we do know that we will continue to be committed to the full swath of disciplines that make an R1 institution such as ours strong and contribute to research advancement.”
One of the goals at the state’s flagship university is also to invest to support student growth, Montoya said in the meeting. She noted that some areas where lawmakers would like to see growth are accounting, data science and nursing, all highlighted in the audit that inspired HB265.
With looming federal cuts, the university is also bracing for changes in its research department, guiding researchers to move with urgency, and “aligning discovery with national priorities,” according to a message from Erin Rothwell, the U.’s vice president for Research.

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)A crowd of over 100 residents gathered in front of the Alaska State Capitol in Juneau on Wednesday, for a “pop-up” protest calling for due process and justice for a Maryland man mistakenly deported and imprisoned in El Salvador.  
“Protect the Constitution!” the crowd chanted, and demonstrators held hand-made signs reading: “Uphold the rule of law!” “Due process matters,” and “Bring Kilmar home.”
Outrage has grown across the country, with protests and town halls, around 30-year-old Kilmar Abrego Garcia — who was granted asylum in the U.S. due to threats of gang violence in 2019 — his mistaken arrest and deportation to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, and ensuing court battle to bring him home. 
Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the government must “facilitate” Garcia’s return to the U.S., but stopped short of requiring it. On Tuesday, a federal district court judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to show how it has tried to secure the release of Garcia. So far, the judge said the record shows “nothing has been done.”
The White House maintains it has no power to ask El Salvador to release Abrego Garcia from the mega-prison, and that the judge overstepped her authority in ordering the administration to conduct foreign affairs.
At the protest in Juneau, demonstrators gave impromptu speeches denouncing the Trump administration, calling it a violation of due process rights. Speakers called for protection and support for Alaska-based immigrant families, some who received notices to “leave now” and self-deport, some sent in error. They urged Alaskans to continue speaking out, including calling on U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan to do more in Congress. 
“Sending immigrants to an El Salvador prison that is likened to a concentration camp or a gulag, is just reprehensible,” said Mary Hakala, a lifelong Juneau resident in an interview after the protest. 
“(For) everyone in the United States, whether they’re an immigrant, a U.S. citizen, due process is what keeps us all safe,” she said. “And so if they are able to throw out and ignore the laws regarding the rights of citizens and immigrants, none of us are safe. It’s a very frightening time.”
El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a key partner in the Trump administration’s new deportation and imprisonment effort, refused to assist with Garcia’s return in an Oval Office meeting on Monday. “Of course, I’m not going to do it,” he said. “The question is preposterous.”
At that meeting, President Trump expressed openness to deporting U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to El Salvador. “If it’s a homegrown criminal, I have no problem,” Trump told reporters. “We’re studying the laws right now… If we can do that, that’s good.”
The U.S. government is paying El Salvador to imprison immigrants, despite a federal law barring it from financially supporting foreign security forces facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations.

Attorney Philip Thompson, who represented Sapelo residents Barbara Bailey, Christopher Bailey, and Stanley Walker set the scene, telling the justices, “The purpose of this petition is to protect and preserve the Hogg Hummock community, one of the last Gullah Geechee communities in the United States and a cultural and historical treasure, both for the state, but also for the country as well as a whole.”
The case stems from McIntosh’s decision in September 2023 to allow the construction of larger houses in the modest Hogg Hummock neighborhood. Long-time residents feared the resulting gentrification and the higher taxes that accompanied it would drive them out of their ancestral homes in favor of wealthy developers. The county seeks to expand its tax base.
About 96% of Sapelo is owned by the state. In the 434-acre neighborhood of Hogg Hummock, about 250 acres are owned by descendants of enslaved people brought to the island from West Africa. Hogg Hummock is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
To undo the 2023 zoning, residents mounted a petition drive that collected enough signatures to force the county to hold a referendum on the issue. Early voting had already begun in September when the county sued its own Probate Court Judge Harold Webster to stop the referendum. Superior Court Senior Judge Gary McCorvey then agreed with the county that the referendum wasn’t legal, halting the voting midstream.
In a separate, ongoing lawsuit nine Black residents of Sapelo are suing the county in McIntosh Superior Court on the grounds that the zoning measure was unjust and discriminatory. Attorneys from Southern Poverty Law Center and Bondurant, Mixson & Elmore are representing the residents.
Arguments heard Wednesday
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the appeal of McCorvey’s decision Wednesday. Two other related cases were heard at the same time: Webster v. McIntosh County, and McIntosh County v. Webster et. al. These two cases deal directly with McIntosh’s Webster’s approval of the referendum.
The state constitution’s “Home Rule” provision lays out the referendum process, which allows for a vote on “local acts or ordinances, resolutions, or regulations” if the requisite number of county residents sign a petition requesting it.
It’s not the first time a referendum issue has come before the high court. Camden County held a referendum on a proposed spaceport in 2022. The county objected to the referendum in Camden v. Sweatt, but in a unanimous decision the high court affirmed the validity of that vote.
Much of Wednesday’s hearing dealt with whether referenda can be employed to revoke zoning decisions. The county contends the Home Rule provision doesn’t apply to zoning, while the residents and Webster say it does. The justices probed both sides, trying to discern the original intent of lawmakers in a maze of paragraphs and subparagraphs. The questions turned esoteric at times.
“You have paragraph (a) that expressly reserves to the General Assembly, I think, a sort of substantive power to expand or limit anything that comes under that,” said Justice Andrew Pinson. “And then in paragraph four, it reserves to the General Assembly the more limited power to enact procedural things. And so I see there’s sort of a tension between, if zoning comes under (a) what about four?”
Those questions reflected the need to clarify the little-used provision of the Constitution, Thompson said.
“The justices were clearly very well prepared and very tuned in to the difficulties presented by the language of the Constitution,” Thompson told The Current after the hearing. “By language that hasn’t been tested a lot, certainly not on the scale it was tested in the Camden case and now tested here. We feel confident in our position. It’s only a good thing that the judges were so keyed in.”
The justices also examined the fact that the county was suing its own probate judge in his official capacity.
“He’s a county official, right? asked Chief Justice Nels S. D. Peterson. “So isn’t a suit by the county against a county official in their official capacity, essentially a suit by the county against the county?”
The situation means that McIntosh is paying for the attorneys on both sides of its case against Webster.
Several justices seemed concerned that the zoning ordinance in question was not included in the filings.
“So if we don’t have that in the record, what is the court to do?” asked Justice Verda M. Colvin. Jarrard referred them to the language of the referendum question.
The hearing lasted about 45 minutes and can be viewed here.
“McIntosh County appreciated the opportunity to present its position to the Georgia Supreme Court,” Jarrard said. “The County looks forward to receipt of the Court’s ruling.”

“As long as this is accurate it’s OK. Might stir up some media attention,” Dan Welch, the former GOP chair texted to the paid executive director of the party in October of 2020.
“It was a tough piece,” Welch said, telling jurors he “hated attack ads,” but felt they were permitted if accurate and relevant to the race, including one pitting two Republicans against each other — Janet Palmtag, the owner of a Nebraska City real estate firm, and incumbent State Sen. Julie Slama.
Ryan Hamilton, the party’s executive director, responded in an email and in a phone conversation with Welch that he was “certain” it was true, and that he had read a consent agreement signed by the Iowa Real Estate Commission that backed up the accuracy “if anyone questions this.”
The testimony came during the third day of a trial over the alleged defamation of Palmtag by the Nebraska Republican Party during a contentious state legislative campaign in southeast Nebraska.
Palmtag, a long-time GOP volunteer who was backed by several prominent Republicans, lost the 2020 election to Slama, who was appointed to her seat and supported by then-Gov. Pete Ricketts. Three months after the election Palmtag filed a civil lawsuit alleging she was defamed. She is seeking damages from the state GOP for lost business and emotional distress.
Must prove actual malice
Palmtag, who is being represented by prominent Omaha attorney Dave Domina, must prove that the GOP acted with “actual malice” or reckless disregard for the facts in sending out the mailers, which she has labeled as “lies.”

The case is viewed as an important one in the arena of political campaign speech, with the potential to set how far “hit pieces” can go in attacking a rival candidate.
Palmtag testified on Monday that she had voluntarily dropped her Iowa real estate license, and that of her firm, J.J. Palmtag Inc., because the market in the Hawkeye State near Nebraska City had been ruined by flooding.
Palmtag said that she had reached a “consent agreement” with the Iowa commission in 2018 to resolve a mistake made by a gravely ill salesman who had worked for her. She paid a $500 but admitted no violation of state laws. While everyone received their proper payments, the salesman had failed to get all the signatures required in Iowa to transfer an earnest deposit for the sale.
On Wednesday, Welch, an attorney and former member of the Omaha City Council, took the stand to tell jurors that in his opinion, an Iowa law had been broken.
But when asked by Domina if he now feels that Palmtag “lost her license” as the mailers stated, Welch’s answer was nuanced.
“What I now question is how she lost her license, and I don’t know the answer to that,” Welch said.
On Monday, the GOP’s lead attorney, Kamron Hasan told jurors that Hamilton had read the consent agreement and it stated that J.J. Palmtag “had not contested the alleged violation” of Iowa real estate law, and had looked up the status of the company and it read that its license had been “cancelled.”
That, Hasan said, showed that the claims in the campaign mailers were true.
Impact of ads
On Wednesday, Palmtag’s local physician and family friend, Dr. Bradley Vasa, testified that she is still being treated for symptoms of depression brought on by the campaign mailers he labeled “a hit piece” and “false.”

“She changed after that,” Dr. Vasa said, following the mailers from the Nebraska GOP.
Palmtag was “more withdrawn” and less visible in Nebraska City, he said, and fewer “J.J. Palmtag” for-sale signs were visible around town.
Vasa also testified that Palmtag had been treated successfully for intermittent anxiety and migraine headaches prior to 2020, but insisted her condition had worsened after the contentious campaign.
Palmtag’s ex-husband, John, also testified that their 40-year marriage ended in part due to the hurt caused by the campaign claims he labeled as untrue.
Friends and local residents tended to believe they were true, he added, because they came from the party instead of an independent “dark money” group.
One long-time friend of Palmtag’s, Sara Crook, a retired Peru State professor, said she had noticed that Palmtag’s usually upbeat and outgoing personality had changed after the harsh campaign claims made against her in the 2020 campaign.
“In a small town, your reputation means a lot,” Crook said. “It hurt her reputation.”
“If a political party can turn on you,” she added, “how can we get good people to run for office?”
Testimony, via depositions from Hamilton and others, is expected to continue tomorrow with closing arguments scheduled Friday morning.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)The North Carolina Senate approved its Republican-crafted $32.6 billion budget on Wednesday, with GOP members hailing it as fiscally responsible and Democrats decrying its lack of investment in key areas.
“This budget continues the success that North Carolina has seen in the last decade-and-a-half,” said Sen. Brent Jackson (R-Sampson), a lead budget writer.

The legislation would cut hundreds of vacant state government positions, and some filled jobs. Under the plan, educators would see an average 2.3% raise next year and bonuses across two years. Most state employees would receive 1.25% raises and two-year bonuses; correctional officers, law enforcement officers, and highway patrol officers would receive more extensive boosts.
It also increases the subsidy rate for child care providers, sets up money for future Hurricane Helene recovery and funds a new children’s hospital to be built in the Triangle, among other provisions.
Democrats have offered praise for parts of the budget, including pay raises that they say are overdue. But they urged more extensive investment, and warned that planned cuts to state jobs and income taxes did not meet the economic moment.
“Right now, North Carolina needs a record investment in its people, because our house is on fire,” said Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake). “But this budget sends a sympathy card to them instead, saying ‘sorry for your loss,’ instead of a fire truck.”
After a final vote in the Senate that’s expected Thursday, the proposal will go to the House, where members will write and pass their own version. A compromise between the two chambers will eventually go to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk. 
Debate on tax cuts and more as Democrats propose flurry of amendments
The Senate budget continues a plan for tax cuts, despite state economists’ warnings that North Carolina is facing a shortfall in the coming years. It keeps the previously planned cuts to personal income tax rates and continues the phase-out of the corporate income tax. 
Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said earlier this week he did not believe the economic forecast, expressing faith that the state’s growth would continue to exceed expectations.
“What we have seen is the state’s economy continuing to grow and flourish,” Berger said this week.

Sen. Graig Meyer (D-Orange) failed in his attempt Wednesday to stop the corporate income tax phase-out. The scheduled cuts primarily benefit the wealthy, he argued. 
“This is a cheapskate budget. We are not a cheapskate state,” Meyer said. 
“We are leaving North Carolinians behind,” he added, while creating “a structural deficit that is going to leave us in trouble for years to come.”
Among Democrats’ other proposed amendments was one from Sen. Kandie Smith (D-Edgecombe) that would have added a 10% earned income tax credit that Democrats have touted as a more equitable tax break. The state had such a credit earlier in the century, but it was repealed when Republicans gained control of the legislature in 2011. The amendment also proposed to cut the amount of money going toward the Opportunity Scholarships school voucher program.
Sen. Joyce Waddell (D-Mecklenburg) tried to add a 2% cost-of-living raise for state retirees. Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) sought to boost funding to the state’s struggling DMV. And Batch, the Democratic leader, offered a final unsuccessful amendment to raise the state’s minimum wage, as she decried the budget as “anemic.”
Berger, in his closing comments after almost five hours of debate, praised the budget and criticizing Democrats’ attempted amendments.
“The minority caucus, what do they offer the people of North Carolina?” Berger said. “Higher taxes, curtail options that parents have for their children’s education, increased debt, more bureaucracy and higher utility bills.”
Helene recovery
Senate Republicans’ plan sets aside $700 million for future aid in western North Carolina. Gov. Josh Stein is expected to outline a spending request in the coming weeks, after which lawmakers will draw up a new round of relief.
State officials remain wary of reduced and slow-moving money on the federal level.
“We remain hopeful that the federal government will provide increased and expedited reimbursement,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell) said Wednesday. “But we must be prepared to fend for ourselves.”
Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe) ticked off a list of provisions she wished were in the budget to support the region. That included a grant program for small businesses and money to help local governments avoid looming shortfalls.
“Federal money is not flowing yet, and a lot of people are doing stuff about that but we can’t open that spigot,” Mayfield said.



Stein: Senate budget ‘falls short’
Stein, a Democrat, said Wednesday that the Senate’s budget “falls short.”
He added that he would work with lawmakers to “improve this budget” and send additional money to western North Carolina.
“We should be making investments in what makes North Carolina a great place to live: educating the next generation of North Carolinians, growing a strong workforce that drives our economy, and keeping communities safe,” Stein said in a statement.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1640-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 21:01:04.060001

Bernie Sanders of Vermont said his message of money out of politics resonates across the political spectrum. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)MISSOULA — U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders pulled whistles and cheers out of a crowd of Montanans and fans from out of state on Wednesday at the University of Montana as part of his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
“But it’s not just oligarchy and the power of the rich that we are fighting right now,” said Sanders, of Vermont. “We are taking on a president who undermines our constitution every day.”
  People drove from out of state to see Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez in Missoula in April 2025. An estimated 7,500 people filled the Adams Center with another 1,500 outside. Here, rallygoers wait to get into the stadium, some arriving as early as 5 a.m. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)
The full-capacity crowd descended on the Adams Center at UM, some 7,500 people sitting in the bleachers and standing on the floor, with an estimated 1,500 more spilling far outside the doors.
“Brothers and sisters, we are tired of being oppressed,” Sanders said in a more than 30 minute speech that brought the crowd to its feet repeatedly. “We believe in democracy, not authoritarianism. We believe in an economy that works for all, not just for Musk and his fellow billionaires.”
Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats but stings them with criticism as well, said billionaire Elon Musk poured $270 million into the campaign of Republican U.S. President Donald Trump.
“His reward for that $270 million was to be made the most important person in the United States government,” Sanders said.
But he said Democratic billionaires are a problem as well.
“There is a reason why, over the years, the Democratic Party has not been as strong as it should be in standing up for the working class,” Sanders said.
Members of the crowd came from Missoula and from outside Montana, the early risers in line by 5 a.m.
They came to hear the message from the progressive politicians and star Montanans rallying people to push against a system they describe as broken for everyday workers and devastating the things they love.
They came because they are worried — about Social Security, human rights, due process for all people, federal workers, Medicare, education.
They came to be encouraged — to stay involved in politics and hear a message from Sanders, a politician some have admired for decades.

Sarah Willis said she’s a lesbian from Livingston who is “up to my ears” with Trump and his followers.
“I just want to feel good and inspired, like there’s some hope,” Willis said.
In November 2024, Trump won his second election for president, with 58.4% of the vote in Montana, a higher margin than he earned in 2020.
In a social media post Wednesday, Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte reminded people voters had chosen Trump — and rejected his opponent and the vision of the visitors to Montana.
“Bernie Sanders and AOC are in Montana pushing their far–left agenda — but Montanans rejected them and their puppet Joe Biden after four years of failed policies,” Gianforte said.
“The people have spoken. They aren’t feeling the Bern.”
However, some Montanans have seen consequences they don’t like from the Trump administration.
Workers for the U.S. Forest Service have lost their jobs, the Montana Food Bank Network has lost money for food that goes to pantries across the state, and international students at the Montana University System recently lost visas.
Cammie Edgar of Stevensville said she’s worried about cuts to federal institutions including those earlier this month at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a National Institutes of Health research facility in Hamilton.
The facility lost two dozen employees earlier this month as part of a nationwide reduction intended to take the NIH down by 1,200 workers, according to the Ravalli Republic.
“That’s going to hit the Bitterroot Valley really hard,” said Edgar, who wore a T-shirt that read, “This is my living in unprecedented times shirt.”
Ahead of the keynote, Tracy Stone-Manning, former head of the Bureau of Land Management, warned the crowd of more to come, such as potential sales of public lands.

But Stone-Manning also said the country needs Montanans.
Stone-Manning, head of The Wilderness Society, said the organization turned 90 this year, founded by Bob Marshall, of the eponymous Bob Marshall Wilderness Area.
Marshall said the country needed “spirited people who will fight for the freedom of wilderness,” she said.
“Y’all know a thing or two about bringing spirit,” Stone Manning said.
She asked people to bring that spirit to fight for the Forest Service, the Park Service, the BLM, their favorite trailhead.
National parks brought Connie Sidebottom of Polson to the rally. Sidebottom wore a “Resist” button with Smokey Bear, and she said she’s worried about cuts to the places she loves.

“I want to resist because I love our national parks,” Sidebottom said.
She and her husband, Ralph, take their grandsons to a national park every year, and in 2010 or so, they saw a grizzly mama and cubs in Yellowstone National Park.
“We take our grandsons to parks so they love them like we do,” Connie Sidebottom said.
Ocasio-Cortez, a former waitress, said the crowd had gathered because people share a frustration and heartache that comes from watching those in power actively tear down the country and refuse to fight for everyday working Americans.
“We are watching as our neighbors, students and friends are being fired, targeted and disappeared,” said Ocasio-Cortez, of New York.
The possible contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028 said people who are LGBTQ+ are being harassed, immigrants are being taken off the streets by men in vans without uniforms, and educators are being fired for teaching American history accurately.
She said the Trump administration jailed a husband and father without evidence of a crime.

But Ocasio-Cortez said it will always be the people, the masses, who refuse to comply with authoritarian regimes, who will uphold democracy.
“Know that a better world is possible, and we are willing to do something about it,” Ocasio-Cortez said.
But she also said the political state of affairs didn’t come out of the blue. It has been a long time coming, she said, and it is tied directly to the growing and extreme wealth inequality building in America for years.
“Donald Trump is not an aberration,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “He is the logical conclusion of an American political system dominated by corporate and dark money.”
She told Montana that America is at a crossroads, and some members of the crowd saw the crossroads in their own lives.

John Moderie, of Missoula, said he hasn’t been politically active in the past.
But he’s on Social Security, and he’s worried about it, along with a multitude of other things.
“I don’t really lean left or right too much, but what’s going on woke me up, got me stirred up,” said Moderie, who wore a black leather vest with the American flag on the back. “So I’m political now.”
His brother, Mike Moderie, wore his “Fight Oligarchy” T-shirt over a Kamala Harris T-shirt written in UM-Grizzlies-maroon.
Harris, a Democrat, lost her presidential bid against Trump, but Moderie said he’s alarmed at the actions of the government, and he wants Republican representatives to impeach Trump.
He also said he wants people in the United States to follow Turkey’s lead in the ferocity of their political activism.
“They’re filling the streets up and pushing their leaders out,” Moderie said.
The crowd booed when the speakers mentioned members of Montana’s Republican Congressional delegation and Gianforte, a multimillionaire, and they cheered when Ocasio-Cortez said she knew Missoula had elected Democratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr to Montana’s Legislature.
One of the Montana speakers, Anne Hedges with the Montana Environmental Information Center, spoke to the wealth and power in the Treasure State, in times past and the current day.
She said Montanans are familiar with oligarchs of the past, the timber barons and the Copper Kings.
Now, she said, Montanans are beholden to NorthWestern Energy, a monopoly utility she said is fighting a healthy climate, recently raised rates 28%, and is asking for 26% more.
“Montana simply cannot afford these modern-day robber barons,” Hedges said.
Although the speakers railed against money in politics, their fight takes resources too.
A media contact for the Fighting Oligarchy event did not answer a question about the cost of the tours or sources of funds.
However, Sanders’ campaign committee listed on the Fighting Oligarchy website, Friends of Bernie Sanders, pulled in $11.5 million in the most recent quarter, of which $9.7 million came from donations of $200 or less, according to the most recent report filed with the Federal Elections Commission.
Ocasio-Cortez reminded the crowd that she pledged when she first ran for office that she would never take corporate donations, although an investigation by the Washington Examiner showed she has taken significant money from lobbyists representing powerful corporate clients.
But she also illustrated the influence of lobbyists in Washington, D.C., when she landed on the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce and said all of a sudden, her phone lines lit up with lobbyists who wanted to be her new best friend.
Ocasio-Cortez said the tour had recently drawn 12,000 people in red Idaho, 20,000 in Salt Lake City, and 36,000 in Los Angeles.
She said she learned on the way to Missoula that some House Republicans in districts where they’d held rallies wrote a letter warning Republican leadership: “We don’t know if we can vote for Medicaid cuts now.”

The politicians encouraged the crowd to run for office and stay involved, to hold their elected officials’ feet to the fire, and rallygoer Brittany Doctor said she always drags her significant other, Aaron Leek, to political debates and town halls.
Doctor and Leek drove from Walla Walla, Washington, for the event the night before, and they were second in line at 5 a.m. Wednesday.
Doctor said they’ve been disappointed that Republican Congressman Michael Baumgartner stopped doing town halls in their district.
But they both love Sanders and his message to the people.
“We’re taking every opportunity we can to, I guess, liberate ourselves,” Doctor said.
Allison Wilson, 24, said she works at the Poverello Center, a soup kitchen and shelter in Missoula, and she feels anxious about everything.
“I came to hear Bernie and AOC and to feel connected in the community, gain some hope out of it,” Wilson said.

Wilson said she’s seeing federal money dry up including dollars that go to local government and support housing programs.
“It just sucks that you can see a big storm coming,” Wilson said. “I know for sure I feel nervous.”
The Trump administration is making deep cuts to the federal government and its employees, and speakers and members of the crowd said the trend worried them.
Sam Forstag, a wildland firefighter for the U.S. Forest Service and union leader, told the crowd he has coworkers and friends “who’ve broken their backs and died in their boots making $15 an hour as a federal employee.”
“When I talk to my coworkers today, I hear a lot of people who are trying real hard just to hold onto hope because right now, the people who give their lives to public lands and public service are under attack,” said Forstag, who noted he was speaking personally and not in an official capacity.
Joan Egan, 80, said in the place she lives, many residents exist on Social Security, “and they’re very frightened.”
She said the nation is rapidly descending into an oligarchy, and she was hoping to help gird it against the slide.
“We’re here to try to save our nation,” Egan said.

On a 97-0 vote, the House amended, then passed Senate Bill 5263 on Wednesday to put Washington, for the first time, on a course to fully fund special education in its public schools.
It also adjusted two other funding levers in the bill to drive more dollars for special education to the state’s 295 school districts. All told, roughly $870 million more will be sent out over the next two budgets. That sum is a compromise with the Senate, which wanted to spend closer to $2 billion. 
Rep. Gerry Pollet, D-Seattle, who called the cap “unconscionable and maybe unconstitutional,” said its elimination is “a historic achievement.” It commits the state to amply fund the education of every child with a disability, he said.
Ditching the cap “is the very first step to saying we’re going to fully fund special education. This is going to absolutely help our schools,” said Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, who has three children with individualized education plans, or IEPs — plans developed for every public school student who needs special education services.
“It represents something we should all be proud of,” he said. Couture urged his colleagues to guard against any weakening of the legislation in the final stages of budget talks. 
Also Wednesday, the House passed a Senate bill to send additional dollars to districts to cover materials, supplies and operating costs — MSOC in state budget lingo. These costs, which cover non-employee-related expenses tied to a district’s daily operations, have surged in recent years.
“This is a bill that will literally keep the lights on in schools,” said Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek, a former school board member.
The House amended, then passed Senate Bill 5192 on an 85-12 vote. It would boost the amount of state funding per student for MSOC to $1,614, an increase of $35. An additional $214.94 is provided for each high school student. That’s four dollars more than the current rate.
Couture opposed this legislation, saying it’s too small an increase to help the most needy districts.
“I don’t think an extra $35 will keep the lights on,” he said.
Cap would be removed
Special education is the area where the gap is largest between what districts receive from the state and what they pay for with local dollars. 
In the 2022-23 school year, districts spent $590 million of local levy receipts to make up the difference, according to a performance audit issued in January by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee.
Washington uses two key mechanisms for determining what a district receives.
First, there is the cap on the percentage of a school district’s student population that can receive extra dollars for special education services. 
Under current law, the state only provides additional funding for up to 16% of a district’s student population. In other words, if 20% of a district’s population requires special education services, the district cannot get additional money for the remaining 4%.
Second, the state distributes an amount of money for each student enrolled in a school, plus additional dollars for each special education student under a formula known as the multiplier.
Senate Bill 5263 removes the enrollment cap and increases the multiplier to send more dollars to districts. 
It also simplifies the formula used by the state to determine how much will be provided per student. And it makes it easier for districts to qualify for additional special education dollars through a safety net program run by the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction.
Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, and Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, are the bill’s co-sponsors.
Pedersen, prior to the Senate vote, acknowledged the state’s tight budget situation this year but said Washington’s Constitution “is very clear that funding basic education is our paramount duty.”
“The fact that it is expensive doesn’t change that on the ground we’ve got kids with special needs who are in our charge and are relying on us to make sure that they get the education to which they’re entitled,” he said.
Initially, the House upped the multiplier and safety net but left the enrollment cap in place. 
Pollet continued to press for the cap’s erasure as he has for the past 13 years. This time he prevailed. Changes made Wednesday will pump out $870 million to districts, he said.
If House Bill 2049 passes, it will be more, he said. 
That bill would allow an increase in annual property tax growth from the current 1% cap to the combined rate of population growth plus inflation within a taxing district, not to exceed 3%. This would apply to the state’s property tax, also known as the common schools levy.
The bill would also make other changes that could help districts receive more taxpayer dollars.
A fiscal analysis estimates that uncapping the state property tax would bring in an additional $200 million in the next biennium and $618 million in the 2027-29 budget. School districts collectively could raise another $900 million locally over four years. The legislation is slated to be voted on Friday in the House Finance Committee.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/classroom-students-raising-hands.jpg,,,2025-04-16 21:01:04.060001

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Two furloughed employees with the U.S. Department of Education warned Colorado lawmakers on Wednesday that a reduced workforce in the department could result in delayed or incorrectly disbursed grant money to the state.
The Colorado Department of Education receives about $870 million from the federal government, or a little over 11% of its money, according to Commissioner of Education Susana Córdova.
“The funding that we receive through all of these different funding sources are supplemental funds that really are essential to services, particularly for the most vulnerable students,” she said during a special Senate Education Committee hearing.

That money comes from grant allocations doled out by program, ranging from about $206 million for special education and services for students with disabilities to about $371,000 for students in juvenile detention centers or other alternative education settings. Other programs support students in poverty, students learning English and out-of-school enrichment programs.
Since 2010, the money has spread across over 100 grant programs for a total of over $20 billion.
But two recently-furloughed employees from the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education said that the slashed workforce directed by the Trump administration could endanger efficient data processing and ultimately disturb the timeline and accuracy of funding disbursements.
“The office’s day-to-day operations are guided by a grant making life cycle, which includes pre-award, award and post-award activities. It is not as simple as writing a check,” said Sarah Newman, who helped lead the office’s data management team.
The work includes publicizing grant opportunities, assessing grantee risk, calculating funding using formulas, ensuring compliance and providing technical assistance. All of that relies on data processed and maintained by Newman’s team. They looked for anomalies and errors that would affect funding.
Since President Donald Trump ordered the drastic reduction of the department in March, about 90% of the OESE workforce has been fired or left, Newman said. Trump has repeatedly called for the closure of the Department of Education, which he does not have the power to do as president, but he can severely reduce its capacity.
“Since January 20, the current administration has taken numerous actions that have threatened the operations of (the Education Department), as well as the sustainability of the funding and services Colorado currently receives,” Newman said. “I stand before you today concerned that, beginning with this next fiscal year, the federal funds Colorado schools have come to rely on will not be there.”
It could also impact the current round of funding. Even though data was submitted and sent to the programs, people on the team were fired before the standard correction period ended.
“I worry that the decisions made to distribute the grants on July 1 are based on preliminary data, which the states did not have an opportunity to correct or explain. I also have concerns about the program’s ability to do all the work required just to make the awards in time,” said data analyst Joe Murphy.
Murphy and Newman emphasized that delayed, repurposed or eliminated funding would have the biggest impact on school districts in poor and rural areas. Littleton Public Schools, for example, gets about 5% of its funding from the federal government, but Fountain-Fort Carson School District 8, which misses out on property tax revenue because of its proximity to an Army base, gets 30% of its funding from federal sources.
Newman and Murphy suggested that state lawmakers try to use historical funding data and codify at the state level the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, which is the country’s main education law. The law includes the federal programs related to low-income students, students of color, students with disabilities, English Learners and other historically marginalized students.
Murphy worries that the federal government will resort to giving block grants to states, rather than divided up by program. That switch would require a change in federal law.
“You can look at what’s in ESSA and say, ‘These are the funds, and this is where they’re supposed to go’ and carry that out at the state level,” Murphy said.
The state’s legislative session ends the first week of May, so such a large policy undertaking could be near-impossible this year.
Córdova, the education commissioner, told lawmakers that she is hopeful that “verbal commitments” to maintain program funding for low-income students and students with disabilities will stick.
“What we’ve heard from the new secretary of Education is a commitment to continue funding,” she said. “We’re very hopeful that that would be the case, because I think absent that funding, very important and critical services would be missing for students who rely on them.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A $15 million obligation to cover deficits in the Providence Public School District (PPSD) may have come under duress for Mayor Brett Smiley last fall, but he posed it as a win in his fiscal 2026 budget address Wednesday at City Hall.
“This budget includes the largest investment in our schools since at least 2006, making up for a generation of underfunding of our educational system in one fiscal year,” Smiley said in unveiling his $624.1 million spending plan.
But he said the city needs $25 million in new revenue to satisfy all the terms of the November settlement with the Rhode Island Department of Education, which has controlled Providence’s public schools since 2019. The proposed budget represents a roughly 4% increase in spending over the current fiscal year that ends June 30. 
The city is relying on a $29 million increase in its tax levy to support the proposed budget, with $23 million coming from new revenue sources. One of the primary mechanisms for getting that revenue, however, depends on authorization from the General Assembly allowing the city to raise its tax revenue above the 4% state cap for the next fiscal year. 
Smiley’s proposed budget assumes the city will acquire the state approval needed to raise its tax levy, or total collected tax revenue, by 7.5%. The mayor’s spending plan has actually lowered tax rates for all types of properties, but recent, state-mandated reassessments of home values in Providence mean that, even with the lower tax rates, the city would still go beyond the levy.
That’s why Smiley is waiting on state approval of a city-sponsored tax levy bill. An initial version of the bill stalled in March as Providence lawmakers  held off to allow the Providence City Council to make recommendations. On April 2, Providence Democratic Rep. Rebecca Kislak introduced the current iteration, which has yet to be scheduled for a committee hearing. 
Companion Senate legislation, meanwhile, has yet to be introduced. Sponsor Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, said he intends to introduce the bill once the state legislature resumes next week.  
Kislak said via text Wednesday that maneuvering the bill through the State House has been difficult because state reps haven’t had all the needed facts.
“Where the mayor and city council (unanimously) are in agreement, I think the state should give them reasonable leeway to exceed the levy cap,” Kislak wrote. “And once we see the budget we can have concrete conversations about the policy (and levy cap) which until tonight were hard to have. We didn’t have any way to talk about what the cost would be to Providence homeowners.”
If the levy hike failed, Smiley’s budget would return to the City Council, which would need to cut and pivot accordingly to keep it under the existing cap. Should that happen, Kislak noted that the State House can help in other ways, and that proposed legislation relating to parking lot and Airbnb taxes could help plug the gaps. 
Speaking to reporters after his speech, Smiley said he’s still “confident that the General Assembly would pass our request for a one-time exception to the cap. Were that not to pass, we’d be back to the drawing board, and we’re going to have to make very serious cuts. But I don’t think anyone wants to do that, and I think especially now that the actual tax rates are out, and instead of talking in the abstract, we’re talking about specifics.”
Balancing act
This year’s spending plan would have been actually $9 million less than last year, if not for the settlement payment, Smiley said in his speech. 
“We think we found that right balance,” Smiley told reporters after his speech. “At least $9 million worth of cuts is exceptional. That never happens in city government.”
The tightrope act was so successful, Smiley said, that the tax increase “we feared was necessary” became “the lowest responsible rate,” the mayor said.
The increase is a little more complicated underneath the hood: The city actually had to adjust and lower the ratios between different kinds of tax rates to comply with state laws. But, Smiley noted in his speech, “Many people’s homes may be worth significantly more than they were 10 years ago,” and for fiscal year 2026, some types of properties in Providence saw their value jump over 30% or 40%. Adjusting the ratio tax rates cushioned the increase to individual tax bills while increasing the levy overall.   
After adjusting for the lowered tax rates and increased property value, the proposed rates are:

4% for single-family homes. The average value went up 31% to $551,881. The average tax bill would go up $161, from $4,392 to $4,553. 
16% for owner-occupied homes with two to five families. The average value increased 47% to $585,027. The average tax bill would go up $650, from $4,176 to $4,826. 
4%  for owner-occupied condos. The average value rose 32% to $507,713. The average tax bill would go up $166, from $4,023 to $4,189. 
5% for single-Family Homes, non-owner-occupied. The average value went up 33% to $445,385. The average tax bill would go up $287, from $6,127 to $6,414. 
16% for non-owner-occupied homes with two to five families. The average value went up 48% to $606,365. The average tax bill would go up $1,197, from $7,534 to $8,732. 
5% for non-owner-occupied condos.The average value went up 33% to $335,877. The average tax bill would go up $220, from $4,617 to $4,837. 
5% for buildings with six to 10 units. The average value went up 36% to $947,975. The average tax bill would go down $1,157, from $24,382 to $23,225. 
-1% for buildings with 11 or more units. The average value went up 28% to $4,832,121. The average tax bill would go up $1,699, from $132,392 to $134,091. 
-2% for commercial Properties. The average value went up 20% to $855,368. The average tax bill would go down $401, from $25,035 to $24,635.

In the meantime, Smiley didn’t want to put the onus of this debt entirely on the city’s residents. About 96% of the city’s costs are fixed year over year, and the remaining 4% is more flexible. City accountants exercised their cleverness to reduce spending without pilfering too much from residents’ pocketbooks. 
“There’s only three ways to balance this budget,” Smiley said. “Either we raise property taxes, we find other revenues, or we make cuts. The budget that I propose tonight does all three things, and it tries to do all three things and strike the right balance.”










We think we found that right balance. At least $9 million worth of cuts is exceptional. That never happens in city government.


–  Providence Mayor Brett Smiley


Property tax exemptions for people over age 65 and veterans would see 25% and 100% increases, respectively, to mitigate the tax hikes.  
The city expects to cut 23 positions, many of them vacant. Only two would require layoffs, and both are nonunion, city officials said. Cost of living adjustments will be paused for nonunion employees making over $100,000. A $3.2 million savings in public safety overtime, meanwhile, is largely possible because of increased staffing in the municipal fire department.
There’s also a $2.8 million cut in services, but these do not represent an elimination of resident-facing programs, officials said. Residents would not see reductions in direct services like trash pickup — an earlier idea to pick up garbage every other week has been nixed, for instance. The 8% reduction in services in the mayor’s spending plan, city officials said, involves more cuts to internal purchases or contracts within city departments.
Alas, life in the city will not go untouched. Take the shiny new parking kiosks Smiley mentioned in his budget address last year, which could now be bearers of bad news for drivers who forget to feed the meter.
A number of fees and fines could eke up. Among the fee changes:

The fine for “overtime parking” from 2 to 5 a.m. would go from $20 to $50.
Parking at an expired meter would rise from $25 to $40.
Parking in a prohibited area would rise $30 to $50.
Parking in an emergency zone would rise from $100 to $250, although the city is considering raising the cost only for nonresidents.

The budget is available on the city’s website. City Council committee meetings will see the budget inspected and reviewed, and council members have the power to edit line items. The final budget will emerge in June.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)House Democrats think their most likely strategy to prevent major cuts to Medicaid or other popular federal programs in the current budget reconciliation process will be to win over a few House Republicans.
“We just need three Republicans, basically nationwide, to say no to something,” said U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Black Earth) at a Q-and-A session with reporters Wednesday in his Madison office.
The Republican majorities in both houses of Congress are using the complicated budget reconciliation process to pass a spending plan that will allow them to extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 during President Donald Trump’s first term.
As part of that, House Republicans passed a blueprint calling for $880 billion in cuts to programs overseen by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Medicaid represents the largest expense item in the committee’s purview, and analysts have said Congress could only hit that target by making Medicaid cuts.
Pocan said estimates of the cost of preserving the tax cuts have risen in Washington, from $4.5 trillion in the original House proposal to “more like $7 trillion in tax cuts” in the current proposal combined from House and Senate alternatives.
The objective for House Democrats currently is to make cuts to Medicaid harder for GOP members to go along with, Pocan said. In Wisconsin, about 1.3 million residents are enrolled in Medicaid, including one third of the children in the state and 55% of seniors in nursing homes.
“You know, the more they hear that, at some point they may listen,” Pocan said of Republican members who won swing districts by narrow margins — and, he argues, they could push back against those sorts of cuts.
“I don’t expect them to maybe say it publicly and maybe to hold a town hall and say it, but if they say it privately in their caucus, that’s good enough, as long as three people won’t support something,” Pocan said. “That’s enough to kill something, right? So that’s kind of my goal is to keep facilitating that.”
The focus, though, is not on stopping the tax cuts, but stopping the cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other federal programs.
“If we could stop that, and we could stop, maybe, some of the education cuts that might otherwise come … funds for low-income [districts], funds for special ed, I think they’re still going to move forward with their tax cut bill,” Pocan said.
He speculated that under those circumstances, the GOP majority would pay for the tax cut with a deficit increase. 
“Is that a good answer? No,” Pocan said. “But is it better than seeing people lose their health care right now or their food assistance through Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program? Yeah. So you know my job is to wake up in the morning and get excited about bad choices rather than the worst choices.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa is an outlier for the wrong reasons, according to several environmental advocates who spoke at the Harkin Institute’s annual wellness symposium, which this year focused on the future of clean water. 
Speakers at the symposium noted Iowa’s cancer rates, which are the second-highest in the nation, the state’s overwhelming amounts of animal manure and its problems with polluted water. 
This was the setup to launch an initiative between the Iowa Environmental Council and the Harkin Institute to explore the relationship between environmental risk factors and cancer rates in Iowa. 
“At its heart, this entire initiative is about each out you, and about Iowans,” Sarah Green, IEC’s executive director said.

The initiative will combine both community outreach and a “rigorous” review of academic research on the subject. 
The review will result in a public report and journal article with visual data mapping to show environmental risks and cancer rates. The two organizations aim to share these reports widely across the state and hold 15 listening tours to hear and amplify Iowan’s lived experiences with cancer. 
“Our goal is to give voice to Iowans — whether they’re urban or rural — give them a voice, give them the opportunity to share and document their story,” Green said.

Green said it’s now “well established” that certain factors, like tobacco use, tanning beds and alcohol consumption contribute to cancer rates, but she questioned “what else might be at play.” 
Cancer research was a priority outlined in Gov. Kim Reynold’s Condition of the State address earlier this year, when she called on the Legislature to fund a $1 million partnership between the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services and the University of Iowa to research factors contributing to Iowa cancer cases.
Adam Shriver, the director of wellness and nutrition policy at the Harkin Institute, said the partnership between Harkin and IEC would “address the gaps” in the conversations about cancer in the state.
“Part of what’s motivating our project is that even though there are lots of groups talking about studying the high cancer rates, there are some groups that want to limit what we’re looking at when we’re having these conversations” Shriver said. 
Future of clean water
The Harkin Institute for Public Policy & Citizen Engagement, based at Drake University aims to facilitate public policy research and citizen engagement. Previous iterations of the Harkin On Wellness symposium have centered on topics like well-being in schools and healthy food. 
Sue Mattison, Drake University’s provost, said the 2025 topic, the future of clean water, touches “every community, every discipline and every life.” 
Mattison, who is also an epidemiologist, said she has seen “firsthand” the impact environmental factors, like water quality, can have on health outcomes. 
“We know that climate change, population growth, pollution and the burden of inequitable environmental infrastructure are putting immense pressure on our water systems, and it’s clear that no single sector can change these challenges alone,” Mattison said in her opening comments at the symposium. “The problems we face require collaboration across every sector.” 
The event featured speakers across disciplines who discussed the need for cleaner water through the lenses of cancer research, environmental ligation, public policy, community action and even art, with a satirical video listing the ingredients in Iowa’s “pure” drinking water. 
Speakers identified industrial agriculture practices, like the over-application of nutrients to cropland, and runoff from confined animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, as key polluters to Iowa’s water. 
The most mentioned pollutant, nitrate, enters streams from manure, fertilizer, septic and sewage runoff. On its own, nitrate is not a carcinogen, but when ingested, it interacts with other compounds that can be carcinogenic, according to the National Cancer Institute. 
Excessive consumption of nitrate can also cause health issues like blue baby syndrome, thyroid problems and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Citizen scientists take to Iowa’s waters to monitor nitrate levels

Lu Liu, an assistant professor at Iowa State University, said only 4% of public water systems in Iowa treat drinking water for nitrates, according to a recent study. 
The study “Disparities in potential exposures to elevated nitrate in Iowa’s Public Water Systems” was published in February and found that more than 7% of Iowa’s average population are exposed to drinking water with nitrate levels in excess of 5 milligrams per liter. This metric is half of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s limit on nitrate in drinking water, but Liu said existing research of exposure at the 5 mg/L level has demonstrated negative health outcomes.
Jim Larew, an attorney with the northeastern Iowa environmental group Driftless Water Defenders, said he has seen the reputation of Iowa change over the years from a state with high education rates and healthy citizens, to the state with some of the highest rates of cancer in the country. 
Larew, who has litigated against issues like the renewal of a water use permit for a CAFO at the head waters of a trout stream, said it would be a “misstatement” to blame all of the cancer in the state on industrial agriculture.
“But surely, when you look at the maps and incidences of cancer and where we’re doing the most intensive farming, there’s at least an association,” Larew said. 
He said environmental work, to him, is also a social movement that is on the “cusp of a civil rights movement” in Iowa. 
“This is not something that just involves lawyers and judges — if we’re going to move things in the right direction — it requires people,” Larew said.

“It would reduce consumer cost and have significant environmental and economic benefits,” Lands told the committee prior to the public hearing. “It promotes affordability, sustainability and access to critical supplies.”

The bill states that an original equipment manufacturer will not impose contractual limitations on access to documents that outline how to repair the items they make.
Manufacturers will also ensure that parts are available to repair their devices for at least five years after the discontinue making the item and that the parts are offered on “fair and reasonable” terms without requiring consumers or repair shops to buy additional services from them.
It also makes manufacturers subject to a $10,000 fine for not complying with the provisions in the bill and allows consumers and repair shops to file lawsuits against manufacturers for violating elements of the bill.
Members of the public spoke both in favor of and against the legislation.
“It is wonderful for our environment to keep appliances going for longer rather than throwing them into landfills, particularly with the sort of toxic components that are often involved in e-waste,” said Tabitha Isner, who spoke in favor of the legislation. “It is also great for the economy to have folks who are able to make a small business out of repairing electronics.”
Dustin Brighton, director Repair Done Right Coalition, an organization that advocates for the safe and secure repair of electronic devices opposed the bill, saying that it would lead to safety risk and threats for Alabama residents.
“Mandating that companies outsource their repair service to a third-party network prevents them from being able to fully stand behind their products’ safety and security,” he said.
The committee plans to vote on the legislation next week.

Josh Shapiro flatly condemned political violence without commenting on the motives of the man accused of firebombing his official residence, after court documents revealed 38-year-old Cody Balmer made a reference to Palestine in a call to authorities after the attack.
“I know there are people out there who want to adopt their own political viewpoints or their own world views to what happened and why. I choose not to participate in that,” Shapiro told reporters Wednesday during a stop in Derry Township, Dauphin County. He and his family were awakened during the attack about 2 a.m. Sunday by a state trooper assigned to his security detail and directed to evacuate the residence.
Shapiro noted he had similarly avoided speculation after the attempted assassination of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in July and the arrest in Altoona of the man charged with shooting and killing United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.
“This kind of violence has no place in our society, regardless of what motivates it,” Shapiro said. “This level of violence has to end, and it has to be roundly condemned by everyone, both political parties, people from all different walks of life.”

In an interview Tuesday on WILK-AM in Wilkes-Barre, U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District) expressed sympathy for Shapiro and his family, but was critical of Shapiro’s opposition to the Trump administration. He suggested that it was contributing to political tension, adding, “They got to tone it down.”
“I mean, every action Josh Shapiro has taken against the president has either been a lawsuit or a falsehood,” Meuser claimed in the interview.
Apparently surprised by a reporter’s summation of Meuser’s remarks, Shapiro said elected leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity. “It would appear that the congressman failed to measure up to that,” Shapiro said.
Members of Pennsylvania Islamic organizations condemned the attack but also expressed worry that Balmer’s statements could intensify Islamophobia across the nation.
Court officials released search warrants Wednesday for Balmer’s home, a storage locker and for a sample of his DNA that provided new information about his actions after the attack on the Governor’s Residence around 2 a.m. Sunday morning.

Balmer is charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault and related offenses. A Dauphin County district judge ordered him held without bail during his arraignment Monday. Relatives of Balmer told CBS news and the Associated Press that he had struggled with mental illness and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had been treated in a psychiatric hospital twice. 
Police allege Balmer scaled a fence to enter the grounds, broke two windows and used Molotov cocktails to set fire to public areas of the residence including the state dining room where Shapiro had hosted Passover Seder with family and guests hours earlier. They said Balmer admitted that he hated Shapiro in an interview with investigators after his arrest.
Shapiro, who is Jewish, has drawn criticism for his support of Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks that killed more than 1,200 Israelis. It centered on his remarks labeling pro-Palestine protests against Jewish-owned businesses antisemitic and urging the University of Pennsylvania and other institutions to quell campus protests.
After fleeing the Governor’s Residence, Balmer called 911 and told a dispatcher his name, stating Shapiro needed to know Balmer “… will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.”
Balmer also said in the 911 call Shapiro needs to stop having Balmer’s friends killed and “our people have been put through too much by that monster,” according to the search warrants. He concluded the call by telling the dispatcher “all [Shapiro] has is a banquet hall to clean up,” police know where to find him, and that he would confess “to everything that I had done.”
The warrant concluded Balmer’s remarks demonstrate his political motives and requested court approval to seize electronic devices and writings that mention Shapiro, Israel, Palestine or Gaza.

Shapiro said it was for prosecutors to determine what motivated the attack, and referred further questions to the Dauphin County district attorney’s office and the U.S. Department of Justice. A spokesperson for U.S. Attorney John Gurganus said he had no comment Wednesday.
Under Pennsylvania law. ethnic intimidation is an offense that can be added to enhance another offense such as aggravated assault by increasing the possible penalties.
More than two dozen mosques and Islamic community organizations across the statehave signed a letter expressing shock and outrage about the attack and condemning violence. The letter says the group’s members pray for Shapiro and his family’s safety and noted that Shapiro and previous governors have opened the official residence to leaders of diverse faiths.
“The horrifying images of the damage inflicted upon this historic space have shaken our community and reinforced our concern that the rising tide of hateful rhetoric and the current political climate pose a grave threat to our shared vision of a peaceful, inclusive Pennsylvania,” the letter says.
Ahmet Tekelioglu, executive director of the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the acts Balmer is accused of are not those of the pro-Palistine movement. 
“It’s important to note the pro-Palistine movement in the United States has followed the tradition in American democracy of nonviolent protest,” Tekelioglu said, adding that while CAIR has disagreed with some of Shapiro’s statements, “We don’t think that this is, in a real democracy, how things get resolved.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a $6.2 billion draft state operating budget, putting Alaska on track for a significant deficit in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
If Wednesday’s draft is added to a capital budget draft passed Tuesday by the Senate and a planned supplemental budget needed to fix a deficit in the current fiscal year, total general-purpose spending is near $6.6 billion. 
Meanwhile, the Alaska Department of Revenue expects $6.1 billion in general-purpose revenue during the upcoming fiscal year. The House is proposing to spend from the Constitutional Budget Reserve, the state’s main savings account, to balance the budget.
“This is the best our body can do right now,” said House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage.
Kopp went on to say that the House-passed budget is preliminary and subject to change by the Senate.
An earlier version of the House budget included $2.5 billion for the 2025 Permanent Fund dividend, enough to pay almost $3,900 to every recipient. To reduce the size of the expected deficit, the House voted to cut PFD spending to $950 million, a payout of about $1,400 per recipient.
“Some may argue that we should cut the fat. What fat is there? We are at the bone,” said Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the House Finance Committee.

The one major increase in the budget is an $86 million increase to K-12 public school funding, equivalent to a one-time $1,000 increase to the base student allocation, core of the state’s per-student funding formula. 
Last year, lawmakers approved a one-time $680 increase to the BSA. 
“I want to celebrate today … this is a pro-growth budget that puts our state on a path toward prosperity,” said Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage.
Wednesday’s vote fell along caucus lines, as all 21 members of the House’s coalition majority — 2 Republicans, 5 independents and 14 Democrats — voted in favor of the budget draft. 
All 19 members of the House’s Republican minority voted against it, with some citing the deficit.
“This budget is a bunch of lofty promises. That’s what’s so heartbreaking about it, because everybody here knows they will not be kept,” said Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer and a member of the minority.

Vance and other members of the minority said the budget is unsustainable because it relies on spending from savings. Even if the CBR — which contains $2.8 billion — is sufficient to cover this year’s deficit, it may not be enough to cover next year’s projected gap, which is expected to be worse.
“This budget makes promises it can’t keep,” said Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer and a member of the minority.
“It will probably be the other body that takes on the responsibility that we have given up,” she said, referring to the Senate.
Senate leaders have said throughout the session that their aim is to pass a budget without drawing from savings.
“We’ve got to balance the budget without a CBR draw for this year and prepare for next year,” said Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, in a Tuesday news conference with reporters.
Over the next fiscal year, the Alaska Department of Revenue expects North Slope oil prices to average $68 per barrel. That’s significantly lower than the current year and would reduce the amount of revenue available to the state.
“To the fundamental core question: Can the Senate balance the budget at $68? The answer is yes. Is it going to be fun, without any difficult decisions? No,” Stedman said.
Asked where the Senate’s cuts will be, Stedman said that remains to be determined.
“Everything’s in play,” he said.

(Photo by Adam Gault/Getty Images)As a board-certified family and lifestyle medicine physician in Salt Lake City, I laud both the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency for separately announcing initiatives last week to start backing off of animal testing.
In a news release on April 10, the FDA said it plans to phase out animal testing in the development of monoclonal antibody therapies and other drugs with more effective, human-relevant methods. “The new approach,” the agency said, “is designed to improve drug safety and accelerate the evaluation process, while reducing animal experimentation, lowering research and development (R&D) costs, and ultimately, drug prices.” Separately, EPA spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou told the Washington Examiner in a statement on Thursday the EPA “is wholly committed to getting the agency back on track to eliminating animal testing.”
As a former NASA engineer turned physician, I have the highest regard for evidence-backed decision making. The move by these two federal agencies to minimize animal testing in favor of human-focused models makes perfect scientific sense and ultimately will benefit patients by getting new pharmaceuticals and therapies to the market sooner and in a more cost-effective manner.
Animal testing is outdated. It is tedious, expensive and oftentimes produces data that doesn’t translate to human health. Experimental methods that don’t use animals, like tissue chips and computational models, lead to the development of safer and more effective therapies and pharmaceuticals.
In addition to benefits to human health, human-centric research approaches save animal lives and prevent their suffering.
My perspective is not unique.
A recent survey shows the vast majority of Americans are in favor of phasing out animal experiments.
A September 2024 Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine/Morning Consult poll of more than 2,000 asked for agreement levels to the statement “The US government should commit to a plan to phase out experiments on animals.” Eighty percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed. This represents a shift from a 2018 Pew Research Center study that found that 47% of Americans were in favor of using animals in scientific research labs and 52% opposed it.
In my lifestyle medicine practice, I work with patients to prevent and reverse chronic disease through diet, movement, and stress management. Often, my patients are able to come off of medications. But when pharmaceuticals are needed, I want to ensure they’re safe, effective, and fairly priced. To those points, the federal government’s recent moves to begin phasing out animal testing is a big step in the right direction.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-95011864-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-04-16 20:07:54.926289

Mike Kehoe’s plan to rapidly enlarge a scholarship program for private and religious schools with an infusion of state tax funds was cut out of the budget Wednesday as the Senate Appropriations Committee finished revising spending plans for the coming year.
The $50 million request for the MoScholars program, which is supposed to be funded from donations and tax credits, was approved in the Missouri House as part of its budget proposal. But state Sen. Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, stripped it out after boosting the foundation formula for public schools by $300 million the day before.
“I want to make sure that we’re fully funding our obligation to public schools before we start spending 10s of millions of general revenue dollars on private schools,” Hough told reporters after making the cut.
In his State of the State speech to lawmakers in January, Kehoe said he was not funding the foundation formula to the level directed by state law because it no longer fairly distributes the money. The extra money for the scholarship program, he said, would give parents more educational choices.
Public schools come first, Hough said Wednesday.
Kehoe “admitted we’re not funding K-12 to the level that it’s supposed to be funded.” Hough said. “And I think that’s an obligation that we have, especially when we have the money in the bank.”
Missouri has a healthy general revenue surplus, with $3.7 billion in the fund on March 31. There is another $1.5 billion that, like general revenue, is unrestricted. But revenue is declining in the current fiscal year and, while modest growth is projected for the future, the budget being prepared now will use at least $1.6 billion from the surplus.
The budget is based on a projection of $13.6 billion in general revenue. Kehoe proposed spending almost $16 billion, including construction and maintenance funding, and the House budget plan uses $15.2 billion.
The exact totals for the 13 budget bills funding state operations approved by the committee were not available Wednesday. But with the extra money for public schools, plus $107 million for child care subsidies and dozens of new earmarks, the total is sure to be substantially higher than the $47.9 billion from all funds approved in the House and could exceed the $50.1 billion total in Kehoe’s proposal.
Three more bills spending another $3.7 billion for construction and maintenance are awaiting a final House vote before the Senate committee can make its changes.
The greatest uncertainty for the upcoming year is whether substantial cuts will be made to federal spending. The largest single shared program is Medicaid, with Missouri paying 10- to 35% of the cost for each person enrolled and the federal treasury covering the rest.
The group made eligible by a 2020 constitutional amendment costs the state the least, only 10% of the expense. So far, Missouri has not spent any general revenue on the expanded group, using other sources of money, including federal aid banked during the COVID pandemic.
If Missouri were required to pay 20% of the cost, it would have to find $300 million to keep it in place for the 350,000 enrollees.
Hough has been warning that federal cuts could upset Missouri’s budget. But on Wednesday, he said the committee can only write a budget based on what is currently in place.
“To the extent that we can, we plan for this kind of stuff,” Hough said. “But how do you plan for a Medicaid reimbursement on an expanded population that goes down by, say, say, 20% and costs us $600 million?”
The $50 million cut to the scholarship line was the largest cut of the day but not the only one. The Senate committee took out $10 million the House included to hire an architect to prepare plans for expanding the Capitol. Another set of cuts targeted some of the earmarked items approved in the House.
And cuts were used to express lingering resentment for the factionalism that fractured Republicans in the state Senate for four years. State Sen. Mike Cierpiot of Lee’s Summit cut 25 employees and $684,000 from Secretary of State Denny Hoskins’ budget, noting that the positions had been open for a long time and the office seems to function acceptably without them.
Hoskins was a member of the Freedom Caucus, which repeatedly tied the Senate up in filibusters to push its brand of Republicanism. And as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, he argued often against retaining employee authorizations that departments were unable to fill within six to 12 months.
Hoskins, inaugurated in January, is authorized to employ 267 full time staff. During the fiscal year that ended June 30, his predecessor, Jay Ashcroft, used 205 of that amount.
Hoskins said he needs to study each position in his to determine if it is needed if the cut is made. 
“I will comply with whatever they do,” he said.
Hough said he had no objections to cutting the unfilled positions. 
“Sen. Hoskins, when he was on this committee with us,” Hough said, “was always kind of a hawk on that stuff.”

John Payton, R-Wilburn, present a proposed constitutional amendment to affirm Arkansans' right to keep and bear arms to the House Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs on Monday, April 14, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Three proposed constitutional amendments are expected to appear on Arkansas voters’ 2026 ballots after receiving legislative approval this week.
The House and Senate approved three Republican-led measures and sent them to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ desk:

A proposal to affirm that the right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution “is a natural, fundamental, and individual right that shall not be infringed.”
A proposal to allow the Legislature to create economic development districts throughout the state
The Citizens Only Voting Amendment, to affirm that only U.S. citizens can vote in Arkansas, which is already the law

All three proposals received approval from the House and Senate Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs before each chamber voted on them.
The Legislature is allowed to refer a maximum of three amendments to voters during every regular session. Lawmakers referred only one measure to the 2024 ballot, a proposal for trade-school students to be eligible for scholarship lottery funds, which voters overwhelmingly approved in November.
The proposal pertaining to gun rights would alter the portion of the Arkansas Constitution that echoes the federal Second Amendment. The concise language of the amendment would clarify that the right to keep and bear arms extends to “the possession and use of” ammunition, firearm accessories and firearm components.
The proposed amendment did not generate discussion on the Senate floor last week or on the House floor Tuesday. House sponsor Rep. Matt Duffield, R-Russellville, gave an eight-minute speech encouraging his colleagues to support the measure.
“At the end of the day, the Second Amendment and our own right to keep and bear arms in the Arkansas Constitution is not about hunting, it’s not about sport-shooting and it’s not about self-protection,” Duffield said Tuesday. “It’s about a citizen’s last line of defense against tyranny, and it’s part of our nation’s DNA.”

Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, was the Senate sponsor of the amendments pertaining to firearms and noncitizen voting. Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, sponsored the Citizens Only Voting Amendment and told the House on April 7 that language in state constitutions that say “every citizen” or “any citizen” can vote is “a floor rather than a ceiling.”
“[Existing language] protects your right and my right as a citizen, but it’s insufficient because it leaves room for other people to be added to that list,” Ray said.
Noncitizen voting is already illegal in federal elections. Noncitizen voting in local elections is rare nationwide, but it has been legalized in a handful of cities, leading to backlash from conservatives.
House Bill 1422, another proposed measure to further ensure citizens do not vote in Arkansas, failed in the House in March. The bill needed 67 House votes because part of it would have amended the state Constitution, and 53 Republicans supported the bill while 14 more did not vote.
Rep. Diana Gonzales Worthen, D-Springdale, expressed opposition to both the bill that failed and the proposed amendment that passed. She told her colleagues both times that noncitizens do not attempt to vote because it would cost them their path to U.S. citizenship.
Thirteen states — including Louisiana, Oklahoma and Missouri — have amended their constitutions since 2020 to specify that noncitizens cannot vote in those states.
The amendments pertaining to noncitizen voting and gun rights passed the House and Senate mostly along party lines, while the economic development amendment had bipartisan support in both chambers.
This proposed amendment defines an economic development district as “a designated area within a city, county, or cooperative area established under authority granted by the General Assembly to promote economic development.” Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, introduced the measure in the Senate.

“What we’re trying to do is level the playing field with our neighboring states,” House sponsor Rep. Howard Beaty, R-Crossett, told his colleagues Wednesday. “…It’s going to allow direct local incentives to be made, potentially for retail, for housing, to clean up blight in your communities, and it’s going to have the ability for local control, where your local communities can decide what’s important to them.”
The proposed amendment generated 45 minutes of debate on the House floor. Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, said she disliked that the proposal says “loans and grants of public money” will support economic development projects.
“The taxpayer is who this will roll down the hill upon if it should fail,” Lundstrum said. “I think this particular idea needs more vetting and more time.”
Rep. Carol Dalby, R-Texarkana, expressed support for the measure.
“You come through Texarkana, you cross that state line and you see the economic development that happens in Texas,” Dalby said. “It’s not for lack of trying [in] Texarkana, Arkansas or Miller County, Arkansas. I guarantee you we fight constantly to get things into our district, and here’s what we hear all the time: ‘I can go across the state line and I can get a better deal.”

Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.

But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.

The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.

Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.

Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.

Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”

Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.










There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher


Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

HB 246, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, drew criticism from people who identify as transgender or nonbinary at a public hearing earlier this month. The bill would give public educators legal immunity and students immunity from discipline for using a person’s legal name and pronouns aligned with their reproductive organs, instead of the name and gender with which they identify.

Susan Dubose, R-Hoover, who read the substitute, said.
The committee adopted a substitute that added pronouns or names “patently inconsistent” with a student’s biological sex. The legislation requires students to get a permission slip signed by their parents if they use pronouns that do not reflect their biological sex.

Operating on approximately one third of a percent of the state budget’s General Fund, about $120 million, Nessel said in 2024 the department won more than $500 million in court for Michiganders.

Nessel went on to say her office has obtained 11 settlements over her six-and-a-half-year tenure in its efforts to hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable for the opioid epidemic, which has resulted in thousands of overdoses in Michigan since 2000. These settlements have awarded $1.64 billion to the state to be distributed through local government and statewide government programs.
While there’s a lot of negative commentary regarding government employees, Nessel said, alluding to President Donald Trump’s executive actions to trim down the federal workforce and eliminate “bloat”, Nessel said her staff work tirelessly to improve the lives of Michiganders.
From educating elderly Michiganders on scams to investigating long-overlooked cases of missing and murdered indigenous residents, Nessel touted the work her office has done, including facilitating 315 individuals to enroll in the state’s Address Confidentiality Program to shield the addresses of those who have experienced domestic and sexual violence and stalking.
But it’s not just the Attorney General’s Office that is charged with helping Michiganders find justice, Nessel said, noting that county prosecutors play an instrumental role in the state’s justice system as the state faces a shortage of prosecutors amid staffing shortages and underfunding.
And now county prosecutor’s offices across Michigan face the task of reviewing hundreds of murder cases in a 180 day window after the Michigan Supreme Court eliminated mandatory life sentences without parole for 19- and 20-year-olds last week. The time schedule prescribed by the state court is “insanely short” Nessel said and will take an immense amount of effort from prosecutors to handle resentencings.
House Appropriations Committee Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Twp.) has proposed cutbacks in the state budget for the Michigan Supreme Court and the State Court Administrative Office to invest into county prosecutors’ offices to address the workload.

“If the Michigan Supreme Court wants to upend the justice system and force communities to relive horrific crimes, they’re going to have to tighten their budget,” Bollin said in a news release Monday. “I’m going to make sure the people doing the real work — our local prosecutors — have the resources they need to keep dangerous criminals behind bars and fight for justice on behalf of victims and their families.”
It’s hard to explain the breadth of what the Supreme Court’s decision will mean for Michiganders, Nessel said. Beyond the “excruciating” experience for families of deceased victims during resentencing, cases will have to be revisited from decades ago and the effort it takes to rebuild a file will consume prosecutors’ offices.
“I hope when you’re formulating your budget, you just keep that in mind as to just how much work goes into that and how important it is for these types of cases, the most important kinds of cases where a person lost their life, so my hope is that you will consider that,” Nessel said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-16-at-5.04.04-PM-1024x579.png,,,2025-04-16 19:07:40.724124

The foundation records were posted online the same day that news emerged that Erik Dellenback, who has been executive director of Hope Florida since January, is stepping down from his post in the governor’s office. Dellenback, who remains chair of Florida Faith and Community Advisory Council, did not mention his pending resignation when he testified in a House hearing this week.
Hope Florida is an initiative launched by First Lady Casey DeSantis to help steer people off public assistance programs. The foundation’s finances have come under scrutiny by the Florida House. Gov. DeSantis has criticized the probe as a “hoax” even as some House Republicans have questioned the legality of some transactions involving the Hope Florida Foundation, the program’s direct-support organization.
News of Dellenbeck’s resignation, first reported by Florida Politics, came as the Hope Florida Foundation made available its IRS form 990 for Aug. 25, 2023, through June 30, 2024, listing nine entities that made contributions. 
Hope Florida Foundation president Joshua Hay acknowledged this week that work on these tax documents did not begin until just a few weeks ago.
Ron DeSantis’ motto?
House Speaker Daniel Perez told reporters Wednesday that the chamber’s probe into Hope Florida wouldn’t end when the legislative session is scheduled to wrap up on May 2.
“It is very clear by what has been put out there that Hope Florida could have been run better. That maybe transparency would be a benefit for Hope Florida. [The governor] refuses to acknowledge that; at least the chair of Hope Florida had the courage to do so,” Perez said. “Why is it that everyone around him has to abide by a certain set of rules?
“Rules for thee but not for me. That seems to be the motto of Ron DeSantis today.”
The board of directors will meet virtually Thursday to discuss the documents, which include bylaws and other material routinely associated with not-for-profit organizations. The board is also slated to discuss the state of the organization, its corporate governance, finances, public records, and public meeting laws, all to ensure it is furthering its mission and the Department of Children and Families’ priorities. That’s one of several agencies through which Hope Florida operates.
IRS Form 990 is the federal government’s tool for gathering information about tax-exempt organizations and is required to be submitted annually.
Medicaid managed care connection
The IRS Form 990 shows that the foundation had $809,293 cash on hand at the end of the reporting period.

Two state-contracted Medicaid managed care plans that were vying for lucrative new contracts made contributions to the Hope Florida Foundation. The contracts are the largest of their kind for the state and, according to the House of Representatives, the managed care plans will be paid $143 billion over the next six years to provide health care to the state’s poor, elderly, and disabled who rely on Medicaid for their health care.
The tax form shows that the Hope Florida Foundation received contributions from Simply Healthcare Plans and Centene, which contributed $98,408 and $95,223, respectively.
The state Agency for Health Care Administration announced plans to award new contracts in April and a second round of announcements in July. The decisions expanded statewide Simply Healthcare’s footprint in the Medicaid managed care marketplace. The new contracts have a requirement for the plans to work with Hope Florida and to report information about their members to Hope Florida. 
Meanwhile, the St. Joe Community Foundation made the largest contribution, according to the tax form: $200,000. The second largest contribution ($123,408) came from Tampa Electric Co.
Tidal Basin Government Consulting contributed $48,408; The Steven and Natalle Herring Family Foundation contributed $100,000; Lennar Foundation Inc. contributed $46,815; Gray Robinson contributed $23,408; and Baldwin Risk Partners contributed $25,000.

Second Centene payment
That was the first of at least two contributions health care giant Centene made to the foundation. In September 2024, Centene made a one-time $10 million “donation” to the Hope Florida Foundation, first disclosed by former Department of Children and Families Secretary Shevaun Harris during a House Health Care Budget Subcommittee meeting earlier this month. 
The $10 million was part of a larger settlement the Medicaid managed care plan signed with the state to resolve overpayments for pharmacy benefits and services.
The foundation channeled the $10 million to two groups that turned around and contributed to another group battling last year’s initiative on recreational marijuana. The DeSantis administration organized opposition to that and the abortion-rights amendment using state resources. Both proposals were broadly popular but fell narrowly short of the required 60% approval rate.
DeSantis’ anti-pot committee, Keep Florida Clean, was run by James Uthmeier, then DeSantis’ chief of staff, whom the governor subsequently appointed as state attorney general following Ashley Moody’s departure for the U.S. Senate.
Dellenback’s connection to faith office, anti-abortion campaign 
‘I represent government,’ DeSantis appointee says during event against abortion amendment

Scrutiny over Hope Florida also surfaced in the Senate the day before Dellenback’s resignation became public. Senators expressed doubts Tuesday about advancing a proposal, SB 820, formalizing in statute the Office of Faith and Community, which Dellenback also led.
Both Democrats and Republicans raised concerns about the connection between Hope Florida and the Governor’s Faith and Community Initiative through Dellenback’s leadership.
Senate Democratic Leader Jason Pizzo pointed out Dellenback’s involvement in both programs during the Tuesday meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Agriculture, Environment, and General Government.
“I don’t dislike it enough to vote no on it, but I am very concerned. I think we need to think carefully now that more information has come forward in this own committee meeting,” Winter Haven Republican Sen. Colleen Burton said. “I think we need to be very, very careful that if we do enshrine this in statute, that this office stands on its own two feet, that it’s not associated with other organizations.”
The House companion to that bill, HB 293, is scheduled for its final committee hearing on Thursday. 
Before the election, Dellenback joined Florida Family Voice’s tour throughout the state advocating against the passage of the ballot initiative to protect abortion access in the state constitution. 
During the Tallahassee stop of the anti-abortion tour, Dellenback thanked the people on behalf of the governor and first lady.
“Tonight, I represent government, but I have spent way more time as a faith person than I have as a government person. And this was a biblical issue before it was a political issue,” Dellenback told the crowd of nearly 100 people at Four Oaks Community Church in Killearn, a capital city suburb.

(Courtesy of the University of Idaho)A University of Idaho grant to help Idaho farmers develop climate-smart practices has been terminated. 
The $59 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program was the largest in the university’s history. 
Established under the Biden administration, it would have funded the university’s Innovative Agriculture and Marketing Partnership project, which opened applications earlier this year. It was a statewide project that would have paid farmers to incorporate practices that reduced the climate impact within Idaho’s top commodities including potatoes, sugar beets, wheat, barley, hops, chickpeas and beef.
As of March, 201 Idaho producers representing 27 Idaho counties had applied for the grant, according to a press release from the university on Wednesday.
But the grant was terminated as the USDA changed its criteria to evaluate climate-smart grants, referred to as “Farmer First” policy priorities. The new criteria asks that 65% of grant funds go directly to farmers. While more than 50% of the university’s proposal went toward payment to farmers — with the remaining funds going toward technical and marketing services for farmers — the project no longer qualifies for the grant under the new criteria. 
The USDA is rebranding the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program, which it called in a press release a “Biden era climate slush fund,” as the Advancing Markets for Producers initiative. 
The University of Idaho has the opportunity to resubmit a proposal by June 20 with adjustments to meet the new criteria. 
“While we are disappointed by the USDA decision to terminate the IAMP grant, we are thankful for the opportunity to resubmit our proposal,” co-director of the program Sanford Eigenbrode said in a press release. “The objectives of the IAMP project are in line with the expected guidelines from (the USDA) and their Farmer First priorities, and we are in a good position to reconfigure the project to meet those guidelines.” 
The USDA committed to honoring all eligible expenses incurred prior to April 13. The University of Idaho said it is in contact with its implementing partners and several producers to ensure any eligible expenses incurred prior to this date are reimbursed.

The Montana Legislature approved raising nonresident fees to purchase bonus raffle points for a coveted Smith River permit, funding maintenance along the scenic corridor and purportedly giving a slight edge toward resident floaters .
Located in central Montana, flowing north through the Big Belt Mountains toward Great Falls, the Smith River — a 59-mile stretch of which is officially Smith River State Park — is the only river in Montana that requires a permit for all recreational access.
Sen. Laura Smith, D-Helena, said the increasing popularity of the Smith River and the effects of compounded use, were reasons she brought Senate Bill 257.
The secluded stretch of river is so popular that the lottery system sees more than 20,000 individuals enter each year, with roughly 1,200 permits available. Of that, nonresidents can only receive 10% of available permits.
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks operates the permitting lottery with a bonus point system — applicants pay to enter the lottery and each year can purchase an additional bonus point to increase their chances of being selected. Bonus points can accumulate each year an applicant doesn’t draw a permit and the points are squared during the drawing.
Smith’s bill more than doubles the cost of bonus points for out-of-state individuals, from $50 to $125, while resident’s pay just $5.
“When I was door knocking, one things folks talked about in addition to public lands was Smith River permits. They were talking about the fact that people weren’t really pulling the permit, and so I looked at the bonus point system and what the money goes to,” Smith told the Senate Fish and Game Committee in February.
Revenue from the bonus point system goes into the state’s Smith River Enhancement Account, to “protect and enhance the integrity of the natural and scenic beauty of the Smith River waterway and its recreational, fisheries, and wildlife values.”
“Because of the increased foot traffic, in and out use, some of the funds have been used to improve the put in and put out,” Smith told the committee. “Ten years ago, when my now husband and I floated it, we used to camp at the put in. They said the impact at the bank, with so many people putting into the river there, really eroded those river banks. So they used this money to restore the put in and take out.”
According to the bill’s fiscal note, 1,114 nonresident bonus points were sold in 2024, and under the new fee structure would provide a more than $83,000 boost to revenue.
Revenue from the account has also been used to work on waste disposal systems along the river — which has no public access along its 59-mile stretch — and to purchase or lease adjacent land.
“The money goes to good causes that preserve the integrity of the river,” Smith said.
Trout Unlimited, the Montana Wildlife Federation and several individuals, including fishing guides, supported the legislation in committee hearings.
The bill sailed through the Senate with just four votes in opposition. The bill was unanimously concurred in the House on 2nd reading, but drew two nay votes on the final vote Wednesday.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/smithriverpaddle.jpg,,,2025-04-16 19:07:40.724124

(Gavel photo by Getty Images; seal courtesy the State of Iowa)The House Government Oversight Committee questioned officials from the Iowa Judicial Branch and State Court Administration Wednesday while investigating the misallocation of $27.5 million in court debt funds caused by programming errors.
Committee members heard testimony and asked questions of State Court Administrator Robert Gast, Iowa Judicial Branch attorney Amber Shanahan-Fricke and Caitlin Jarzen, the branch’s director of government affairs, about how errors in the programming used for court fine distributions that resulted in misappropriated money.
In 2020 and 2021, state lawmakers passed legislation that “significantly modified how court debt is collected and distributed,” judicial branch staff said in an October statement. Reprogramming the judicial branch’s case management system for these changes resulted in programming errors, according to the statement, which in turn resulted in incorrect distributions of court debt funds.
According to a December 2024 report by Auditor Rob Sand, the errors caused seven state funds, including the Victim Compensation Fund, to be underfunded between fiscal years 2021 through 2024, while the state’s general fund and two other funds received over-allocations.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
During the meeting, lawmakers criticized the Judicial Branch for not sharing information on the error and resulting misallocations with lawmakers until a significant period of time had passed after the problem was identified. In October 2024, House Speaker Pat Grassley and Iowa Department of Management Director Kraig Paulsen sent letters to Sand criticizing the auditor’s office for not taking action on the issue earlier, as the auditor’s office was alerted of financial irregularities in 2022 by the state Department of Transportation.
Sand, the only Democrat to hold statewide elected office in Iowa, and state GOP leaders had criticized one another for responsibility of investigating and addressing the impacts of the misallocations in 2024. But at the House committee meeting Wednesday, lawmakers said it is a bipartisan effort to ensure this issue is addressed and similar errors do not occur. Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, said the issue is “not partisan at all,” and the Legislature should be working together to find ways to fix the issue and attempt to simplify Iowa Code to prevent future errors.
“I ask that we collectively try to find ways — maybe there’s other states that do it better, maybe there’s a way we can make it home grown — but I ask that we collectively, in a bipartisan fashion, in a nonpartisan fashion, find solutions going forward,” Baeth said.
Gast, the court administrator, said in a December 2024 letter the judicial branch had implemented corrections to the programming errors in the case management system as of Nov. 22. He said in the letter the branch had contracted with a third party — Zirous, a West Des Moines information technology firm — to review and audit the new programming. He also told the committee the judicial branch was developing an internal auditing process for future programming changes.
Addressing questions from lawmakers on why the Legislature and other state entities were not informed earlier about the issues, Gast said delays in releasing information came as the process for working with a national consulting group to identify the errors took longer than expected.
“We wanted to have the full scope and breadth before we came to you and not come in, and (say) ‘the sky is falling!’ and not have some idea of what we were looking at,” Gast said.
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, a lawyer, said he had doubts about the judicial branch’s response on sharing certain emails and communications about the errors, and the timelines it would take to receive this information.
“I’ve practiced for 38 years and I know malarkey when I see it, and I know malarkey discovery responses when I see them,” Thomson said.
Court officials said they are willing to share information, and asked lawmakers to submit their requests in writing with time periods, involved parties and search terms specified.
Gast and Shanahan-Fricke said the judicial branch plans to present a technical bill next year that will keep the percentages of debt distribution in line with what the Legislature intended in previous bills, but would create a new framework for distributing the money that would address these errors.
“Along with the changes we’ve implemented internally on how we move forward on programming, and especially financial programming, I believe with what we’ve done in that bill, we will be able to put this to bed,” Gast said.

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.

The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

 
 
DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.

Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
 Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.

Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
 Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.










There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher


Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

StebbinsAs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or USACE, continues to prepare the draft of its long-awaited environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project; the Corps confirmed on Wednesday that its evaluation would move forward on a shortened timeline following an executive order from President Donald Trump. 
The project would replace a four-mile section of the pipeline in the Straits of Mackinac with a new segment located in a concrete-lined tunnel beneath the lakebed, intended to contain any potential spills from the pipeline.

However, Native American Tribes and environmental activists have long argued the pipeline poses too much of a threat to continue operating in the Straits — where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet — as tribal nations and environmental organizations have brought forth several legal challenges against the project, raising concerns about the impacts of both constructing the tunnel and allowing Line 5 to continue operating. 
In order to move forward with construction, Enbridge Energy, the Canadian company that owns the pipeline, must secure permits from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission and the Army Corps of Engineers. 
As part of its permitting review, the Corps must issue an environmental impact statement examining the natural, cultural and human environment before making its permitting decision. In 2023, the Army Corps of Engineers announced it would extend its review for the statement, with plans to issue a draft statement in 2025 and a final decision expected in early 2026. However, a decision could come much sooner following an order from President Trump instructing the United States Army Corps of Engineers to exercise emergency permitting power to facilitate the nation’s energy supply.
Following Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order which declared a national energy emergency in order to boost fossil fuel production, many Line 5 opponents warned that the order could impact the Corps’ review of the tunnel project. 
After several indications that the Line 5 tunnel would receive expedited processing, members of the Corps confirmed on Wednesday that the project would be reviewed under emergency procedures. 
While members of the Corps could not offer an updated timeline for the project, Shane McCoy, the regulatory chief for the USACE’s Detroit District told reporters on Wednesday the draft environmental impact statement would most likely be released in June. 
Though the timeline for the project has been shortened, McCoy said the emergency procedures would not eliminate any steps from the review, later telling reporters, “We have full confidence that we will be making the decision based on the best information available.”

“The truncated process will result in a very legally defensible and very well informed decision in our record of decision,” McCoy said. 
McCoy also emphasized that the decision on whether to permit the project would not be determined prior to the completion of its analysis and all required consultations and coordinations. However, Whitney Gravelle, president of the Bay Mills Indian Community, said she didn’t believe that. 
On March 21, the Bay Mills Indian Community alongside the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi sent a letter to the USACE, withdrawing their participation as cooperating agencies in drafting the environmental impact statement due to the expectation that the project would soon receive permitting due to Trump’s executive order. The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians similarly withdrew from talks with the USACE on March 26. 
While USACE Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff said tribal input helped shape and refine cultural resource surveys and reports and the consideration of cultural resources in the Corps of Engineers review, Gravelle said the process was inherently flawed, and that they had repeatedly submitted comments, data and scientific fact that was ignored. 
Despite the departure of the seven tribes participating as cooperating agencies, the USACE told reporters it continues to consult with them, as well as 13 other tribal nations. 
While the Corps determined Enbridge’s permit request met the definition of Trump’s emergency order, Gravelle said she’d like to know where the emergency is. 
“Emergency measures are in place for things like flooding or wildfires or loss of life and property, and how would Line 5 impact anyone in any way,” Gravelle said pointing to the Edenville Dam failure and Enbridge’s 2010 oil spill in the Kalamazoo River as recent examples of emergency permitting within the state. 
Should the project move forward, it would have detrimental harm to an already vulnerable population of white fish and lake trout in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, which would reduce tribal fishing in the Straits, Gravelle said.

In 1836, the Anishinaabe signed the Treaty of Washington, ceding nearly 14 million acres of land to settlers. In return, Anishinaabe peoples would retain the right to hunt, fish and gather within the ceded territory. 
“We’ve shared evidence with them. Locations of, you know, fish spawning beds in both of the lakes, we’ve shared with them  cultural historic properties, both on the North and the South Shore…. we’re trying to not only prevent future harm, but we’re also trying to protect and preserve what we have now,” Gravelle said. 
“And nobody hears that right? Like nobody can understand the importance of tribal treaty rights, because when they think of treaty rights, they just think of someone going out and catching a fish. And they don’t realize that this is tied to teachings that you get from your parents on where to fish and how to fish, and then, you know, teachings that you get from your elders when you have fish at ceremony, or teachings on how to interact with the landscape, or like, why do we fish during these seasons, but not during the other seasons. It’s all interwoven into our Indigenous way of life,” Gravelle said. 
In a statement responding to the USACE’s notice, Gravelle’s message was simple: “We will continue to defend the rights of the Great Lakes. See you in court.”
“That’s exactly how I feel,” Gravelle told the Michigan Advance. “We have been setting ourselves up and positioning ourselves now that we will fight for our rights before the court, and we will do it not only on behalf of tribes, but on behalf of the rest of the Great Lakes.” 
When asked what the community was looking to challenge, Gravelle said all options were on the table, down to the executive order and the determination that the project meets emergency permitting criteria. 
“When you are threatening tribes and tribal people and our community’s way of life, there’s nothing to do, but left to fight and to fight, so that we can continue to exist,” Gravelle said. 
As the Army Corps of Engineers moves forward with its review, the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and the Michigan Public Service Commission have already granted the project its necessary permits. 
However, the The Bay Mills Indian Community, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, and the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi alongside Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Michigan Climate Action Network have sought leave to appeal the Public Service Commission’s decision to the Supreme Court, after a previous court upheld the Commission’s decision. The Great Lakes water advocacy group For Love of Water — or FLOW — has filed a separate application aiming to appeal the case.

Additionally Enbridge must redo its water resources permit as part of a legal agreement with EGLE and the Bay Mills Indian Community. EGLE Strategic Communications Advisor Scott Dean told the Michigan Advance on April 3 that EGLE is currently reviewing two applications for construction activities related to the tunnel, including a joint permitting application covering its Wetlands Protection and Great Lakes Bottomlands permits.
EGLE is also considering Enbridge’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, with its current permit set to expire on Oct. 1, 2025. The permit aims to protect water quality by limiting the amount of pollutants that can be discharged into a body of water.
Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy referenced a previous statement when asked about the USACE’s shortened permitting pathway, calling the pipeline “critical energy infrastructure” 
“In 2021 the State of Michigan issued its environmental permits for the tunnel project, and in 2023 the Michigan Public Service Commission approved placing the new pipeline segment in the tunnel as Line 5 crosses the Straits of Mackinac. However, the project still awaits action by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on an environmental impact statement and a permitting decision,” Duffy said, adding that the company had reapplied for permits from EGLE which were set to expire in 2026.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC_04072-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 19:07:40.724124

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The Senate Taxation Committee made headway on the property tax debate by moving several bills originating in the House through the committee on Wednesday morning, despite reservations by several legislators.
Gov. Greg Gianforte’s favored bill, House Bill 231, brought by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad,  moved on, as did House Bill 155, which has become a flagship bill from Democrats in both chambers. Some Republicans also feel rebates are the way to provide tax relief, while the HB 231 camp and the Democrats try and adjust tax rates.
House Bill 528, which was a late, under-the-radar and bipartisan bill from Rep. Ed Bryne, R-Bigfork, was tabled in the committee.
A motion to reconsider House Bill 154, a renter tax credit Democrats had previously hinted wasn’t dead, also failed to move to the floor. Senate Bill 90, a bill favored by Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, and conservative members of his caucus, continues to hang around as a property tax option in the House.
SB 90 is a tax rebate that Democrats say does not provide enough relief. SB 90 has been added to HB 924, which includes a property tax credit. That legislation that would create a $1 billion trust that serves multiple interests, including childcare, infrastructure and disaster resilience. 
“Senate Bill 90 is alive and well,” Sen. Greg Hertz, chair of Senate Taxation said during the meeting.
His words were foreshadowing — Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings made a reconsideration motion on SB 90 during the House’s floor session. Around a dozen House members rose to speak during discussion on the blast motion, which ultimately failed by one vote.
The committee made several amendments on both HB 155 and HB 231. For HB 155, brought by Rep. Mark Thane, D-Missoula, the amendment included language to roll back property tax rates to 2024 and provide a homestead exemption on the first $50,000 of a home, bringing some Democrats into opposition because of those changes.
“155 now is different. It’s changed,” Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena said during the meeting. “I went from a yes to a no. It’s changed that much.”
Amendments to HB 231 included pushing the effective date back, as the bill was originally looking to be passed in March, and adding language to help fix a major hurdle for much of the property tax legislation — issues with charters in several cities that could see an increase local property taxes with the bill as introduced.
Language in HB 231 was amended to give local governments the option to switch from a mill-based levy to a dollar-based levy should they so choose.
There was also some debate over whether reimbursing cities with charters that conflict with state money could be a realistic option. Hertz said he thinks telling cities to ignore their charters is unconstitutional and had little doubt it would be challenged in court. 
HB 155 and HB 231 will now head to the Senate floor for the full Senate to consider. Property taxes remain a major hurdle for the Legislature as the end of the session nears and Montanans face another jump in property values.
“I committed to Representative Jones to get this bill out of here,” Hertz said of HB 231. “I don’t like it. It’s more or less a Frankenstein bill now, but I hope we can get this bill out of here so we can have the discussion on the floor.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Senate_door_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 18:09:41.757591

Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka, and Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton, react to new forecast data projecting $2 billion less in state revenue on April 16, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)In a sharp turnaround from the flush financial fortunes of the last budget cycle, Indiana’s projected revenue for the next budget cycle fell by $2 billion according to new forecast data publicized on Wednesday. 
The current budget cycle for the 2025 fiscal year is also short by an estimated $400 million, though closing that gap will likely rely on reserves. 
Indiana’s tax revenue is still growing but not at the rate anticipated.
According to chief budget architects Sen. Ryan Mishler and Rep. Jeff Thompson, “everything is on the table” when it comes to potential cuts. 
  Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton, on April 4, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“We just have a lot of tough decisions to make and we have to be disciplined,” said Mishler, R-Mishawaka. “… K-12 education is the last thing we want to do anything with so I would prefer to put everything else in front of that.”
When it came to increasing so-called sin taxes — whether on gaming, cigarettes or alcohol, Thompson didn’t rule it out. 
“All of those things have to be discussed,” said the Lizton Republican. 
For longtime lawmakers, the news invoked memories of budgeting after the 2008 recession, when the state weathered more than a billion-dollar shortfall. 
“This one scares me a lot more because the number is a lot higher. And back then, if you remember, we had federal money to backfill. We don’t have any federal money to backfill. This is all on us,” said Mishler. “So we’re going to have to live within our means.”
With a goal to finish the 2025 legislative session next week, lawmakers don’t have much time to identify potential cuts — though the two Republicans anticipated long nights ahead to meet that preferred deadline.
Democrats pointed to the need to protect Hoosiers during uncertain economic times and minimizing harm through state resources.  
“We are extremely concerned for Hoosiers across the state, because the same underlying conditions that are impacting the state budget are impacting Hoosiers,” said Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis. “From the price of goods and services to the challenges of those who rely on retirement funds to small businesses relying on their products that they ship.”
Qaddoura noted that Senate Democrats had pushed to incorporate sin taxes into the budget earlier in the week, adding that a $2 cigarette tax increase would bring in an estimated $800 million. 
Moments after release of the downgraded forecast, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce called for the General Assembly to pull the trigger on that tax.
“A big action still on the table this legislative session is a minimum $2 per pack increase to the cigarette tax,” said President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders. “We urge lawmakers to put the increase in the state budget – both for the positive impact on the health of Hoosiers who smoke and the additional revenue.”
 What happened?

The December forecast data included roughly $800 million in new revenue for the state over the next two years, though nearly all of that came in the first year. Now even that marginal growth is gone. 
Much of the loss can be attributed to economic uncertainty, including worries about the impact of tariffs in the country’s most manufacturing-intensive state. 
“When the U.S. gets a cold, Indiana gets pneumonia,” said Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis. “We’re a manufacturing state and (with) the tariffs and other issues out there in the federal government … this really affects our bottom line.”

According to an analysis from Axios Indianapolis, Indiana is the third-most reliant state when it comes to China, which imported $6.1 billion in Hoosier goods in 2023. More than half of that was in pharmaceuticals and medicines followed by oilseeds and grains. 
Democrats pointed to potential areas for savings, including pushing back anticipated income tax cuts and clawing back money from the Indiana Economic Development Corporation. 
Qaddoura went even further, targeting the use of vouchers by wealthy families to attend private schools.
“I think if we’re looking at K-12 cuts, we definitely need to look at reversing the voucher program back to the 2021 level to be sure that the ultra-wealthy are not benefiting while we’re cutting … funding for K-12 education across the state,” he said. 
He said such a move would save an estimated $309 million. 
Potentially the biggest bill in the 2025 session altered property taxes with an explicit goal to give two-thirds of homeowners relief, at a loss for local units of governments and school corporations. 
Thompson said that effort, which has been signed into law, doesn’t need to be revisited in light of the news about the state’s finances. 
“I can tell you right now that the Indiana projected revenue is probably less than most locals. We’re probably in a tougher spot than they are,” Thompson said.
Gov. Mike Braun focused  on cutting waste, eliminating overhead, and getting back to the basics.
“We must finalize a biennial budget that respects the revenue forecast and protects Hoosier taxpayers from a worst-case scenario,” he said. “I will work with the General Assembly to craft a budget that is structurally balanced, maintains strong reserves, and funds vital services like public safety and education.”
 What about Medicaid?

In a small spot of positive news, Mishler noted that the growth of Medicaid appeared to be slowing. 
Medicaid rolls were just over 1% lower than previously estimated, a difference of less than 30,000 Hoosiers. More than 2 million residents rely on the program for their health care coverage. 
Breaking down budgets: Why Medicaid expenses are growing

But, as an entitlement program, much of the program can’t be cut — meaning that the state will likely remain committed to spending roughly $10 billion over the next two years. 
“We’re trying to make some changes to try to help us in the Medicaid space,” said Mishler, pointing to his efforts under Senate Bill 2. 
However, much remains uncertain about Medicaid’s future, especially with several large pieces of legislation still up in the air. 
Under Mishler’s bill, most able-bodied working-age adults would be required to work at least 20 hours a week to keep their benefits.
Additionally, changes to the state’s calculation of the hospital assessment fee or implementing the managed care assessment fee weren’t included in Wednesday’s presentation, though the latter could bring in $1.4 billion if fully implemented. 
But Mitch Roob, who helms the agency overseeing Medicaid, said he didn’t believe the Trump administration would allow the state to leverage the tax to the maximum extent.

Michelle Lujan Grisham struck language directing $80 million in new housing money to the state’s biggest city, Albuquerque officials believe the state will still provide adequate funds this upcoming fiscal year to help address the housing crisis. 
The governor late last week signed the record $10.8 billion budget lawmakers sent to her during the 60-day session, which included$110 million “to support housing, affordable housing, transitional housing and the expansion of housing services.” 
While the governor approved the total allocation — which the state Department of Finance and Administration will oversee — she crossed out language from lawmakers specifying $80 million for programs in Albuquerque and Bernalillo County, along with $10 million they had specified for Las Cruces and Doña Ana County. 
Striking the language did not impact the $110 million payment to the state Department of Finance and Administration, which will oversee the housing funds. However, legislative leaders had previously highlighted those earmarks as important because they directed most of the money to the areas where populations and needs are the biggest. 
Record number of housing bills introduced this session, but little to show for it, advocate says

“I think we’re investing far more in a targeted way that’s going to help bring folks off the streets and into homes,” said Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces) in a Feb. 24 news conference touting the House’s budget proposals. 
In a statement to Source New Mexico on Wednesday, the governor’s office defended striking the language, saying that now DFA will have more flexibility. 
“The removed language could have been interpreted as restrictive, effectively stating, ‘These are the only permitted uses for these funds,” governor’s spokesperson Jodi McGinnis-Porter said in an email. “By eliminating these constraints, DFA will have enhanced agility to respond to changing circumstances.”
Staci Dragmeister, a spokesperson for the City of Albuquerque, said the city is “optimistic” the change won’t affect the amount of money heading its way for housing. 
“The Governor kept the funding in place and there is a clear, critical need for more affordable housing and homeless services in Albuquerque,” she told Source in an email Wednesday. “The City is optimistic the funding will be used to help residents in Albuquerque and is ready to put it to work to build housing and expand services.”
A recent report from Pew Charitable Trusts found that homelessness in Albuquerque increased 108% between 2017 and 2024, which is more than the 87% increase seen across the state and nearly three times the 40% national average increase during that period. Despite adding more than 31,000 jobs in the last three years, city developers have added only 9,000 new housing units during that period. 
The line in the budget authorizing the $110 million in housing spending money to DFA specifies that the money is for affordable and transitional housing, and the expansion of housing services providers that “facilitate behavioral health services and substance abuse recovery, homelessness assistance and prevention for persons with behavioral health needs.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rentcontrol1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 18:09:41.757591

(Photo by Getty Images, logo courtesy the State of Iowa)A Sioux City hospital nurse, fired for numerous alleged instances of substandard care in the emergency room, is not entitled to unemployment benefits, a judge has ruled.
State records show that on Dec. 18, 2024, registered nurse Corriene McKeown was scheduled to work from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the emergency room at Sioux City’s MercyOne Siouxland Medical Center.
During her shift, the hospital later alleged, McKeown provided substandard nursing care to eight separate patients. For seven of the eight patients, McKeown allegedly failed to complete the required assessments. For one patient, McKeown allegedly failed to complete the required handoff in charting to ensure continuity of care once the patient was admitted to the hospital.
For another patient, who was admitted to the ER at 12:35 p.m. after complaining of increased confusion, McKeown allegedly failed to complete a level of consciousness assessment until 7 p.m.
For a third patient, who was admitted to the ER at 5:52 p.m., McKeown allegedly failed to complete time-sensitive triage medical charting until 7:10 p.m. and the absence of that charting contributed to a delay in patient care.
When hospital officials later met with McKeown to discuss the alleged deficiencies, McKeown asserted the ER had been busy and short-staffed, and that she could provide good patient care or good charting, but not both. According to the hospital, McKeown had previously been counseled about charting in April 2024 and June 2024.
On Jan. 28, 2025, McKeown was fired. After a hearing on her application for unemployment benefits, Administrative Law Judge James Timberland concluded recently the “weight of the evidence establishes multiple instances of carelessness” by McKeown on Dec. 18, 2024, and he ruled McKeown was ineligible for benefits.
“These were part of a pattern of carelessness,” Timberland stated in his ruling. That “careless performance,” he added, included “multiple instances of failing to properly and timely chart patient care, directly impacted patient care, directly impacted the employer’s ability to provide appropriate patient care, and indicated a willful disregard of the employer’s reasonable nursing care standards.”
Other unemployment cases
Other Iowa caregivers whose unemployment cases were recently decided include:
— Debra Rawlins, who worked as a certified nurse aide for On With Life from November 2023 until January 2025, when she was fired after being accused of repeatedly abandoning her duties and neglecting brain-injured residents in her care. The final incident leading to her dismissal occurred on Jan. 8, 2025, when she allegedly disappeared repeatedly from her assigned area and then failed to respond to calls made through a mobile communication system. She was accused of loitering in a single-occupant restroom for 45 to 60 minutes until being discovered there by a nurse on duty.
According to her employer, Rawlins had twice been counseled previously for neglecting her assigned residents for 30 to 60 minutes. On New Year’s Eve 2024, the company alleged, management suspected Rawlins was under the influence of alcohol while at work but elected not to invoke its alcohol-testing protocol. Administrative Law Judge James Timberland ruled recently that Rawlins was ineligible for unemployment benefits, concluding she had “neglected the brain-injured residents in her care so that she could loiter while on the clock.”
— Bernice Thompson, who worked as a receptionist for Universal Health Services Midwest, which operates Clive Behavioral Health. She was fired after allegedly failing to comply with policies tied to the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, which requires hospitals to stabilize patients before discharge.
The hospital policy barred patients from leaving prematurely without signing records acknowledging they were leaving against medical advice. Thompson had reportedly objected to that policy, arguing it violated patients’ human rights, unlawfully held them hostage and amounted to some form of Medicaid fraud. She was denied unemployment benefits, with a judge finding her conduct “disregarded the wellbeing of the patients and violated the employer’s EMTALA policy.”
— Damariss Magne, who worked as a certified nurse aide for Christian Retirement Homes from August 2024 through January 2025, when she was fired. The care facility alleged that on the evening of Jan. 12, 2025, Magne discovered that one resident of the home had fallen out of bed, with their face and arms on the floor, and their legs still on the bed. With the help of another CNA, she placed the resident back in bed but didn’t inform a nurse of the fall until an hour had passed. The company fired Magne, alleging that video showed during the hour after the fall Magne was in close proximity to nurses on multiple occasions and could have informed them of the incident. She was denied unemployment benefits.
— Jonnie Weeks-Almaguer, who worked as a certified nurse aide for the nursing home Corning Specialty Care from April 2024 until she was fired in February 2025 for allegedly verbally abusing a resident. On Feb. 19, 2025, another CNA at the home, Destiny Luft, had reported overhearing Weeks-Almaguer say to a resident something to the effect of, “You need to clean yourself up because you did it to yourself.” The resident allegedly corroborated Luft’s claim. Weeks-Almaguer was denied unemployment benefits.
— Kelley Bender, who worked for the Madrid Home for the Aging as the director of nursing from September 2023 until she was fired in January 2025. Several weeks before she was fired, Bender had talked to the home’s compliance officer about concerns she had with the leadership of the home’s administrator, Rick Colby, and the home’s failure to report an incident of some kind. Days later, she met with the home’s CEO to discuss the same concerns.
Shortly thereafter, the home’s management launched an investigation of Bender, who had no incurred no prior warnings or disciplinary actions while working at the home. Management interviewed Bender’s colleagues and subordinates and gathered complaints from multiple workers. Without speaking to Bender, management allegedly opted to fire her. Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Johnson recently ruled Bender is entitled to unemployment benefits, finding that the home’s stated reason for its investigation lacked credibility, and that “it seems more likely that her discharge was triggered by her report to the CEO than by her actual conduct at work.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IWD-UNEMPLOYMENT-ART.jpg,,,2025-04-16 18:09:41.757591

Free.,Maryland senator denied visitation with wrongly deported man in El Salvador,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maryland-senator-denied-visitation-wrongly-deported-man-el-salvador,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen Chris Van Hollen said Wednesday he was denied a meeting with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, an El Salvador-born Maryland resident who was mistakenly deported to a mega-prison in his home country notorious for human rights abuses.The Maryland Democrat met with El Salvador Vice President Félix Ulloa in the Central American country in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States. Abrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador, but a U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 finding that sending him back to his home country would put him in grave danger.After meeting with Ulloa, Van Hollen briefed reporters on the visit and said the Salvadoran vice president rebuffed his requests for contact with Abrego Garcia.“I asked the vice president if I could meet with Mr. Abrego Garcia and he said, ‘Well, you need to make earlier provisions to go visit CECOT (Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo),’” Van Hollen told reporters in El Salvador, referring to the mega-prison.“I said, ‘I’m not interested, at this moment, in taking a tour of CECOT, I just want to meet with Mr. Abrego Garcia,’” Van Hollen said.“He said he was not able to make that happen. He said he’d need a little more time. I asked him if I came back next week, whether I’d be able to see Mr. Abrego Garcia. He said he couldn’t promise that either,” the senator added. Van Hollen said he was also denied a phone or video call with Abrego Garcia to ask how he was doing and report that information to his family. The senator said he would contact the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and request they ask the government of El Salvador to connect the two of them via phone, following a suggestion from Ulloa.Van Hollen’s visit came a day after a federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to offer evidence on how it has sought to help with Abrego Garcia’s release from CECOT.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” — but did not require — his return to the United States. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele also said Monday that he would not bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.The Trump administration has acknowledged in court that Abrego Garcia was deported due to an “administrative error.”The administration accused him of being a member of the gang MS-13. He has not been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses, including gang-related crimes.Van Hollen, noting that the Trump administration “illegally abducted” Abrego Garcia, said he “won’t stop trying” to get the wrongly deported man out of the prison and back to Maryland and predicted others would follow.“I can assure the president, the vice president that I may be the first United States senator to visit El Salvador on this issue, but there will be more, and there will be more members of Congress coming,” he said.Administration respondsMeanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security posted on social media Wednesday a copy of a restraining order Abrego Garcia’s wife sought against him in 2021 “claiming he punched, scratched, and ripped off her shirt, among other harm.”In response, Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, told Newsweek she had a disagreement with him, but that things did not escalate and she did not continue with the civil court process. Late Wednesday afternoon, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt made a statement on the case, displaying the restraining order, repeating the accusation Abrego Garcia is a gang member and objecting to media references to him as a “Maryland father.”“There is no Maryland father,” she said.Patty Morin, the mother of a Maryland woman slain by a Salvadoran immigrant in the country without legal status, also appeared at the briefing and spoke in favor of the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation actions.",,,,2025-04-16 18:09:41.757591

Seth Magaziner, right, holds a routable discussion with business and labor leaders inside the  International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 11's Cranston offices on April 16, 2025. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) CRANSTON — President Donald Trump’s tariff policy is rattling more than international markets. It’s fueling economic uncertainty among Rhode Island’s business and labor leaders.
“It’s like throwing a cat into a bathtub full of water,” said Justin Kelley, a business representative and political director for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 11. “It’s going to react, naturally, very poorly most of the time.” 
Kelley made the comments at a roundtable of local leaders from Rhode Island’s building trades, hospitality, and medical equipment industries hosted by U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner at the union’s Cranston office Wednesday afternoon.
Hours after Trump’s reciprocal tariffs went into effect April 8, he placed a 90-day pause on nearly all of them. His universal 10% duty on imports from nearly every country remains in place, along with a 125% tariff on goods coming in from China. 
The 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, which went into effect on March 12, still remain in effect as well. Those duties will likely increase construction costs of projects employing Council 11’s roughly 600 Rhode Island-based workers.
Kelley told Rhode Island Current the union still has two years worth of public projects on the books. But if costs continue to spiral, he said projects will either reduce in scope or completely halt.
“If the steel doesn’t go up, we can’t paint the steel — and then we can’t put the drywall in and paint the building and do what we do,” he told Magaziner. “We have to figure out a way to try to mitigate this.”
Darryl Lindie, owner of AA Sign & Awning in Warwick, said he’s already had customers back out of signage projects after his team had completed the designs. On his way to the roundtable, he received a notification from a client who decided not to move forward with a project.
“I’m biased. I want to sell people the most signage that I can,” Lindie said. “You hate to see scopes of work decrease.”
​​Lauryn Estrella, executive director of the Home Medical Equipment and Services Association of New England, said many suppliers have been receiving notifications from manufacturers that they may have to raise the prices for wheelchairs and oxygen tanks.
“Our patients are the elderly and the disabled,” Estrella said. “They’re just being abandoned.”
Ryan Moot, manager of business development and government affairs for the Rhode Island Hospitality Association, told Magaziner that while restaurants aim to source locally whenever possible, it’s not feasible for commodities like coffee.
Most seafood sold in Rhode Island is caught in international waters, Moot said. Even catches hauled stateside, he said, are often processed outside the United States.
Moot recalled being with a seafood wholesaler in Washington D.C. when the tariffs were announced. He said the man frantically called everyone on the supply chain wondering just how much he would have to pay for shrimp coming in from Vietnam.
“There’s just so much that simply can’t be produced here,” Moot said.
Tariffs could lead to higher menu prices, which will turn away diners.
“There might be bigger brands that are more able to take that hit without passing it on to customers,” Moot said. But not the smaller local restaurants.
Who has the tariff authority?
Under the U.S. Constitution, the power to tax and tariff falls squarely on Congress, not the White House. 
But the legislative branch over the years has enacted laws giving the president some tariff powers, most notably through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The 1977 law gives the president the power to regulate international commerce in the event of a national emergency, which Trump has invoked in his latest attempt to tackle the nation’s trade deficit.
Congress could pass a law to regain its power over tariff policy with a veto-proof vote, but the  Republican-led House of Representatives on April 9 approved a procedural rule prohibiting the chamber from considering legislation to rescind the tariffs until at least Sept. 30.
Rhode Island’s Royal Charter inspires lawmaker’s idea for coping with tariff troubles

“If Republicans in Congress would actually grow a spine and have the courage to stand up to president Trump, in theory we could end these tariffs tomorrow,” Magaziner told Rhode Island Current. “But so far, the Republican leadership isn’t willing to do that.”
GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa has proposed a bill requiring the president to notify Congress of impending tariffs within 48 hours, which Trump has threatened to veto. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, has filed companion legislation in the House. Magaziner commended his GOP colleagues, but said there still needs to be popular support across the aisle.
In the meantime, Magaziner told industry leaders to continue to use their personal stories to raise the alarm.
“The administration has shown they are susceptible to public pressure, particularly on this,” he said. “The American people clearly do not want this.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)A federal judge has temporarily blocked the cancellation of a 21-year-old University of Wisconsin-Madison undergraduate student’s visa and any actions in relation to that by the Trump administration. 
Krish Lal Isserdasani, who is from India, has been studying computer engineering at the UW-Madison since 2021 with plans to graduate on May 10. On April 4, just a month before graduation, Isserdasani received notification from UW-Madison’s International Student Services office that his visa was cancelled and his authorization to be in the country would end on May 2. He received no communication from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or the State Department regarding the visa revocation.  
His cancellation was part of a wave of cancellations at universities across the country as President Donald Trump’s administration targets international students and ramps up deportation efforts in a crackdown on immigration.
U.S. District Judge William Conley wrote in his order Tuesday that Isserdasani has a “reasonable likelihood of success” on his claim that his visa was wrongly terminated and faces “possible devastating irreparable harm” as a result of the cancellation. Conley’s order bans the government from revoking his visa, detaining him or taking any other actions related to the cancellation pending a preliminary hearing April 28.
“The loss of timely academic process alone is sufficient to establish irreparable harm,” Conley wrote. “Given the amount of Isserdasani’s educational expenses and potential losses from having to leave the United States without obtaining his degree, the court concludes that Isserdasani credibly demonstrates that he faces irreparable harm for which he has no adequate remedy at law in the absence of injunctive relief.” 
Since the termination earlier this month, Isserdasani has reported a significant psychological impact on him, according to the order, including “difficulty in sleeping and fear that he will be placed in immediate detention and deportation.” 
“He reports being afraid to leave his apartment for fear of being apprehended at any moment,” the order states.
According to the complaint, Isserdasani and his family have spent about $240,000 on his education in the country. He would lose $17,500 on the current semester’s tuition and would be responsible for four months of rent despite not being able to stay in the country, the complaint states.  
Isserdasani is represented by Madison lawyer Shabnam Lotfi, who said in a statement to the Wisconsin State Journal that the “international students have done absolutely nothing wrong.” 
“They have followed U.S. laws and fully complied with the terms of their student status. They do not deserve this,” Lotfi said. “America must speak out against this injustice and not allow the Administration to distort the facts for their own political purposes.”
Isserdasani is one of dozens of students and alumni at University of Wisconsin institutions to have had their visas canceled by the federal government in recent weeks. There have been at least 26 at UW-Madison, 13 at UW-Milwaukee and several more at other campuses.
UW-Madison first announced cancellations on April 8, saying the university wasn’t notified by the government but had learned about them because staff has been reviewing federal databases every day to see whether students have been affected
According to the Associated Press, the Trump administration’s work to cancel visas has affected  at least 901 students at more than 128 colleges and universities nationwide. Some have been participants in protests about the war in Gaza, and others have had minor infractions, including traffic violations, according to published reports. 
Conley’s order indicates that Isserdasani appears to have had his visa canceled in relation to an arrest for disorderly conduct in November 2024 after he and friends got into an argument with other people while walking home from a bar one night. Madison District Attorney Ismael Ozanne declined to pursue charges after the arrest, and Isserdasani never had to appear in court and thought the issue was dealt with. He has had no other encounters with police, the order says. 
The university’s notification email that Isserdasani received stated that the reason given was “otherwise failing to maintain status” and he was “identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.” It said the termination “does not have a grace period to depart the U.S.” and that “employment benefits, including on-campus employment and any practical training you may have had authorized, end immediately when a SEVIS record is terminated. Therefore, you no longer have authorization to work in the United States.”
The order said Isserdasani “was given no warning, no opportunity to explain or defend himself and no chance to correct any potential misunderstanding.”
The judge’s order also covers the visa cancellation for Hamidreza Khademi, a 34-year-old citizen of Iran and graduate student at Iowa State University, who is also being represented by Lotfi.  Khademi graduated in December 2023, but was working in the country through a visa extension approved in 2024.
Khademi was arrested in February of 2024 and accused of evading arrest in a vehicle in Texas. However, the Texas Department of Public Safety eventually determined that there was no violation and decided against filing charges. His visa was terminated on April 10 and an email notifying him included similar reasoning as the one Isserdasani received. 
The judge reserved a ruling on the motion for a temporary restraining order for Khademi, pending further briefing by the parties, because he questioned whether the western Wisconsin court was the appropriate venue for the case. 
“Plaintiffs include no facts showing that venue is proper for the claims brought by Khademi, who appears to have no ties to the Western District of Wisconsin, nor do the events or omissions giving rise to his claims,” the judge wrote.

Josh Shapiro and other elected officials celebrate the opening of Hershey’s first fully-integrated digital manufacturing plant on April 16, 2025. (Commonwealth Media Services)The Hershey Company has marked the opening of their first new plant in its namesake community in more than three decades.
One of the world’s largest candymakers, the company is based in Hershey, Dauphin County. 
Several Pennsylvania elected officials were on hand Wednesday for the facility’s ribbon-cutting. Gov. Josh Shapiro lauded the Hershey Company as one of Pennsylvania’s great manufacturers.
“I think it is particularly good and meaningful for me to be here today, given the events of this past weekend, to celebrate the growth of this iconic company,” Shapiro said. “I know it’s easy to look at the world and see the people who are trying to tear things down. Today we’re here to celebrate a great company that is building things up and creating dreams and opportunity for so many people.”
Michele Buck, President and CEO of the Hershey Company, said the processing plant is the first new manufacturing facility constructed in Derry Township, outside Hershey, in more than 30 years. She also said it is the company’s  first fully digital integrated manufacturing facility with “high levels of automation, exemplifying the next step in our digital manufacturing roadmap.”
Shapiro said the new facility is going to create 125 new jobs in the state and thanked the company for having a “huge reach” from the farmlands to the corporate centers and beyond in Pennsylvania.

“It’s true that Hershey could have chosen to be anywhere for this new facility, but instead, they chose to invest a billion dollars to expand their footprint right here at home in Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said. “That is a big deal. It is a point of pride for us, and we are grateful that you have doubled down on your commitment to Pennsylvania.”
“We’re very, very grateful for the jobs, for the commitment to this community and to this effort and to Milton Hershey’s legacy, which was not only about chocolate, but was about community, about philanthropy, about doing good for our community,” U.S. Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District), who represents Hershey.
State Sen. Patty Kim (D-15th District) and state Rep. Tom Mehaffie (R-106th District) represent Hershey in Pennsylvania’s General Assembly and were also on hand for the new facility’s opening.

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)End-to-end encryption has made crimes against minors significantly harder to prosecute, legal experts say. Florida lawmakers plan to make social media companies cooperate with those investigations. 
The Sen. Blaise Ingoglia-introduced SB 868 is headed to the Senate floor after passing the Rules Committee Wednesday. Social media companies offering encrypted messaging are in opposition to the bill while state attorneys came to Tallahassee hoping the Legislature would make their jobs easier. 
Encrypted messages, those designed only to be read by the sender and receiver, not the owners of the platform it was sent on, are designed to prevent hackers or others acting in bad faith from accessing personal messages. 
Since end-to-end encryption has become widely-used, Ingoglia said, social media companies have told prosecutors they have no records to provide toward convicting “nefarious” actors in child pornography and drug trafficking cases.
“As you know, there are extremely bad actors online targeting minors with sexually explicit and sexually suggestive materials,” Ingoglia said. “Encryption, used by social media companies, makes it more challenging if not impossible for law enforcement to retrieve the proof necessary to put these guys behind bars.”
The bill would require social media companies to de-crypt messages if subpoenaed by a court and prohibit minors from using messages that are designed to disappear.
Popular apps like Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger offer end-to-end encryption.
NetChoice, a tech association representing some of the largest social platforms, contest the bill, saying it is “well intentioned” but “fundamentally undermines the core purpose of encryption.”
“Creating an encryption backdoor is fraught with privacy and security risks,” NetChoice stated on its website.  
Rep. Michelle Salzman is sponsor of the House version, HB 743, which must pass the Commerce Committee before receiving a floor vote. 
“I shared with all the social media companies that came to see me that we are going to put the safety of Floridians first and them second, and either they can get on board and look good or they can just stand there and fight and lose,” Salzman told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “We’re not going to stop here. This bill will pass this year and we’re going to continue the momentum.”
This bill is another in lawmakers’ effort to protect minors online.
Minors younger than 14-years-old will be prohibited from using social media if the state successfully defends its 2024 law that also requires parental consent for 14-and-15-year-olds to use social media platforms with addictive features. NetChoice filed suit against the state on that 2024 law, HB 3.
“So, just think if you were a parent, and you know that your child is being groomed by somebody online, and the child is now being pressured to give nude photos or create child pornography for the purpose of transmitting over,” Ingoglia said. 
“And you went to a state’s attorney or a prosecutor and they tried and they gave the subpoena or the warrant and the social media came back and they said, ‘Hey we have nothing.’”
Ingoglia said he does not think social media companies are behaving in good faith.
“Under any other section of law when it comes to prosecuting, somebody who destroys evidence will be put away,” Ingoglia said. “But social media companies though their algorithms and through their coding are allowed to destroy evidence all the time.” 
State Attorney Amira Fox, prosecuting in Charlotte, Collier, Glades, Hendry, and Lee counties, stood beside Salzman and Ingoglia Wednesday in hopes the bill will pass.  
“Social media platforms have made it very difficult for prosecutors,” Fox said, adding that end-to-end encryption has attracted people who want to use it for illegal purposes. 
Fox said compared to the beginning of her career, social media have boosted the number of cases involving child predators.
“We have spent years putting together task forces to tackle human trafficking and child abuse, and now we’re met with, when we send our subpoenas and our search warrants to these social media companies … we get back ‘no material exists,’ because they’ve encrypted it,” Fox said during a news conference Wednseday afternoon at the Capitol.
Fox said the lawmakers’ bill is a “great bill to stand up to this.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House voted 55-37 on Wednesday in favor of a bill that some worry will lead to state employees paying health insurance premiums — though supporters say that is not the intention of the proposal.
Senate Bill 2160 would move the state’s insurance to a plan that offers benefits compliant with the federal Affordable Care Act.
Proponents say it will give the state more flexibility over plan designs, which are limited under the current plan.
This could save the state money at no extra cost to employees, said Rep. Jonathan Warrey, R-Casselton, the bill’s sponsor. Savings are especially important in light of rising health care costs, he added.
North Dakota lawmakers consider bill that could lead to state employees paying for health premiums

The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday forwarded the bill with a 15-7 do-pass recommendation. 
The bill is expected to cost $6.6 million for the 2025-2027 budget cycle, plus an additional more than $25 million for the 2027-2029 biennium, according to a fiscal analysis attached to the bill.
One of the biggest concerns voiced by critics is that the state would be able to start charging employees premiums. The state may be tempted to do so to offset the additional cost of the plan, opponents said. Under the current plan, the state cannot charge premiums.
Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, said the bill does not force premiums on employees and there’s no reason the state would need to in the future. The state would not have to charge employees premiums in order for the plan to be Affordable Care Act-compliant.
“I have no intention of charging a premium to the state employees,” Koppelman said.
During committee discussion, however, some lawmakers did indicate they’d like to see state employees contribute to health insurance.
Rep. Eric Murphy, R-Grand Forks, said that changing the plan is taking a big risk without assurance employees will prefer it. He said it’s not clear that the plan will save money.
People often take jobs with the state government for the benefits and stability, he argued.
  Rep. Jonathan Warrey, R-Casselton. (Photo provided by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly)
Warrey said Senate Bill 2160 would also give employees more free benefits, such as preventive health care like colonoscopy screening and mammograms. It would allow co-pays to count toward out-of-pocket maximums.
Rep. Jim Kasper, R-Fargo, said that if employees take advantage of preventive care services the cost of the state plan will go down over time. They’ll be able to address health conditions before they become more severe and more costly, he reasoned.
According to Kasper, who said he has worked in employee benefits for 25 years, the private sector moved to Affordable Care-Act compliant plans long ago because they offer more flexibility. 
“Grandfathered plans in my opinion are like dinosaurs,” Kasper said.
If the state saves money by changing the plan, it could reallocate those extra funds into raising wages for employees, said Koppelman. This could be positive for recruitment and retention, he said.
“Young individuals are looking for more dollars in the check,” Koppelman said.
Some state agencies have come out in opposition to the plan, Rep. Austen Schauer, R-West Fargo, noted on the floor. 
The Office of Management and Budget, for example, has said that employees consider the current health plan an important benefit and worry about the new plan impacting North Dakota’s ability to attract state workers. The agency has also expressed concerns about how the state will fund the plan.
Schauer said the state should seek more thorough data about the proposal, including what an Affordable Care Act-compliant plan would cost and how many employees support the change.
The bill represents a “huge decision that needs to be studied with input from all stakeholders,” Schauer said.
The bill is expected to go to the Senate next for a concurrence vote.

,DC,2025-04-16 21:26:12+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,RFK Jr. to refocus federal autism research on environmental factors,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rfk-jr-refocus-federal-autism-research-environmental-factors,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday the department will shift its research into autism toward potential environmental causes, though he declined to say exactly what the Trump administration would do if certain industries or pollutants were found responsible.Kennedy, an environmental lawyer with no medical or research training, declared that autism is a preventable disease, argued research into genetic causes is a “dead end” and asserted that “we know it’s environmental exposure,” before saying HHS would fund “a series of new studies to identify precisely what the environmental toxins are that are causing it.”“This has not been done before,” Kennedy said. “We’re going to do it in a thorough and comprehensive way and we’re going to get back with an answer to the American people very, very quickly.”Kennedy said during his first press conference since receiving Senate confirmation that he wanted researchers to look into numerous potential factors, including mold, food additives, pesticides, air, water, medicines, ultrasound, age of parents, obesity in parents and diabetes in parents.He pledged to have “some of the answers by September,” though he added the research will “be an evolving process.”Kennedy appeared confident in his personal assessment that environmental factors lead to autism, without attributing that belief to any one industry or contaminant.“This is coming from an environmental toxin and somebody made a profit by putting that environmental toxin into our air, our water, our medicines, our food,” Kennedy said. “And it’s to their benefit to normalize it, to say, ‘This is all normal. It has always been here.’ But that’s not good for our country.”Autism experts, however, cast doubt on Kennedy’s assertion that environmental factors lead to autism and questioned his proposed timeline to prove such a link.When asked by a reporter what exactly the Trump administration would do if research found conclusive evidence that one specific industry or pollutant was causing autism, Kennedy didn’t say whether HHS would push to ban it or close down any businesses. “I think we’re going to figure out a way to make pressure on them to remove it,” he said. “I think also there will be market forces that also exert pressure on them to remove it.”Research difficultCatherine Lord, professor of psychiatry with the school of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, said during an interview with States Newsroom following Kennedy’s remarks that trying to reach a definitive cause of autism before September was an ""utterly ridiculous” timeline.Lord said “the most likely hypothesis is that there may be interactions between genetics and, for example, environmental exposures, or even experiences like extreme prematurity.”But she noted that studying the impact of environmental contaminants on people’s health, or a complex diagnosis like autism, is challenging because scientists obviously cannot expose people to toxins.“It's so difficult to do that work well, and people do it, but they can't do it quickly,” Lord said. “And so I think that we do need work in that area, and I think it has been funded in the last few years. It just hasn't come out with anything that is earth-shattering. It's more the same thing, which is that if you're exposed to something bad, your chances of having a child with any kind of neurodevelopmental disorder is going to go up.”Lord expressed concern about moving funding and research away from genetic factors, saying “we do know that autism is genetic, so I think that is not under question.”“I think the genetic work was moving forward,” she said. “It's a slow pace, again, because they're addressing so many different genetic patterns. But I think that at least there's clear progress within this science.”Limits funding for genetic researchEric Fombonne, professor emeritus of psychiatry at Oregon Health and Sciences University, said during an interview that it was unwise for Kennedy to say there would be some answers about autism within a few months.“It's ridiculous to say that he's going to unravel the etiology of autism in six months,” Fombonne said. “I mean, he could give, like, all the money of the world to any lab or any person. They could never report any results before several years from now, at the minimum.”The pace of medical research, he said, is slow and Kennedy’s comments show “a complete ignorance and disregard for science and what we do and how complicated it is and the time it takes.”Directing research dollars toward possible environmental contributors to autism will also limit the amount of funding available for genetic research, which Fombonne said “has been incredibly productive.”“The pie is limited,” Fombonne said. “So if you move funds from genetic research to environmental research, you're going to slow down the pace of genetic research.”Fombonne explained that research into genetics and autism is “quite complicated” and has shown that not all genetic mechanisms are “the same across different families.”“So it's a very complex puzzle. And as you know, the brain is a very hard organ to study. So understanding the pathophysiology, which is associated with these gene variants, is a very hard process,” he said. “But we are doing that and we are progressing.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Majority Leader Scott Odenbach waved his hand behind him, gesturing to the lawmakers’ lobby just a few paces beyond his desk on the House floor.
“I would ask anyone in this room to walk right out the doors here and see the plaster crumbling and running down the walls,” the Spearfish Republican said in late February.
He was speaking in support of a bill to restore, maintain and repair South Dakota’s Capitol building. Lawmakers approved $3 million, growing the pool of funds set aside during the past six years for Capitol building and grounds projects to nearly $12 million. About $9 million remains unspent.
Signs of disrepair from age and neglect are scattered throughout the 115-year-old building, from that chipping plaster to cracked paint and water damage. There are also concerns about Capitol Lake, fed by a well once thought to be a sinkhole risk and adorned with a Flaming Fountain that no longer flames.

As the list of projects grows, the state official in charge of maintaining the complex is considering a full renovation of the building and trying to solve the puzzle of the lake’s future.
Board approves $1.2 million restoration and renovation study
The citizen board that oversees Capitol restoration projects approved a plan Wednesday to divide $3 million among three projects:

Up to $500,000 on plaster repair and paint in public spaces.
$1.3 million to restore the Capitol dome.
$1.2 million to map out a plan for a full restoration and renovation of the rest of the Capitol building.

The plaster and paint needs are immediate, but Commissioner of the Bureau of Human Resources and Administration Darin Seeley said walls torn down to address potential infrastructure repairs might make painting more than necessary now a waste of taxpayer dollars.
A 2023 study by the bureau found plumbing, heating and cooling, and electrical code violations throughout the building due to its age — some piping is original to the building’s 1910 construction. The estimated cost to fix those issues at the time was $75 million.
“As appreciative as I am of the $3 million appropriation, it’s really important we don’t spend $3 million just to spend $3 million and then tear it back apart,” Seeley told members of the Capitol Complex Restoration and Beautification Commission.
The bureau wants to restore the Capitol dome to give South Dakotans an “introduction” to what a full restoration would look like, Seeley said. That could help with fundraising efforts if the state decides to pursue a full restoration and renovation.

The structural changes and further renovations Seeley envisions will likely require private sector dollars, Fort Pierre Republican Rep. Will Mortenson told South Dakota Searchlight, which is “an entirely different conversation.”
The $3 million Mortenson pushed for this year is intended to fix the “glaring needs” inside the Capitol.
The dome work will include repairing damaged plaster, repainting the walls, replacing lights on an arch near the grand staircase and installing lights on the dome ledges to highlight the decoration and detail inside.
The legislative budget committee sent a letter of intent to Seeley in March, requesting an annual report until the newly appropriated $3 million is spent. The report will detail each project, its rationale, cost and timeline.
Plaster repair will begin this year, while dome restoration work on site will begin next April after the end of legislative session.
Capitol Lake improvements no longer an ‘emergency’
Doubt surfaced among some lawmakers this session about the need for more money when taxpayers have yet to see many results from past funding.
About three-fourths of the $12 million in funding is devoted to the grounds, and for Capitol Lake, which is fed by an uncapped, free-flowing well more than 1,300 feet deep. The well was drilled in 1910 by Peter Norbeck, who led the Norbeck Drilling Company before serving as South Dakota governor and a U.S. senator. The well produces not only water around 95 degrees Fahrenheit for the lake but also natural gas, which was diverted to light and heat the Capitol for decades before it caused an explosion in 1958.
The gas flowed reliably enough for years afterward to light a flame atop the flowing water that came to be known as the Flaming Fountain. But by 2008, the gas sputtered. A 2019 report by a team from South Dakota Mines said the underground pocket of natural gas was probably almost depleted, and that the well’s steel casing could be corroded and in danger of a sinkhole-inducing collapse that would make it difficult to stem the flow of water.
After that, state officials began planning to replace the lake’s water source.

Seeley told South Dakota Searchlight the state has until July 2027 to spend about $3.9 million in legislatively appropriated funds on lake improvements, due to a spending deadline in state law. A $2 million lake grant from the state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources remains unspent as well. The grant is intended to help establish an alternative water source for the lake, and to conserve water by pumping it from the lake to water the Capitol complex green space. The plan would conserve more than 8 million gallons to water 40 acres.
About $3 million has been spent on the lake so far. The money was used to study the well, plan an alternative water source and dredge the lake. The dredging cost about $2.6 million, according to a contract with Morris Construction Enterprise.
The bureau is waiting to spend the remaining lake funds because it discovered that the situation with the well isn’t as urgent as feared, Seeley said. Engineering and design firm Snyder and Associates tested the water quality and inspected the bottom of the well via camera last year.
“We don’t have an emergency,” Seeley said. “I don’t want to waste money, so we’re stepping back to consider the bigger picture.”
The well as it currently stands is not a viable long-term water source for the lake, Seeley said. The report said that although the well is in “relatively good condition,” it is constructed of “unverified and obsolete materials,” isn’t in compliance with modern design standards and “likely surpassed its expected design life.”

Replacement options include restoring the existing well and controlling the water flow, drilling a new well on the site and using a reverse osmosis system to improve the lake’s water quality, or piping water from the nearby Missouri River.
Because the warm well water keeps the lake from freezing over, thousands of Canada geese — the unofficial Capitol mascot — inhabit and leave droppings in and around the lake year-round, leading to poor water quality. Stormwater runoff compounds the problem, according to Snyder and Associates, which helped dredge the lake in 2023. Some new water sources, such as transporting Missouri River water, would allow the lake to freeze over in the winter, removing the geese and droppings for part of the year.
The return of a Flaming Fountain is questionable. The options to replace the lake’s water source don’t involve finding a new source of natural gas in the old location. While a new Flaming Fountain of some form is proposed for the Capitol Lake conceptual design, “the flame as it was known cannot return,” a bureau spokesman said in an email.
Lakota Code Talker Memorial has a ‘whole bunch’ of fundraising left
Mortenson carried bills to improve the Capitol Lake and the Capitol building during the 2023 and 2025 legislative sessions. He expected the 2023 funding would not only go toward replacing the lake’s water source but toward sitework for a Sioux Code Talker Memorial to honor “some of South Dakota’s most worthy heroes.”

The Sioux Code Talker Memorial is a planned site at Capitol Lake to honor Lakota, Dakota and Nakota code talkers who served in World Wars I and II. More than two hundred tribal members from South Dakota served in the military, using their native language to communicate during battle without enemy forces cracking the code.
The memorial will include a wall of names for Oceti Sakowin code talkers and two bronze sculptures created by Sioux Falls-based sculptor Darwin Wolf. The memorial’s donation drive is open on the South Dakota Community Foundation website. Robert Dunsmore, tribal service officer for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and a member of the code talker fundraising committee, said the group has “a whole bunch” of fundraising left.
The Bureau of Human Resources and Administration will “have a role to play” in ensuring “access to the approved site” when the fundraising is ready, a department spokesman said in a statement.
 



Money for Capitol projects
2019: The Legislature allowed the Bureau of Administration to spend $200,000 in private funding to study the Flaming Fountain (which no longer burns) at Capitol Lake.
2022: The Legislature appropriated $500,000 in general funds and $3 million in federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act to the Bureau of Administration to develop a master plan for Capitol Lake, to plug the existing well and improve the lake water quality.
2023: The Legislature appropriated $3.2 million in general funds and $2 million in “other fund” expenditure authority to the Bureau of Administration to secure the existing well, replace the Capitol Lake water source, preserve existing memorials and accommodate “additional memorials and improvements.” The “other fund” authority was to secure a $2 million state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources grant for Capitol Lake improvements.

(File/Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Up to 15,000 K-12 students could receive $7,500 scholarships next year for private school tuition under a compromise between the House and Senate that seeks to reinstate and expand payments halted by the state Supreme Court.
After pushback from Democrats over not having enough time to read and fully consider the changes, senators decided to postpone a vote on returning the amended bill to the House.
But that’s just a timing issue. Democrats don’t have the votes to stop advancement.
For the coming school year, eligibility would continue to be capped at 10,000 students whose parents earn up to 300% of federal poverty guidelines. For a family of four, for example, the income limit would be $96,450.
Eligibility would then max out in 2026-27 at 15,000 students living in households with incomes up to 500% of the poverty line. Under 2025 guidelines, the income limit would be nearly $161,000 for a family of four.
The compromise, adopted 29-13 mostly along party lines, was a deal cut between Senate and House education chairs, said Senate Education Chairman Greg Hembree.
No Democrat voted for it. Two Republicans voted against it: Sen. Shane Martin of Spartanburg County and Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey of Edgefield, who said the proposed expansion could result in higher-income parents taking most of the slots.
The Edgefield Republican, whose children attend public schools, has consistently said the idea was to help children stuck in failing schools whose parents couldn’t afford any other option — not as a state bonus for well-off parents already paying for private tuition.
Republican leadership named the issue a top priority this year after the state Supreme Court struck down the private tuition payments last September as unconstitutional. Nearly 800 students have since been relying on private donors to pay their tuition this school year.
SC Senate passes K-12 voucher bill pulling from lottery profits

Typically, when the House and Senate pass differing versions of a proposal, the chambers will send the legislation to a six-member panel — consisting of three legislators from each chamber — to hammer out the differences. But reaching a compromise through that process would have been difficult and might have held up the bill, said Hembree, R-Little River.
So, he met with House Education Chairwoman Shannon Erickson, R-Beaufort, and officials with the state Department of Education to figure out a middle ground, Hembree said.
“The bones of the bill remain pretty much the same,” he said.
SC House passes bill to revive K-12 vouchers. The bulk of this year’s money will go unused.

The deal would give students who are in public school and below 300% of federal poverty guidelines priority through early application windows, Hembree said.
The Legislature would also have the option of increasing the number of slots by allocating more money in the budget, he said.
Each student would receive a set $7,500 scholarship for the school year, rather than an amount that would adjust depending on state aid to public schools.
That money could come from either the lottery fund or the state’s general fund. The thinking is that the state’s high court will find one of the two options constitutional in the expected next legal challenge, Hembree said.
The money would go to students through a third-party “trustee,” a position the House added in an effort to circumvent the state constitution’s ban on public dollars directly benefiting private education.
“In my view, this is an insurance policy,” Hembree said.
The idea of a trustee raised immediate alarms for Sen. Russell Ott, D-St. Matthews.
“What guarantee do we have to the taxpayers of this state that when we let go of that money, we have any control of it whatsoever?” Ott said.
That was just what he noticed on a cursory glance. The proposal could contain more concerns upon closer examination, he said.
“That’s what should be concerning to everyone, that I have been able to find those questions in a matter of 30 minutes,” Ott said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/hembree-1024x873.jpg,,,2025-04-16 18:09:41.757591

The state Senate passed a bill Tuesday attempting to stop habitual speeders in their tracks.
Passed on a 40-8 vote, House Bill 1596 would require certain drivers to install an “intelligent speed assistance” device that limits their car to the posted speed limit of the area they are in. Drivers with the device would be allowed to exceed the speed limit up to three times a month.
Similar to how ignition interlock devices are mandated for people with a history of drunk driving, a person would have a speed limiter if they get a restricted license that requires one, during a probation period after getting their license suspended for reckless driving or excessive speeding, or if they have been ordered to have a device by a court.
“Installing intelligent speed assistance devices in vehicles will guarantee that drivers physically cannot exceed the speed limit,” said Sen. John Lovick, D-Mill Creek, during the floor debate.
“It is also a reminder to the drivers of their dangerous driving behavior, and hopefully will serve as a tool for lasting behavior change,” he added.
“We’re losing family members, we’re losing lost souls to those who are intentionally choosing to drive fast. And this will provide an opportunity to save our neighbors and increase our public safety,” said prime sponsor Rep. Mari Leavitt, D-University Place, after the bill passed.
Leavitt pointed to state data showing fatal car crashes have been on an upward trend since 2019, with a growing number of them involving speeding.
She was particularly moved by a crash in King County last March that killed 38-year-old Andrea Smith and three children. A man was accused of causing the crash by driving well over 100 miles an hour in a 40 mph zone. He pleaded guilty earlier this month.









The bill was titled “The BEAM Act” in honor of those who died in the crash.
“BEAM is an acronym for the first letter of the first name of the four who died last March in Renton, so Boyd, Eloise, Andrea and Matilda,” Leavitt explained.
Eight Republicans ultimately voted against the legislation. Sen. Perry Dozier, R-Waitsburg, said while he supports the intent of stopping habitual speeders, he had concerns about oversight and monitoring “creeping into others” with one or two isolated incidents.
“There could be an instance where you have to speed, a medical emergency where something is happening – maybe your wife’s having a baby and you’re exceeding the speed limit and then you get caught like that,” he said.
The bill will go back to the House to concur with amendments made in the Senate before heading over to the governor.
“I’ve heard from the governor’s office that they’re very excited about this bill and about the ability to save lives,” Leavitt said. “So I’m feeling very confident that we’ll get it over the finish line this year.”

SPRINGFIELD — The Illinois House gave its approval to legislation that would give high school athletes a limited right to compete in non-school events or on non-school teams during the same season in which they play for their school.

The House voted 68-39 on April 9 to pass a scaled-back version of a bill known as the Right to Play Act. It would partially override an existing rule of the Illinois High School Association that says students who participate on a school team may not also participate on a non-school team or compete in outside tournaments or events in the same sport during the same season, unless they obtain permission from both their school and IHSA.

The association currently allows students to obtain as many as three waivers in a season to compete in outside contests or tournaments if those events are sanctioned by the sport’s national governing body.

Rep. Janet Yang-Rohr, D-Naperville, said she thinks that rule is too restrictive because it doesn’t allow for events sponsored by international sports organizations.

“Our athletes right now in Illinois have to decline invitations from FIFA (the international soccer governing body), from the Olympic development program, from offers to play with national teams in Canada and Scotland, because these IHSA rules compel the organization to deny their waiver requests,” she said on the House floor. “This legislation will finally be able to let those student athletes participate in those events too.”

Under the amended bill, student athletes would be able to obtain waivers for as many as two outside events per year, including “all-star team” events. But they would only need the agreement of their school’s principal or athletics director, not IHSA. The bill also would not require the events to be sanctioned by any official governing body.

That is significantly more restrictive than the original bill, which would have removed the prohibition on simultaneous participation almost entirely. It would have prohibited participating in both a school competition or practice and a non-school activity on the same day.

That proposal passed out of the House Education Policy Committee in March, despite warnings from some critics that allowing unrestricted dual participation could endanger the health and safety of the athletes while also setting up the possibility of conflict between a school coach and non-school coach.

But Rep. Martin McLaughlin, R-Barrington Hills, who voted for the amended bill, said during floor debate that he would have preferred going even further in limiting the authority of IHSA.

“This is an unfortunate turn with your amendments, but I completely appreciate … what you had to do to get this started,” he said during floor debate. “But frankly, let's next year – and I'll join you – get this completely wiped out. Get the IHSA back in the lane where they should be, which is to be fair and to allow all these students to have every equal opportunity for scholarships that they can get.”

IHSA Executive Director Craig Anderson said in an email Wednesday that the association still opposes the proposed legislation because it puts principals and athletic directors in charge of deciding whether a student should be granted a waiver.

“It’s my understanding that the schools prefer a process whereby review of such participation is considered by the Association to create equity in opportunities across the membership,” Anderson said.

The bill now awaits further action in the Senate.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) A coalition of labor unions submitted 320,000 signatures in support of a referendum to overturn a controversial union bill on Wednesday. If their numbers are right, it’s the most signatures ever gathered for a referendum in Utah. 
It’s the latest in a monthslong saga related to HB267, a controversial law passed this legislative session that prohibits public unions from collective bargaining. 
Now, a group of 20 unions called the Protect Utah Workers coalition is one step closer to handing the issue over to voters through a ballot referendum, where citizens can vote on new laws, or repeal existing ones, during elections. 
Forcing a referendum in Utah is no walk in the park. Per state code, a group has 30 days to gather signatures from 8% of Utah voters, including 8% of the voters in at least 15 of the state’s 29 Senate districts. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That 8% figure roughly equates to 141,000 signatures. The announcement of 320,000 signatures Wednesday shatters that threshold, making the effort to overturn HB267 one of the most successful in state history. 
“We are on track to become not only the most successful citizen-led referendum in Utah history, but one of the most successful in our nation’s history,” said John Arthur, a sixth grade teacher at Meadowlark Elementary School in Salt Lake City. “We didn’t just meet our goal, we doubled it.” 
Arthur spoke on Wednesday during a media event outside the Salt Lake County Government building, after the coalition turned over boxes containing thousands of signature packets to County Clerk Lannie Chapman’s office. 
“It’s certainly the biggest referendum effort I’ve ever seen,” Chapman said after the media event. For reference, a successful tax reform referendum in 2020 gathered about 155,000 signatures. 
Chapman’s team now has 21 days to verify the packets and confirm the signatures come from registered voters who live in Salt Lake County — the same goes for county clerks around the state. Once verified, the voter’s name will be made publicly available, opening a 45-day window where the voter can choose to rescind their support for the referendum, if they choose.

When the county clerks are done, the lieutenant governor’s office will then review the process. Assuming the coalition has complied with state code and gathered enough valid signatures, ballot language will be crafted for the 2026 General Election.
It’s likely some of the signatures will be deemed invalid — some people may have signed twice, aren’t registered to vote, gave an incorrect address, or have illegible handwriting. 
Plus, groups like the Utah chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative policy and advocacy organization, have launched their own campaign in support of HB267. Called “Decline to Sign,” the group will continue to advocate against the referendum during the 45-day window where voters can retract their signatures. 
But with a cushion of almost 180,000 signatures, the coalition is feeling confident the fate of HB267 will be left to voters. 
“Politicians came after public workers and the public got to work,” said Arthur. “Now the people of Utah will get to decide what kind of state we’re going to be.” 



Let us know what you think...


 


Signed by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox in February, HB267 prevents public unions from collective bargaining, the process where unions meet with employers to negotiate a contract or terms of employment. The bill takes effect July 1, 2025. 
Come July, a teachers union will no longer be allowed to negotiate an employment contract with a school district. The same goes for firefighters, police officers, municipal workers and other public employees. 
Lawmakers say the bill will protect taxpayer dollars while giving all public employees a voice, not just union members. If a teachers union only represents one third of the employees in a school district, it shouldn’t be able to negotiate employment contracts on behalf of everyone, said the bill sponsors, Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, and Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy. 
Currently, just Salt Lake City’s police and fire departments, and a handful of the state’s school districts, have unions that engage in collective bargaining. 
“More than 99% of all the (public) unions that currently exist today do not do collective bargaining,” said Cullimore earlier this year. “All the services that they provide their members, the services they provide employees, all the education and training that they do, will still be available.”
But labor groups and members of the public were staunchly opposed to the bill, which narrowly passed out of the Legislature. That opposition morphed into the Protect Utah Workers coalition — among them are the Utah State Fraternal Order of Police, the Utah Education Association, Professional Firefighters of Utah, Teamsters Local 222, the Salt Lake Valley Law Enforcement Association, United Mine Workers and more. 
“To the sponsors and supporters of HB267, you are not representing the best interest of public employees or your constituents,” said Kevin Murray, president of the Utah State Fraternal Order of Police. “The groundswell of support we’ve seen during this signature gathering event makes one thing clear— this community stands united, and we will be heard.”

Since the effort began on March 15, roughly 5,000 union members and volunteers have hit the streets, gathering signatures at coffee shops, grocery stores, museums, college campuses, congressional town halls, bus stops, tattoo parlors, TRAX stations, sporting events and protests. Over 30 days, they collected nearly 10,600 signatures each day. 
“This is what solidarity looks like, a coalition of 19 labor unions came together: firefighters, police officers, educators, nurses, miners, food workers, all in support of this. We knocked doors, hosted events, braved bad weather just to spread the word. And we could not have done it without everyone who stepped up,” said Donnavan Minutes, a firefighter for Salt Lake City.

Combined with the 640 million acres of federal public lands in the United States, our nation’s hunters and anglers have unparalleled opportunities to pursue fish and game without relying upon private landowners for access. However, sportsmen and women cite lack of access as the No. 1 obstacle to continuing our sporting traditions. Without these public lands hunters will be next on the endangered species list.

Surveys by the Congressional Sportsmen Foundation have found that over 90% of Colorado hunters use public lands. Public lands habitat is the Titanic that keeps hunting afloat, but it’s sinking. People have been trying to steal our great public lands estate since Theodore Roosevelt (and others) set it aside. Unfortunately, those efforts have shifted into high gear recently. After his February confirmation, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued a series of orders prioritizing public lands energy development and mining.
Kaden McArthur, policy and government relations director for Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, said Burgum’s orders discount input from hunters, anglers and other stakeholders. Then, in March, Burgum proposed fixing America’s affordable housing problem by selling off public lands for development, Outdoor Life news editor Dac Collins explained.
In reality, it’s a thinly veiled disguise to dispose of public lands. And as sportsmen and women know from boots-on-the-ground experience, nothing locks up land like privatization. “This is just one step of many that we’ve seen toward the commodification and development of our public lands,” McArthur told Outdoor Life.
“This idea that our federal lands are a cure-all to the nation’s housing problems is a farce,” Collins added. “The root cause of the affordable housing crisis is a lack of affordable units, not a lack of developable land.”
In addition, the vast majority of federal lands are far removed from the metropolitan areas where affordable housing is most needed. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are currently 15.1 million vacant housing units in the United States, reinforcing the idea that housing availability is not the main issue.
A July 2023 News Tribune op-ed noted that institutional buyers — companies, corporations or limited liability companies — made up 13% of the residential real estate sales market in 2021. Cory Ure, at SecurityNational Mortgage Co. in Salt Lake City, was quoted as saying, “Even some very qualified buyers couldn’t compete against these investors, especially these big pension funds and hedge funds coming in and paying way over value.”
Collins says the federal government could play a big role in making housing more affordable by enacting policies that bring down housing costs, such as preventing corporations and private equity firms from buying up single-family homes, and incentivizing the construction of affordable homes over luxury apartments and high-end subdivisions.
“As sportsmen and women, we must remain vigilant. Once public land is sold, it’s lost forever,” McArthur added. “We shouldn’t trade an irreplaceable resource — our public lands — for irreversible development.” This is why BHA strongly supports the bipartisan Public Lands in Public Hands Act, which would reduce the ability for federal land management agencies to dispose of the lands owned by all Americans.
Many of us come from multi-generational families of hunters and/or military veterans and, as such, we have embraced the immense responsibility of protecting public lands and democracy. Diminishing any wild public lands, waters and wildlife anywhere speaks to a fundamental disregard for the hunters, anglers, and the servicemembers and veterans of this great nation.
Public lands are not a left or right issue, they’re an American issue.
“To be clear: Once these landscapes are gone and out of the federal estate, they’re never coming back,” McArthur emphasized.
And I didn’t spend 15 years of my life in military training and service to let a bunch of billionaire buzzards and oligarch wannabes waltz in and take them without a fight. At BHA we’re not backing down.

Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) speaks about how advocates can convince Republicans to fund the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program at the Great Lakes Audubon Society's 2025 advocacy day. (Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) said Wednesday the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program is “on life support,” adding that some of his Republican colleagues give it a 20% chance of being extended in this year’s budget debate before its expiration next year. 
Kurtz, Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine), Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) and Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Secretary Karen Hyun spoke Wednesday to a gathering of members of local Audubon Society chapters and staff of Audubon Great Lakes ahead of the organization’s advocacy day to lobby legislators to support conservation funding. 
The Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program was established in 1989 to help preserve local natural environments. Throughout its history, the program has enjoyed mostly bipartisan support as it has provided grants through the DNR to help local governments and nonprofits fund the acquisition, restoration and maintenance of public land, parks and wildlife habitats. 
In recent years, the program has become a flashpoint in the fight over the boundary between the executive and legislative branches of state government. Until a decision by the state Supreme Court last year, any member of the Legislature’s powerful Joint Committee on Finance had the authority to hold up a project funded through the stewardship program by placing an anonymous hold on that spending. 
The Court’s decision entirely removed the Legislature’s oversight of the program, a change that further turned Republicans against its continued existence. 
“We could make that process better, where it was not just one individual not liking something and being able to kill a project. I agree with that,” Kurtz said. “When the court case came in and basically took that entire process away, that was not good either, because there was no oversight. And I understand some of you believe whatever the DNR does is fine. That’s great. Some of my colleagues don’t believe that.”
Especially in the northern part of the state, Republicans have objected to stewardship funds being used to conserve land that then gets taken off of local property tax rolls — taking money away from already struggling small local governments. In other cases, Republicans have complained that proposals for projects under the grants rely too heavily on the state funds without the local governments providing enough of their own money. 
In his proposed 2025-26 budget, Gov. Tony Evers has requested the stewardship program be increased from its current funding of $33 million per year to $100 million per year for 10 years. 
Kurtz said he’s working on a bill that would return some oversight authority over the program to the Legislature without the anonymous objection provision. He added, though,  that if the Audubon members went to Republicans Wednesday saying, “‘It’s the governor’s budget or nothing,’ you already lost.” 
“I don’t need you to do that, because, I’m being very sincere, I’m trying to keep this alive, and if you go over there [saying that], there’s a good chance it’ll die,” he said. “So don’t do that. Let them, especially when you’re meeting with my colleagues, ask them what [their] concerns are. ‘Why don’t you like this? What is it about the program that we can do better so we can have another day to make sure we protect all our wonderful birds and animals.’”
Habush Sinykin noted that 93% of Wisconsinites support the program and said that in her purple district covering Milwaukee’s northwest suburbs, the stewardship program is hugely popular. She said the anonymous hold of a project in the district drew the ire of community members of both parties. 
“There’s a lot of understanding at the legislative level that in these uncertain times, with these newer maps, that our state representatives and senators, including those on the Joint Finance Committee, have to be wary and strategic about issues like this that are bipartisan,” she said. “They’re actually non-partisan. They are successful community building issues. So I think that’s a little bit where your leverage is to lean in hard. How popular these are.”
Aside from the stewardship program, the society members lobbying in the Capitol Wednesday were pushing for the state to increase protections for wetlands and grasslands, advance sustainable practices in the state’s agriculture and forestry industries and grow renewable energy production. 
On Wednesday morning, the administration of President Donald Trump announced a proposed rule that would rescind habitat protections for endangered species across the country. 
Marnie Urso, Audubon Great Lakes’ senior director of policy, said that with the federal government retreating from conservation efforts, state level efforts have become more important. 
“With that uncertainty, this kind of work is even more important, for state lawmakers to be on the path to conserving our natural resources,” Urso said. “The Knowles Nelson project program is bipartisan. It always has been a permanent foundation. So we know it has wide, widespread bipartisan support.”
Urso said leaning into that popularity could help advance the group’s priorities. 
“Even Trump voters like the Knowles Nelson Conservation Fund,” she said. “So we’re confident that by coming and talking, telling our story and getting to understand what’s important to our lawmakers, we can inform those decisions. And now it’s more important than ever to have state conservation programs continue.”

(Sarah Jane Tribble/KFF Health News)Louisiana students who qualify for TOPS tuition awards but attend college out of state could still get that money if they decide to return home for medical or dental school. The legislature is considering a measure to lure them back home, but with conditions.
House Bill 275 by Rep. Stephanie Berault, R-Slidell, would require those students to pay back the aid unless they work full time in their field in Louisiana for at least three consecutive years after graduation. 
The proposal is aimed at addressing a physician shortage in Louisiana, where the Cicero Institute reports 60 out of 64 parishes have a shortage of health care professionals. 
The bill has the support of Gov. Jeff Landry and was unanimously approved Wednesday by the House Education Committee. 
TOPS, short for the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, is a merit-based scholarship program that helps Louisiana students attend in-state colleges and universities.
About 34 new medical and dental school students each year will qualify for TOPS under the legislation, according to a cost estimate for the bill. The cost will gradually increase over four years, when it is forecasted to level out at about $1.3 million annually. 
Berault has also proposed House Bill 539, which would create a student loan repayment program for doctors who practice in Louisiana’s rural areas. It has not yet been scheduled for a hearing.

(Photo by Creatas/ Getty Images Plus)Lawmakers held a public hearing Wednesday afternoon for a bipartisan proposal to protect people who enter into an agreement to hold firearms for someone else. 
Rep. Vicki Doudera (D-Camden) introduced the legislation during a public hearing with the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee that included three other bills about hold agreements, secure storage and keeping firearms in unoccupied vehicles. Earlier in the day, the committee also heard proposals to repeal the state’s 72-hour waiting period and background check requirement for private sales. 
This is the second wave of gun legislation before the committee this session. The committee already rejected proposals to amend Maine’s concealed carry laws, while legislation seeking to address large-capacity magazines divided Democrats. 
Gun rights advocates were largely supportive of the bills regarding hold agreements, so long as they were voluntary agreements, but pushed back on the storage proposals with concerns that they penalize law-abiding citizens and victims of crimes. 
Under a firearms hold agreement, LD 1104 would offer legal protection for the person who agrees to hold a firearm for someone else. The legislation would give the holder immunity after the firearm is returned, unless their conduct is otherwise unlawful. 
Doudera said she imagined people may want to utilize an agreement like this in a variety of scenarios. For example, when selling a house and people are touring, or when grandchildren are visiting, or during tumultuous personal times such as divorce. 
However, Doudera said she actually prefers the language in a similar proposal from Rep. Steven Wood (R-Greene), LD 1174.
That bill would also give a gun shop immunity when taking possession of a firearm owned by a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces or first responders under a firearm hold agreement. The parties would need to have contact every six months and the firearm would need to be stored separately from the shop’s inventory.
Wood envisioned his bill being a tool for those populations when they are in crisis; however, Rep. Dani O’Halloran (D-Brewer) wondered if a gun shop is the appropriate entity to deal with those individuals when they are in crisis. 
Doudera said her only issue with the bill is that she would like to see it extended to the general population, not just veterans and first responders. Wood said the gun shop owners he spoke with were concerned they wouldn’t have enough capacity to offer that service so broadly. 
The committee also asked questions about how these proposals would comply with certain federal regulations on how gun shops are required to manage their inventory and when they need to conduct background checks when transferring firearms. 
Proposals about firearm storage
There were also two proposals about how and where firearms can be stored. 
Under current law, it is a Class D crime to store a loaded firearm in a way that allows children under 16 to gain access to them without permission. Rep. Dan Sayre (D-Kennebunk) wants to expand those laws so someone is liable if their negligent storage leads to a person who is prohibited from possessing a firearm gains access to one.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
LD 1120 would make it a Class D crime to store a firearm in a way that a minor or a prohibited person could gain access and use it in a crime or display it in a threatening manner. It would be a more serious Class C crime if the firearm is used to kill someone or cause serious bodily harm.
Class D crimes are punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a $2,000 fine, while for Class C crimes that increases to five years and $5,000.  
Sayre said his bill doesn’t infringe on the right to own a gun, but offers “additional incentives for all owners to do what responsible owners are doing already” in regards to storage. He said the gun owners would be held liable if they knew a minor or prohibited person was likely to gain access. 
The Maine chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics supported the storage bills, seeing it as a way to prevent accidental injury and death, especially of children. 
Sayre’s bill includes a third component to require licensed firearm dealers to post a notice in areas where guns are sold or transferred stating that access to a firearm in the home significantly increases the risk of suicide, death during domestic violence disputes and unintentional death of children.
There was also a proposal from Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Portland) that she said is designed to address the theft of handguns from vehicles without penalizing people who have their cars broken into. LD 1299 would prohibit a person from storing a handgun in an unoccupied vehicle, unless it is out of plain view and locked specifically in a hard-sided container with the car locked. 
It includes exceptions for law enforcement, active military members and certain hunting activities. It also outlines a civil penalty for violation.
Other committee members, as well as gun rights organizations, raised questions about how effective a hard-side container is if cheap ones can be easily broken or simply taken, in comparison to a locked glove compartment that someone couldn’t remove from the car. 
While Justin Davis, state director for the National Rifle Association, said he supports safe storage and reducing gun thefts, he doesn’t believe these bills are the appropriate vehicles because he argued they are not fair to gun owners who are victims of a crime.

The bill requires local school boards to adopt a policy to store student cell phones during class hours. Some schools use Yondr Pouches to store phones, but the legislation does not specify how a phone should be stored. 
“They just have to turn the phone off, store it off your person in a locker, car, whatever your storage solution is, it’s a similar solution. Whatever they choose,” Hulsey said.
There are three exceptions for when a student can access their phones: if they study under an Individualized Education Plan that allows it; for teacher-approved instruction and for medical purposes.
The bill was approved with no discussion. It moves to the full House for consideration.

Both Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) and Rep. Tavis Hasenfus (D-Readfield) presented proposals to the Taxation Committee on Wednesday to create income tax credits for employer-supported child care, though to slightly varying degrees.  
“Lack of affordable childcare affects parents’ ability to accept a job, maintain steady employment or reduce the number of hours they can work,” Stewart said. “This all impacts our economic growth as a state. We can do better on this.”
Stewart’s legislation, LD 203, would authorize an annual credit of 50% of the amount spent on child care, or $3,000 per child, whichever is lower. 
Hasenfus amended his legislation, LD 1555, to authorize the same amounts. However, Hasenfus’ version also has a per business cap of $36,000, which he said is intended to ensure the credit isn’t used without end and to give a leg up to small businesses.
“Small businesses in Maine also often struggle to match the larger businesses and the benefits that larger businesses are able to offer,” Hasenfus said. 
The bills also differ on how long unused credits could be carried over. Stewart’s legislation permits carry over for up to 15 years, whereas Hasenfus’ version is only up to five years. Both bills stipulate that the credit would be subject to ongoing legislative review starting in 2030. 
While the bill sponsors and members of the public who testified in support of the bills said a lack of affordable and available childcare is an issue across the state, they particularly highlighted the challenges in rural areas. 
According to a study from the Bipartisan Policy Center, since 2019, 81 licensed child care providers in Aroostook County have closed, while only 38 providers have opened, resulting in a net loss of care for at least 516 children. There are only 84 licensed providers across the County.
Just in March, a large child care facility in Presque Isle that served 71 children and 20 infants closed, with zero infant care available at any center nearby, said Readfield resident Krysta West, who is the deputy director of the Maine Forest industry Council. 
West said members of the council commonly cite the lack of child care as a reason they’re unable to attract employees and some have therefore taken it upon themselves to fill that gap. For example, Maine Woods and its parent company, Seven Islands, has begun the process of setting up the “Little Saplings” child care center in Aroostook County.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Making visions such as Little Saplings become a reality requires substantial investment,” West said. “Although they’ve stepped up to invest in child care needs, public private partnerships and new policy solutions are desperately needed to ensure that these ventures remain viable.”
States have taken varying approaches to address childcare affordability. New Mexico became the first state to offer free child care to families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level, or about $124,000 for a family of four. Nearby Massachusetts and Rhode Island use the subsidy approach, providing financial assistance to help families pay for child care programs.
Some do not think tax credits are the solution. 
Maura Pillsbury, tax policy analyst for the progressive Maine Center for Economic Policy, argued the state should instead reinforce and build on what it’s already done — investments that lawmakers are also currently weighing whether to reverse at the request of the governor to help fill the budget deficit. 
In 2021, Maine started providing $200 stipends per child care worker to help alleviate worker shortages during the height of the pandemic. 
Those monthly stipends doubled as part of the $59 million allocation to overhaul child care in the last biennial budget, spearheaded by former Senate President Troy Jackson (D-Aroostook). The package also expanded eligibility for the Child Care Affordability Program, which provides child care subsidies. The Mills administration had initially opposed Jackson’s plan because of an expectation that funding for it would be inadequate.
This year, Gov. Janet Mills suggested reversing those recent investments by cutting $30 million for child care worker stipends to bring them back to 2022 levels, among other funding reductions to services such as Head Start.
Pillsbury requested lawmakers instead reject these cuts, arguing tax breaks for businesses are less efficient and equitable than providing direct subsidies.
“If we want to attract and retain more people in a career that prepares our youngest residents for success and gives workers in every corner of our state the chance to stay in their jobs, we must do better by them,” Pillsbury said.
Questions raised by Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) suggested she may be opposed to the tax credit approach but for different reasons. “Why should I and other seniors like me, who had to pay for our own childcare and didn’t get these credits, now have to pay?” Rudnicki asked.
Referring to home day care options, Rudnicki also questioned whether it would be more effective to loosen child care regulations instead.
“Is this really the best way to go about this?”
West argued it is. “It gives employers flexibility to pursue the needs of their local community,” she responded.
Rudnicki similarly suggested licensing changes during the hearing for a bill to increase the state’s child tax credit. That plan from Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) to double the state’s child tax credit for children under six years old would be paid for by phasing out the benefit for the state’s highest earners.
During that hearing, child care providers argued that loosening restrictions would damage the quality of the care and that liability insurance would likely refuse to insure providers.

The Trump administration on Wednesday sued Maine over policies that allow some trans athletes to compete in women’s sports. Bondi said Maine is violating federal law intended to prevent discrimination based on sex. 
The administration is asking the court to bar Maine trans athletes from participating in women’s sports and asking the court to “have the titles returned to the young women who rightfully won these sports,” Bondi said.
“We’re looking at Minnesota. We’re looking at California. We’re looking at many, many states but they are the top two that should be on notice because we’ve been communicating with them,” Bondi said during a news conference.
In February, Trump signed an executive order barring trans athletes from playing girls and women’s sports. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison issued a formal legal opinion that states barring trans athlete participation would violate the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which supersedes Trump’s executive order.
Bondi in February warned Ellison that the Justice Department is prepared to sue the state over its trans athlete policy.
The U.S. Department of Education is investigating the Minnesota State High School League for publicly announcing it would not comply with Trump’s executive order because it’s subject to state anti-discrimination laws, which prohibits discrimination based on gender identity.
The Trump administration has threatened to cut off funding for Maine’s public schools and school lunch programs, and the Justice Department clawed back $1.5 million in grants from Maine’s Corrections Department for allowing a trans prisoner in a women’s prison.

Screenshot from Fort Benning livestream Fort Benning’s name has officially been restored after a two-year stint as Fort Moore that was part of a national move away from Confederate namesakes. 
But the Pentagon says the Army post near Columbus is now named for a different Benning – World War I veteran Fred Benning of Nebraska, an Army corporal who enlisted when he was 17 and served in the First Infantry Division. Originally, Confederate Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning, who fought to preserve slavery, was the Benning being honored.
New signage was unveiled Wednesday during a renaming ceremony at the base, which is one of the country’s largest installations. Fred Benning’s granddaughter was there, sharing memories of her grandfather. 
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed a memo renaming the base last month, saying at the time in a short video statement that “now Fort Benning is back too.” The move followed the return of Fort Bragg’s name in North Carolina, in that case going with Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, a World War II veteran, as the new namesake instead of Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg.
The updated names had been the work of a commission on renaming bases honoring Confederates created by Congress, and that commission was part of a defense authorization bill that had enough support in 2020 to override President Donald Trump’s veto during his first term.
Georgia’s Fort Gordon near Augusta was also renamed Fort Eisenhower in 2023 after General of the Army and U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower as part of that push. The original name had honored John B. Gordon, a major general in the Confederate army who went on to serve as Georgia governor and U.S. senator. 
In 2023, Fort Benning had been renamed Fort Moore in honor of Lt. Gen. Hal and Julia Moore. During the Vietnam War, while Hal Moore was deployed, Julia worked to change the way the U.S. military handled death notifications. At the time, they were delivered by cabbies carrying a telegram. The couple is buried at the post’s military cemetery.
“Both Hal and Julia Moore remarkably served our country and raised the standard of excellence in the United States Army for servicemen and civilian spouses alike. I am proud that a military base in Georgia was chosen to bear their name, even briefly,” state Sen. Ed Harbison, a Columbus Democrat and military veteran, said shortly after the renaming was announced.
Others were more critical of the change.
“The American people understand the legacy connected to the original name, and Secretary Hegseth’s disingenuous attempt to associate it to a separate soldier is transparent and distasteful,” Margaret Huang, president and CEO Southern Poverty Law Center, said in response to the news last month. 
Maj. Gen. Colin Tuley, who is the commanding general of the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning, said in public remarks Wednesday that Fred Benning’s life will serve as an inspiration for the thousands of soldiers who train there every year.
Fred Benning was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for “extraordinary heroism in action” in 1918 south of Exermont, France. He took command after his platoon commander was killed and two senior non-commissioned officers were injured. When he returned home, he operated a bakery and later served as mayor of Neligh, Nebraska.
“As we rededicate this post in his honor, may we all strive to embody the very same tenets he exemplified: unwavering dedication to people, inspirational leadership, a relentless pursuit of transformation,” Tuley said. “(His) story reminds us that true heroism is not just defined by rank. It is about that unwavering courage, that selfless service and an enduring commitment to something greater than ourselves.”

SPRINGFIELD — When Elizabeth Pollock took over as the Champaign County public defender in 2022, one of her team’s attorneys was handling 500 cases by herself in a courtroom that should have been staffed by at least three public defenders.

“That is a recipe for disaster because it’s not just taxing on the attorney, but it means that the client(s) who that attorney is representing are not able to speak with her in a timely fashion; they’re not able to review their cases with her in a timely fashion,” Pollock said in an interview. “We’re talking about months of delay in terms of meeting with attorneys and getting results.”

With many county public defender offices pushed to the limits throughout Illinois, state lawmakers are moving forward on legislation to create a statewide public defender office.

Many public defender offices in Illinois, especially in rural areas, are in desperate need of resources to provide adequate defense services. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1963 on Gideon v. Wainright that anyone accused of a crime has a right to a defense attorney, setting the basis for public defenders that judges often assign to defendants to represent a person for free.

A 2021 report commissioned by the Illinois Supreme Court examined nine counties of varying sizes and found each one lacked necessary resources to provide defendants proper legal representation because of high caseloads, a lack of state oversight and long wait times to obtain a lawyer. A task force created after that report recommended Illinois fully fund public defense services and establish a statewide office that provides administrative oversight and resources.

Demand for public defense attorneys has increased in the two years since the Pretrial Fairness Act took effect in 2023. That law requires more in-depth evidence and arguments during first appearance hearings than under the old bond system, where first appearance hearings often lasted just a few minutes while a judge set a bond. Now detention hearings are required to take place within 72 hours of an arrest, meaning public defender services are often needed right away to review early evidence in cases.

Legislation in front of the General Assembly would create the “Office of State Public Defender” which would primarily be responsible for providing public defender offices around the state with more resources. House Bill 3363 passed the House last week on a 72-41 vote. It now heads to the Senate where President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, has tried to pass similar legislation in recent years.

Illinois has already established similar offices to improve other aspects of criminal court processes, including the Office of State Appellate Defender and the Office of Statewide Pretrial Services.

First steps for the office

If lawmakers approve the bill, the office may provide public defense services — but not for several years. Over the first few years, the office’s primary responsibility would be to assess the needs of public defenders in Illinois and collect data about their workloads.

“We are really lacking any type of data gathering across public defender offices in the state of Illinois because we just have never had the resources to really even count the number of cases that we have,” Pollock said.

The data gathered would guide decision making about where the money should be spent and what types of resources — from more attorneys to case investigators — public defender offices should receive.

The state has appropriated $10 million for public defense services via a fund established in 2023. State funding would provide greater equity for public defenders throughout the state, which typically receive funding from their counties, Pollock said.

“County by county, the budget depends on what that county can provide, and some counties don’t have as much revenue as others and so they just simply cannot afford to provide the resources that the public defenders need to do their jobs,” she said.

Limited data shows all Illinois counties need more public defenders. According to an analysis of county public defender budgets compiled by Northwestern University, no Illinois counties have “sufficient” staffing in public defender offices.

Some positions in public defender offices aren’t filled at all, including 83% of counties that don’t have any investigators in public defender offices, according to researchers.

Most other states also have some level of state oversight and are the primary funding source for public defenders. Illinois doesn’t fall into either category.

The bill would require counties to bump up salaries for public defenders from 90% to 95% of a state’s attorney’s salary, something proponents say will help improve recruitment and retention.

Appointing public defenders

Another key provision of the bill would change how public defenders are selected. Outside of Cook County, top county judges appoint or remove public defenders. Under the bill, a local nominating committee would be tasked with appointing or removing public defenders, which is designed to give the public defenders more independence from the judiciary.

“You’re now arguing in front of a judge who hires you and a judge who fires you, potentially. Whereas a state’s attorney is an elected official and a judge has no power over him or her and no power over their budget,” bill sponsor Rep. Dave Vella, D-Rockford, said in an interview.

Chief judges could still be part of the local committees appointing public defenders, however. But their voice would be one of between four and six members of the commission that selects a county’s public defender. Other local commission members would include attorneys, representatives of law schools or legal professional organizations and former public defender clients.

For now, that process would not be required for counties with fewer than 35,000 people as those counties typically rely on contract attorneys for public defense that split their time in multiple counties. State law currently doesn’t require those smaller counties, which account for more than half of the state’s 102 counties, to have public defender offices. Cook County already has its own appointment process different from the rest of the state.

“The problem is the appearance of impropriety,” Vella said. “We have a system right now in Illinois and in America where defendants and people who are in the system are starting to have some real questions about the fairness of the system.”

Pollock explained it makes sense that judges are part of the process because they see the attorneys perform in the courtroom and might be able to tell who would make a good public defender. But the problem is it could create an appearance for defendants that their public defender might change how they represent someone to make their “boss” — the chief judge — happy.

Former Madison County Public Defender John Rekowski disagreed.

“The judges are in the best position to know the local landscape and know the local bench, know the local climate and pick the person who should furnish those services,” Rekowski said in an interview.

Rekowski and the Illinois State Bar Association are proposing that judges continue appointing the public defender, but the commission has the power to remove the public defender or reappoint the public defender to a new term.  Rekowski said limiting the judge’s power over public defenders to just their first appointment removes “any possibility (of) some kind of retribution or intimidation.”

The bill is likely to go through more changes as it heads to the Senate for consideration.

(Photo by Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Quinn Hurt/Department of Defense)Jessica Henninger wants to protect her children from the political climate that briefly closed their school library at Fort Campbell and led to books being removed from the shelves. 
“There’s a very fine line between having your children be aware of what’s going on in the world around them, and not burdening them with adult things,” Henninger said. “But … when (Black History Month) projects are canceled after you’ve completed them … they notice that stuff.” 
Citing her husband’s military service and their joint devotion to the U.S. Constitution, Henninger has joined a federal lawsuit on behalf of her children, citing First Amendment concerns and asking the courts to block President Donald Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders in schools operated by the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA). Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is a defendant.
Book purges at Fort Campbell, other schools run by Defense Department challenged as unconstitutional

Henninger has five children: two have graduated from DODEA schools and three are still students, named in the lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed Tuesday. That suit challenges U.S. Department of Defense policies that led to schools at Fort Campbell and other military bases removing books about slavery and civil rights. 
Henninger, whose husband is in the military and is stationed at Fort Campbell, has lived in Kentucky since October. 
Before that, in all their travels, “I can’t recall a time in our years at DODEA where my children’s curriculum was affected by anything that was going on in the presidency,” Henninger told a small group of reporters over Zoom on Wednesday. 
“We owe our children to be honest,” she said. “I’m very fearful that these actions (are) trying to take away my children’s opportunities to learn about integral parts of our history, our American history … and different cultures. That’s what makes education — and life — rich. It’s all of those differences. My younger children … they deserve the right to learn about that stuff.” 
The lawsuit: ‘Books shouldn’t be banned’ 
Via executive order Trump directed schools receiving federal funding to not teach “ideology that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as individuals;” he also told the Armed Forces to dissolve DEI offices and directed all federal agencies to recognize only cisgender male and female identities.  
In February, Clarksville Now, a news outlet in Clarksville, Tennessee, reported Fort Campbell librarians were busy “scrubbing for books that contain references to slavery, the civil rights movement and anything else related to diversity, equity and inclusion” in compliance with Trump’s orders. 
Fort Campbell is an Army base that spans the Kentucky-Tennessee border between Hopkinsville and Clarksville.
Fort Campbell schools also had to remove “bulletin boards that reference Black History Month and Black leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks,” according to Clarksville Now. 
Corey Shapiro, legal director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said Wednesday he hopes for a preliminary injunction to “get some relief sooner rather than later from the court.” 
“We’re still evaluating exactly the timing on next steps and building that out,” he said. 
He also wants to see more transparency around which books are removed from shelves, and where those books go. 
But, he asserted: “none of these books should be taken out.” 
“To some extent, it doesn’t really matter whether we have a list or sort of engage in a debate on which individual book is the appropriate thing,” Shapiro said. “The issue here is that books shouldn’t be banned from school libraries. Kids should have an opportunity to have access to all the books in the school library without fear that somebody in the Department of Defense is going to determine that it shouldn’t be there based on an executive order regarding a ban on certain types of viewpoints.” 
‘I could not abide’ 
Soon after the executive orders, Henninger “started getting emails from the kids’ teachers, basically that just made me think that there was something going on.” 
She got “notifications that assignments were being canceled, then that the library just unexpectedly closed down.” 
She immediately started investigating, contacted the ACLU to help and ultimately joined the multi-state federal lawsuit in an attempt to block the Trump administration from carrying out the anti-DEI orders. 
“I have a very strong belief that children should have access to books,” said Henninger, who is herself a “voracious reader.” 
“When I was a child, I read. That’s how I learned about the world around me. It’s how I learned about other people and life experiences outside of my own,” she said. “And I feel like that is an important part of being able to understand other people. And to have those options taken away from my children was something that I have never experienced before.” 
All her children, too, love books, she said. 
“We’ve never had an administration come in and interfere in this way with our children’s education,” she said. “My husband fights for our constitutional rights and our freedoms in this country, and to see those rights being taken away from my children was just absolutely something that I could not abide.” 
After the lawsuit was filed, Michael O’Day, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense Education Activity, said he couldn’t comment on an active lawsuit but offered praise for the agency’s “dedication to providing an exceptional educational experience for every student.” More than 67,000 students worldwide are enrolled in schools run by the DODEA.
“Our curriculum, rigorously aligned with DoDEA’s proven standards, has earned us the distinction of being the top-ranked school system in the United States for four consecutive years, based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the Nation’s Report Card,” O’Day said in a statement. “These standards promote academic excellence, critical thinking, and a learning environment that empowers all military-connected students to excel.”
Henninger attributes the success in part to the diversity of the student body.
“I think part of this strength is our diversity — the diversity of people that come together and we learn from each other, and that’s part of our strength,” she said. “And so to see that potentially being taken away from my younger children? That’s harmful.”  
She believes the executive orders are politically motivated and cited the Trump administration’s deportations of immigrants, saying his presidential campaign was “propped on” immigration issues. 
“And then when you see them coming into the libraries and removing those items … common sense would dictate that two plus two equals four. That’s definitely politically motivated,” she said. 
‘We can’t whitewash’ history 
For military families like Henninger’s, DODEA schools are often the only option, though that can vary based on where a soldier is stationed. Private education is expensive. Henninger’s best path was to fight back within the DODEA system,  she said. 
Other plaintiffs represented by the ACLU are enrolled in Defense Department schools in Virginia, Italy and Japan. 
“We don’t have a lot of the same recourses that that families have in the public education system. We can’t just go to our school board and and say, ‘This is unacceptable.’ We very much have to worry about retaliation and retribution. And so there’s a lot of stress and anxiety around that for a lot of people, which is understandable,” Henninger said.
She and her husband talked about the risks of joining such a lawsuit and ultimately decided she had to.
“Basically what it boiled down to (for my husband) was: ‘I joined the military to defend the Constitution, and if I can’t defend our children’s constitutional rights, then what am I doing as a soldier?'”
Her children “have their First Amendment rights just like everybody else. It’s not fair to them just because their father is a soldier that they shouldn’t be able to have the same rights as everybody else.” 
She wants her children to learn about the full history of their country, including the “not so pretty parts: the Trail of Tears and slavery and the fight for civil rights.” 
“It is our true history,” she said. “And we can’t whitewash that away.”

The product of a secret search, he lasted for less than one year.In the face of a threatened veto from Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida House passed a bill Wednesday with widespread member support that would reopen presidential searches to public scrutiny. 
Representatives voted 104-8 on HB 1321, introduced by Rep. Michelle Salzman and decried by DeSantis, which would repeal the public records exemption on applicants for presidencies at state colleges and universities. 
“In summary, this bill is about transparency, term limiting bureaucrats, and good governance,” Salzman said on the House floor Wednesday.

The bill would prohibit the governor’s office from influencing who might lead the institutions and  remove the Board of Governors’ required approval of finalists presented by search committees. The bill would leave searches to boards of trustees of individual universities, which typically include more local stakeholders. 
“This isn’t an attack on the Board of Governors. This isn’t an attack on our great governor. This is simply bringing the second largest component of the state budget into the sunshine,” Salzman said. 
During a news conference about law enforcement in Fort Myers on Wednesday, DeSantis said the bill would “kneecap our ability to hold higher ed accountable.”
“I don’t think that’s gonna get on the desk. If it does, we’ll invite you all to the ceremony where we’ll veto. That’s fine, but I don’t even think it’s gonna get there,” DeSantis said. 
University presidential search laws are a major topic inside the Florida Capitol

SB 1726, the bill’s Senate companion with material differences including keeping searches secret, awaits its final committee stop in the Rules Committee. It received unanimous approval in its previous two committee stops. 
Bills need two-thirds support in each chamber to override a veto. 
Among the votes against the bill, seven were Republicans: Reps. Kiyan Michael, Patt Maney, Chip LaMarca, Ryan Chamberlin, Mike Caruso, and Tom Fabricio. Rep. John Temple voted late against the bill. Democrat Yvonne Hinson also voted no.
Caruso consistently has been willing to stand with the governor while the House has deviated from the executive branch’s wishes this session. 
“Public colleges and universities are funded by taxpayers from the entire state of Florida, so the state has a vested interest in overseeing leadership choices. Having the State Board of Education approve appointments ensures that presidents are held to statewide priorities, not just internal or local interest,” Caruso, the only representative to speak in opposition to the bill on the floor, said. 
Caruso made the argument that Salzman’s bill “unravels all the success we’ve made over the years in higher education,” an argument DeSantis has also made. 
DeSantis called the bill “ill-conceived” during a news conference in Pensacola on Tuesday about Hope Florida. 
Recent searches
While Florida has been ranked the best higher education system in the nation for the last eight years by U.S. News & World Report, presidential searches have faced controversy in recent years. 
Ben Sasse was the sole finalist announced for the presidency at University of Florida after a secret search. Sasse held the job for less than a year and was criticized for lavish spending while in the office. 
Florida Atlantic University restarted a secret search after the governor’s office tried and ultimately failed to position then-state Rep. Randy Fine for the job.
The governor’s office reached out to Florida International University to advocate for Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez to take their interim presidency. 
Former House Speaker Richard Corcoran was named president at New College of Florida, perhaps the first and most widely publicized instance of a DeSantis political ally being named leader of a SUS institution. 
Among the aforementioned provisions, the bill would impose term limits for the Board of Education, Board of Governors, and university and college trustees and require that members would have to be alumni of the institution or residents of Florida.

Brad Little gives a press conference after delivering his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6 in the Lincoln Auditorium in the Idaho Capitol. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho will try to ban a food assistance program from covering candy and soda.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law House Bill 109, which requires the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to seek federal approval to exclude candy and soda from foods eligible for coverage by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Idaho’s bill is part of the national movement known as “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, promoted by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the bill’s cosponsor Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene has told lawmakers.
“Idaho welcomes the MAHA movement. It is all about looking for creative ways to improve nutrition and increase exercise, the two main factors that influence overall health,” Little wrote in a prepared statement Tuesday. “Secretary Kennedy said it so well: we need to take better care of ourselves and each other. He said it is an act of patriotism, and the future of our nation depends on it. Idaho couldn’t agree more.”
In Utah, lawmakers approved and Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill seeking to prohibit soda purchases under SNAP in the Beehive State. Kennedy visited Salt Lake City last week to celebrate the bill, along with other “Make America Healthy Again” legislation passed in Utah.
 How will the SNAP bill affect local retailers?

Business industry representatives oppose the bill. Arguing the bill wouldn’t be workable, Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said it would cause grocery stores to stop accepting SNAP.
But bill cosponsor Senate Majority Caucus Chair Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, says he’s skeptical the bill would be hard on retailers. He said the bill’s candy definition is used in 24 other states’ sales tax laws.
Idaho’s new law takes effect July 1.
In a prepared statement, Washington, DC.-based nonprofit Food Research & Action Center SNAP Deputy Director Gina Plata-Nino critiqued SNAP restrictions, saying they “only deepen food insecurity and strip people of their autonomy.”
“This push to restrict what Idaho households can buy is an ill-conceived, recycled attempt to shame people who need food assistance and strip them of their dignity and autonomy when data shows that their diet isn’t much different from anyone else’s,” Plata-Nino told the Idaho Capital Sun.
Little signed the bill into law on Tuesday, the governor’s office announced in a news release. The bill passed the Idaho House on a 48-20 vote, after passing the Senate on a 25-10 vote with amendments.
In the Idaho governor’s office news release announcing Little signed the bill, Kennedy wrote in a prepared statement, “I urge all governors to follow Idaho’s lead and submit innovative SNAP waivers to the USDA to reverse the childhood chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”
 Bill’s candy definition is broad, and would ban granola and power bars, critics say

Pushback has largely focused on the bill’s broad candy definition, which critics say would also ban granola bars and power bars.
The bill defines candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners combined with chocolate, fruit, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings” in several forms.
Under the bill, candy would not include items that contain flour or need refrigeration. The Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition, removing an exemption for items with more than 10% flour by weight.
The bill’s soda definition also appears to be broad.
Under the bill, soda includes nonalcoholic beverages with sweeteners, artificial or natural. But the bill doesn’t consider soda to be drinks with more than 50% juice, containing milk or milk substitutes, or that need preparation, such as powders or concentrates.
About 132,000 Idahoans are enrolled in SNAP, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare figures, receiving an average of $177 in monthly program benefits.
If the federal U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, doesn’t grant Idaho’s candy/soda SNAP ban waiver, the bill says Health and Welfare “shall request such a waiver annually until such a waiver is granted.”
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would not have a fiscal impact on the state budget.
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement she was excited more states “are heeding the call to Make America Healthy Again.”
“Governor Little is a true partner to USDA, and we look forward to working together on ways to use SNAP to improve health outcomes for Americans and encourage better use of taxpayer dollars,” she added.

Members of the House on Monday voted to approve a number of amendments to the commission’s budget, Senate Bill 2004, which included a new provision requiring the commission to dismiss ethics complaints older than 180 days. If the bill is signed into law, it would take effect immediately.
The change stemmed from some lawmakers’ frustrations with the pace at which the commission processes complaints. Some filings are more than two years old.

There are 28 complaints that will be more than 180 days old on May 1 — 17 of which are against state lawmakers, Binstock said. 
Rep. Mike Nathe, who brought the amendments, has said the changes would give the commission a tool to reduce its number of pending complaints, some of which are more than two years old. He called the backlog a due process concern that is unfair to those accused of violations, including some of his colleagues in the Legislature.
Commissioners took issue with the notion that the deadline would help them.
“That’s not a tool,” said Commission Chair Dave Anderson. “Giving an arbitrary restriction is not a tool.”
Anderson also said that the Legislature should give the commission more resources if it wants the board to process complaints more quickly. The commission is following the procedures prescribed by the law, he said.
“We have things that have to be accomplished according to statute the Legislature approved,” Anderson said. “So we can’t just hurry things up.”
Nathe said previously that the intent of the bill is to have the 180-day clock start ticking against complaints as soon as the law goes into effect. Under that interpretation, the Ethics Commission would still have half a year to investigate those 28 complaints.
According to Binstock, the language of the bill is not completely clear, and the deadline may work differently in practice.
Commissioners worry the deadline will prevent the commission from meaningfully investigating complaints.
“You could have people who had a complaint filed against them stall in giving you information, which would take you past the 180 days, and so then it would be dismissed,” Commissioner Ward Koeser said.
If the deadline forces the commission to dismiss a complaint before an investigation is completed, the commission’s efforts would go to waste, Binstock said.
“By following the arbitrarily imposed deadline, really what we could have is we could have quite a bit of work, quite a bit of resources put into something and then end up having nothing as a product because we just have to close it,” she said. “I don’t personally think this is a tool for North Dakota citizens.”
Senate narrowly approves adding position to North Dakota Ethics Commission

Commissioner Ron Goodman wondered whether the bill conflicts with the North Dakota Constitution, which states that the Legislature may not do anything that impedes the responsibilities assigned to the Ethics Commission under Article XIV.
“It seems to me that that’s going to be a question that maybe the Supreme Court has to answer,” Goodman said.
The budget also includes a policy provision that Nathe said would help the commission throw out complaints that are unlikely to go anywhere but that the board does not have the ability to dismiss under current law.
The bill will go to a conference committee of representatives and senators, who will work out final changes to the bill.
The Senate approved a budget that included funding for a new staff member dedicated to education and communications, though that position was slashed by the House.
The commission’s main priority for the conference committee will be urging lawmakers to add that funding back in. It also hopes to convince legislators to take policy provisions out of the budget, Binstock said.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Across Colorado, leaders of faith communities across the religious spectrum have signed onto a statement called “Truths About Immigration.” As a faith leader who serves at the First Baptist Church of Denver, I have signed in support of this statement not only because of what I know to be true about the message of my own Christian faith regarding immigrants — that they, we, are to be welcomed, cared for and loved — but also because of what I see from the office of that very church.
Located directly across the street from the state Capitol, our building brings in more people Monday to Saturday than it does on a Sunday. The primary clientele that enter the building are, in fact, immigrants. These immigrants are not looking for places to hide, nor are they looking for a handout, nor are they looking for even a place to necessarily say a prayer.
Rather, they’re looking for a place that can help them fulfill their dreams.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Dreams, for example, of serving as an interpreter for the medical field for individuals who cannot speak a word of English yet require the same medical care that each of us does. Dreams of entering the United States legally, through the assistance of an immigration attorney. Dreams of starting a small business selling coffee on a street corner. Dreams of learning how to dance like their Colombian ancestors in order to keep their culture alive.
The First Baptist Church of Denver houses and partners with organizations that can provide these dreams. Together with Spring Institute, Elevation Law, Coffee Time LLC, and the Latino Arts and Cultural Institute, our building is more than just a church, it is a place that walks alongside each individual to help them accomplish and reach their goals and dreams.
Today, because of the seemingly indiscriminate actions of immigration enforcement, those dreams are on pause, because the people that were scheduled to receive these services are afraid to do so. Similarly, the people that were to provide those services — often immigrants themselves — are afraid to provide them. Our church doors are locked, and entering the building requires identification and a reason — the opposite of how a church should be.
In the midst of an immigration process — or lack thereof — that is limited, complex, backlogged, and expensive, immigrants often turn to community resources such as churches to be able to accomplish their dreams. Even when those dreams are to immigrate to this country legally, immigrants are unable to achieve such a dream just because they are afraid to enter a church.
I call on our national government to treat each human being with dignity and respect, and to allow for the due process that is a right given to each human being to be carried out. These rights are universal and do not adhere to borders or geopolitical relationships. These rights are inherent and inalienable. These rights are for each of us. These rights allow for a more just world and allow for an immigration process that is fair, efficient and effective. These rights are what solidify my faith and what grant us each life.
I plead to you, our federal government: Please, let us as faith communities carry out the work we have been called to do, because it has been proven that you cannot do it with care or compassion.

(Image credit: Heirloom Carbon Technology)As projects to store carbon underground in Louisiana await permit approval to begin putting shovels in the ground, state lawmakers are mulling over whether to allow locals to have more of a say on whether such developments should be given the green light.
Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a complicated issue in Louisiana when it comes to the politics and industry surrounding it. CCS has mixed support across the political spectrum. Some believe it is a worthwhile attempt to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel and industrial production. Others believe the technology is too untested and just a way for the oil and gas industry to justify high levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
As of now, dozens of applications for Class VI well permits, the ones needed to inject carbon dioxide underground, are under technical review at the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources. In a hearing earlier this year, DENR Secretary Tyler Gray said the first Class VI permits should be awarded in the first half of 2025. 
Meanwhile, lawmakers have filed several bills to allow parishes to determine whether they would allow these wells to go forward.

DENR already has strict permitting processes that require research into the geology of the land where injection sites are planned. With the federal government giving Louisiana authority to issue its own Class VI permits, the state is poised to be one of the first to do work in the emerging carbon sequestration industry. 
Some legislators have expressed frustration with how long the state is taking to award these permits out of fear that the projects may get pulled and put into surrounding states that also have the federal government’s permission to regulate Class VI wells.
One of the major fights of the session is anticipated to be over local control of CCS projects. House Bill 4 by state Rep. Chuck Owen, R-Rosepine, lets parishes approve ordinances to prohibit Class VI wells. Local governments can later hold elections to allow CCS projects to move forward should the majority of the parish’s voters approve the project. 
Several other bills allow parishes to carve out prohibitions to Class VI wells or give locals the ability to weigh in on their approval.
Rep. Danny McCormick, R-Oil City, has a bill that goes so far as to make CCS illegal. He did suggest he would be willing to amend the bill but is firm in protecting property owners’ rights over their land. Public meetings in Vernon Parish drew hundreds of people against the projects, he said.
“I don’t believe anybody should have carbon sequestration under their property that [sic] don’t want it,” McCormick said.
McCormick, who does not have any proposed wells in his district, said he is passionate about the issue of private landowners who may not want these wells on or near their land. 
Class VI wells are currently proposed in Allen, Ascension, Assumption, Beauregard, Caldwell, Cameron, Calcasieu, Iberville, Livingston, Pointe Coupee, Rapids, Sabine, St. Helena, St. John the Baptist, St. Charles, Vermillion, Vernon and West Baton Rouge parishes. 
Senate Bill36, by Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, calls for local governments to hold public meetings and accept feedback when carbon capture projects are proposed. The proposal could be amended to add buffer zones around CCS wells and other safety precautions.
Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, said the Class VI permitting process already includes public comment and local officials as part of the process.
“I see these positive economic impacts that are being seen from the Meta deal, the Hyundai deal, the CF Industries deal, all of those are going to depend upon CCS in different parts of the state,” Faucheux said.
There are some concerns from legislators in support of CCS when it comes to allowing certain parishes to ban Class VI wells. Some of the projects will require pipelines to send carbon from other parishes and even other states to a storage site. 
Rep. Brett Geymann’s proposal, House Bill 601, could stymie such pipelines. He said he is in favor of the CCS industry but wants to protect private property ownership rights.
“If the landowner doesn’t want your pipeline through their property, you have to go around them,” Geymann said.
Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, said he will object to some of the local carve outs that he believes will block interstate and intrastate commerce. The state could lose out on businesses that don’t want to have to navigate complicated restrictions.
Faucheux said taking away eminent domain – the right for the government to take private property for public use or development – for CO2 pipelines is a bad idea.
“When you look at the nature of the pipeline network, Louisiana is one of the most mature pipeline networks in any state in the country,” he said. “We’ve been able to build out that network, and CO2 is a part of that, by companies interacting directly with landowners, and the use of eminent domain is more of the exception.”
There are several bills aimed at creating safety protocols and avenues for financial support for anyone potentially damaged by CO2 wells and pipelines. Consumer protection and environmental advocates believe there needs to be rules in place should the worst-case scenario occur, and to make sure the industry knows how to manage CCS projects.
The House Natural Resources Committee anticipates hearing a large number of the local CCS-related bills at the end of April.

He also justified his lawsuit against an eastern Washington county over alleged violations of that law. The letter to the House Judiciary Committee underscores Washington’s place near the center of Republicans’ crusade against so-called “sanctuary” immigration policies, like the one enshrined in the Keep Washington Working Act passed in 2019. 
First-term Republican U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner, of eastern Washington, is among those in Congress applying scrutiny to the state law. 
“Washington’s sanctuary policies are putting the safety of its residents at risk by prioritizing criminal aliens over law-abiding citizens,” Baumgartner said in a recent statement. “It’s time for Washington to rethink these dangerous policies and put its communities first.”
Brown said that instead of pressuring his office, Judiciary Committee members should turn their oversight toward the “draconian tactics and disturbing statements” of the Trump administration. 
“Our country was founded on the promise of equal justice under law,” Brown wrote. “In America, people should not be afraid of their government.”
Brown’s missive came in response to a letter from three Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee: Chairman Jim Jordan, of Ohio, Rep. Tom McClintock, of California, and Baumgartner.
“The state of Washington not only actively thwarts federal immigration enforcement, but it also targets local law enforcement officials for complying with federal law,” they wrote late last month. “Although you claim to serve the people of Washington, your office appears to prioritize the needs of criminal illegal aliens over Washingtonians.”
Brown called these claims “plainly wrong.”
The state law “reflects our Legislature’s judgment that local police should not use their time or resources to assist in immigration enforcement, unless federal law expressly requires it, or in situations where public safety is directly implicated. Contrary to the Committee’s claims, the law does not interfere with federal immigration law,” he retorted.
The law stops local police from helping federal authorities with immigration enforcement. For example, police can’t provide nonpublic personal information to federal authorities investigating civil immigration cases, and can’t interview or detain people solely based on questions about their immigration status. 
Police also aren’t allowed to ask about their immigration status except in rare cases.
“In Washington,” Brown wrote, “we know the community is not well served when people become frightened to report crime or to cooperate as witnesses because they fear that they or a family member may be deported if they contact the police.”
President Donald Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding from cities and states with similar statutes that refuse to aid in his vision of a mass deportation campaign. His Department of Justice has sued Illinois and New York over their sanctuary policies.
Some local governments, including the city of Seattle, have shot back with litigation of their own over the funding threats.
Last month, the attorney general’s office accused the Adams County Sheriff’s Office of aiding federal immigration agents for years, by unlawfully jailing people based solely on immigration status, enabling federal immigration agents to question those in custody and sharing personal information on hundreds of Washingtonians with federal officials.
Baumgartner’s district includes part of Adams County, home to about 20,000 residents.
Brown appeared confused why Congress would be so interested in his lawsuit against the county, which has retained lawyers from a law firm founded by top Trump aide Stephen Miller.
“It is unclear how a single lawsuit, filed in state court, alleging a violation of state law, is of such national prominence as to fall within the Committee’s federal investigative jurisdiction,” he wrote. “But we take seriously the role of Congress to provide effective oversight on behalf of the American people.”
The trio of congressmen asked for documentation of investigations into local law enforcement in Washington for their cooperation with immigration officials, as well as the number of declined federal requests to continue to detain people beyond their release date so immigration officers can take custody.
They also requested the cost of the investigation into the Adams County Sheriff’s Office.
Brown either declined to produce the documents because they were privileged or his office didn’t have them. He also said the cost of the Adams County investigation “is not readily available,” adding that the litigation is paid for via settlements and penalties the attorney general’s office won in court cases last year.
Adams County Sheriff Dale Wagner testified before Congress last week, with an introduction from Baumgartner. 
“This lawsuit is not about justice or protecting communities,” Wagner said. “It’s about enforcing a political agenda that restricts law enforcement’s ability to cooperate with federal authorities.”
And in an interview with The New York Times, the sheriff said he was within his authority to provide information about inmates to federal authorities.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Steve Sinisi of Old Crow Ranch in Durham was among dozens of farmers who paraded through the streets of Augusta on Wednesday on tractors bearing signs like “Support Farmers, Not Billionaires” and “Compost Trump.”
The more than 100 farmers and supporters were there to protest the millions of dollars in federal cuts to agricultural grants and programs and raise awareness about the impacts they would have on their farms and livelihoods.
On a sunny spring day, Sinisi said he should instead have been working on the farm, which raises pasture-grazed beef, pork and chicken.
“It’s a great time to get to work but the fact that we left our farms and came here today says something,” he said. “Unpredictability in agriculture: it does not work that way.”
Sinisi said he invested about $35,000 into a solar project to make his farm more sustainable after signing contracts with the U.S. Department of Agriculture last year. Now, the future of that contract and his reimbursement are in doubt.  
Farmers across the state and country are living with the same uncertainty after the USDA cut several programs that have provided millions of dollars and critical support to Maine farms.

Among the sources of funding under threat is the Natural Resource Conservation Service’s Environmental Quality Incentives Program, a cost-share program that helps integrate conservation practices into working lands. It is funded through two sources, the Farm Bill and the Inflation Reduction Act, the latter of which the Trump administration has tried to freeze.
“Our farms here in Maine who produce the actual food we eat are going to be left high and dry if we don’t get these USDA programs reinstated,” said Sarah Alexander, executive director of the Maine Organic Farmers and Growers Association. 
This week, USDA also ended the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program, which has provided over $477 million to help Maine farms subsidize projects focused on integrating climate-smart agriculture and forestry practices. 
In the announcement, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said the program “was largely built to advance the green new scam at the benefit of NGOs, not American farmers,” and said “select projects may continue if it is demonstrated that a significant amount of the federal funds awarded will go to farmers.”
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, who owns an organic farm on North Haven, marched alongside the protesters to the State House, holding a sign that read, “Support Maine farms.” 
Addressing the crowd after, she thanked those who showed up and assured them she was advocating for farmers whose contracts had been abruptly terminated. Pingree said she routinely submits a list of all federal cuts to the chair of the House Agriculture Committee, on which she serves, and said she will continue to do so until the money returns to Maine.
She criticized recent USDA staff reductions, noting that many of the laid-off workers had provided crucial technical support to Maine farmers.
“Really, what is wrong with the USDA?” she asked. “What is wrong with this administration to say they believe in farmers — yet they are breaking these contracts?”
 “People need to understand exactly what’s going on. Being here, talking to your friends and neighbors, is making a difference.”
Small farms are the target of these cuts, said Michael Levine who owns Avalon Acres in Hollis. He was expecting to receive $2,500 through the Climate-Smart program before it got cut, which would have been used for compost and organic supplements.
Last August, he got certified through USDA as an organic producer. However, he said that had he known a USDA cost share program that helps farmers obtain supplies would also be at risk, he would never have paid the fees to get certified. 
Avalon Acres had been expecting $750 through the cost share program, which he said “would not have been a small amount for us.”
Levine said he was also exploring partnerships with his local school district to provide local produce for school meals. However, earlier this year, USDA canceled the Local Food Purchasing Assistance program that would have provided $1.25 million to Maine over the next three years for food banks to source fresh food from local producers.
“The uncertainty rippling through our food system is real,” said Maine Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland), who owns Broadturn Farm in Scarborough and serves as president of Maine Farmland Trust.
“Programs that farmers and communities count on are at risk, and we know the burden lands on those who are already doing the hardest work.”

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) gives top marks to the expert staff of Rhode Island’s coastal regulatory agency in a new evaluation. But federal regulators remain concerned over three open seats on the politically appointed Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC), calling on Gov. Dan McKee and the legislature to fill the vacancies “as soon as possible.”
“It is essential that a quorum is maintained and the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program conducts a regular and full schedule of Council and subcommittee meetings in order to implement Rhode Island’s approved coastal management program,” NOAA’s Office of Coastal Management wrote in its April 10 report.
The 148-page document examined federal data collection, in-person meetings with staff and council members, and verbal and written public comments on the agency’s performance spanning the five-year period from September 2019 to October 2024. Federal monitoring of the state coastal program is required as part of a 1972 federal law setting up coastal regulations and funding for state-level programs. 
More than one-third of CRMC’s $6.2 million budget in fiscal 2025 came from federal funds, including roughly $1.7 million from NOAA. 
NOAA’s latest evaluation concludes that the state is “successfully implementing and enforcing” its federal coastal management program based on examination of its program administration, offshore wind projects, public access and protections against shoreline erosion.
However, NOAA highlighted several weaknesses in Rhode Island’s adherence to federal regulations, including the vacancies on the 10-member council. Seven spots are filled, with the newest gubernatorial appointee, Dr. Michael Reuter of Barrington, confirmed by the Rhode Island Senate last month. The three open seats risk canceled meetings and delayed decisions if the council can’t get at least six of its sitting members to show up — a problem that has plagued the appointed body for years.
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in an email Wednesday that the governor was seeking qualified candidates for the open seats. She confirmed candidates are now under consideration, but did not respond to follow-up questions such as how many contenders are being vetted.

A chorus calls out for reform 
Council vacancies are one of many problems cited by critics, whose frustrations with the panel’s controversial, and at times, unlawful, decisions have reached a boiling point. Coastal advocates have teamed up with Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and state lawmakers to overhaul the agency, proposing to eliminate the council and reshape the CRMC as an administrative body akin to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. Several versions of this proposal have been introduced in the Rhode Island General Assembly this year, but not advanced beyond committee prior to the legislature’s April break.
NOAA took no position on the pending state legislation but noted states have flexibility to determine the structure of their coastal management programs. Of the 29 states with federal coastal management programs, only three — Rhode Island, California and North Carolina —  give significant decision-making power to an appointed panel, according to a February report from the Rhode Island Department of Administration. 
Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, saw NOAA’s indifference to how Rhode Island executes its coastal management program in a positive light. Save the Bay is a leading advocate for the proposed overhaul of the CRMC.
“Sometimes, opponents [of the reform bill] will point to NOAA as this sort of bogeyman,” Thorp said in an interview Wednesday. “NOAA is basically saying, ‘we don’t care how you set it up. You have a menu of options available to you.’”
Save the Bay ultimately wants to get rid of the council, but Thorp still wants the open seats filled in the interim.
“We need the council to be fully seated so they can function and conduct their business,” Thorp said.
The CRMC issued a statement on April 10 celebrating its “good grade” from NOAA. Jeffrey Willis, CRMC executive director, acknowledged requests for an interview but did not respond to subsequent calls and emails.
60 to 80-hour weeks
The report offered high praise for the agency’s 32-person staff who “excel at defining their role as regulator and policymaker, forging strong partnerships with others who have complementary skill sets and missions.”
However, the increasing scope of their work and responsibilities, from the slew of proposed offshore wind projects to disputes over public access to the shoreline and complex permitting applications, are more than the current employee roster can handle. Employees worked 60 to 80-hour weeks during reviews of proposed offshore wind projects, according to the report. 
“Moving forward, a continued insufficient staffing level and strain felt by staff places the state of Rhode Island at a disadvantage in being asked to manage and analyze a significant amount of information and material required to complete additional federal consistency reviews,” the report stated.
Lack of staffing has also contributed to a backlog of permitting applications, insufficient enforcement against violators such as Quidnessett Country Club, and delayed and incomplete reporting required for federal grants, the report stated. 
McKee has rejected calls to fund new hires for the strapped coastal agency. His proposed fiscal 2026 budget rejects the CRMC’s request for money for five more employees. 
In lieu of more full-time workers, NOAA suggested partnerships with university law programs and use of third-party contractors. And it reiterated a requirement first made in a 2020 report to transition to an online permitting database. The original 2024 deadline has now been extended to Sept. 30, 2026.
The CRMC did not respond to questions Wednesday regarding the delays in creating the online database.
The evaluation comes as the Trump administration has imposed major layoffs and budget cuts at NOAA. How attempts to gut the federal regulatory agency will trickle down to Rhode Island’s state coastal program remains murky, though Willis told council members during an April 8 meeting that the CRMC could lose up to 10% of its $1.7 million in NOAA funding. When incorporating additional administrative costs for the state to seek and carry out federal funding, the cuts could rise to 17%, Willis said.
“At this time of year, we usually have our federal allocation in hand,” Willis said. “Right now, we don’t know how we’re going to put it in our budget and we don’t know what kind of funding we’re going to get. We’re just in a wait-and-see period.”

American Rivers has named the Gauley River No. 10 on its list of most endangered rivers. (Getty Images)West Virginia’s Gauley River has been named to a conservation organization’s list of the most endangered rivers in the country this year. 
The river is 10th on the list of  America’s Most Endangered Rivers for 2025. The river is threatened by coal mining pollution in one of its tributaries, the Cherry River, according to the organization. 
Each year, American Rivers sets the list of rivers that face a major decision that the public can influence. The list is based on the significance of the river to people and wildlife, and the magnitude of the threat. 
The West Virginia Highlands Conservancy and Appalachian Voices is suing the South Fork Coal Company, which operates more than 3,000 acres of surface mines in Greenbrier and Pocahontas counties outside the Monongahela National Forest, over alleged violations of the Clean Water Act and Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. 
The mines have violated water pollution standards at least 80 documented times since 2019, releasing sediment and toxic heavy metals into the river, according to a news release.
The groups have challenged the U.S. Forest Service decision to grant the company access to use a national forest road as a haul road without complying with environmental protection laws. The company was first granted access to the road in 2013 based on an application that falsely claimed it did not cross into the forest, said Olivia Miller, program director for the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy. The access was renewed in 2018 and 2023. 
The company has been permitted to operate the Rocky Run Surface Mine, the mine at the center of the lawsuits over pollution, since 2021.
The road was temporarily shut down, but reopened after the company appealed to the Department of Interior, Miller said. 
The environmental groups’ lawsuits have been stayed after the coal company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in February. 
“We’re waiting to see what happens with the bankruptcy proceedings. So this could be tied up in court for years, and meanwhile, they are still hauling coal,” Miller said. 
The Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and and Enforcement (OSMRE) has a public comment period underway now about the coal company’s request for a valid existing rights determination to continue using the road. Mining activity in the national forest is prohibited, exempt for a few exemptions.
“For four years, this company has illegally operated within the Monongahela National Forest,” Willie Dodson, coal impacts program manager at Appalachian Voices said in a news release. “Now, having just declared bankruptcy, South Fork Coal is asking regulators to retroactively validate this activity. It’s unacceptable. If they get away with it, I shudder to think what the next encroachment by the coal industry into our public land will be. Are they going to strip Spruce Knob? Are they going to put a sludge dam at Cranberry Glades? This is the time to draw a line in the sand.”
Miller said the river being added to the endangered list will help alert policy makers and the public of the river’s plight. 
“The Gauley’s listing specifically will hopefully draw national attention to ongoing problems that we’re seeing with this company and encourage the public and policymakers to step up before any more irreversible harm occurs in this sensitive area,” Miller said. 
“We are asking OSMRE to deny the after-the-fact request that the company can continue using this road,” Miller said. “So right now, we need as much public comment as possible to pressure the OSMRE to deny their valid existing rights request.”
A representative of South Fork Coal Company could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The Gauley River draws tens of thousands of white water rafters each year for its world class rapids. The river and its tributaries are also popular fishing destinations. Miller said pollution puts the river’s recreation opportunities at risk.
“The outcome of this valid existing rights determination will reverberate far beyond West Virginia, and I think will really set a precedent for better or for worse on mining and public lands,” Miller said. “And I really don’t believe that the people of West Virginia want to see the Monongahela National Forest impacted or mined. As somebody who grew up in the Mon in Tucker County, that would be just completely devastating and earth shattering for me to see happen in my lifetime. 
“So now is the time for people to come together and protect our outdoor recreation economy and activities like rafting, fishing and hiking, hunting that people from West Virginia love, and these are activities that thrive on clean, healthy ecosystems,” Miller said. 
The Gauley River listing comes days after President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders meant to bolster the nation’s struggling coal industry. The orders allow some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to keep operating and directs federal agencies to lift barriers to coal mining and prioritize coal leasing on U.S. lands.
“Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels,” Miller said. “Even though most of our state leaders would like to ignore climate change, we cannot ignore it any longer and this push to ‘bring back coal’ is only going to cause more pain and suffering for people in West Virginia and across the world,” she said. “And I think the recent executive orders really exemplifies the tension between efforts to bolster domestic coal production again and the need to protect public lands and water resources.”

Kevin West, R-Moore, is the House author of a bill that would limit the governor’s ability to close businesses during a pandemic. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A bill headed to the House floor that limits the governor’s ability to close businesses during a pandemic is “irresponsible” and puts Oklahomans’ safety at risk, one lawmaker said. 
Supporters of the bill said businesses need additional protections because closures during the COVID-19 pandemic were in violation of the Oklahoma Constitution and were “very random.”
Senate Bill 672, authored by Sen. Julie McIntosh, R-Porter, and Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, would require Oklahoma governors to have scientific evidence that the “nature of a particular business” directly contributes to spreading disease before closing businesses during a declared pandemic. The governor would also need to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing to “nonessential” businesses before issuing an executive order that closes businesses. 
Rep. Meloyde Blancett, D-Tulsa, criticized the measure Wednesday. She said at the beginning of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic no one knew how the virus spread, and without a “handle on what makes us safe, it’s irresponsible to put laws in place like this.”
While she said she has a private sector and business background and wants to see businesses survive during a pandemic, Blancett said the bill has too many “open questions” and the hearing process could be extensive. 
“It was a pandemic, not an epidemic, not a bad outbreak, a pandemic,” Blancett said. “Meaning the danger of imminent death for those that are vulnerable is clear and present, and what Rep. West’s bill unfortunately does is it puts businesses at a higher level of care than it does the health of our citizens.”
During the most recent pandemic, Oklahoma had over 1.2 million reported cases of COVID-19 and nearly 18,000 deaths, according to John Hopkins, which compiled the state’s statistics. 
The number of deaths was “not insignificant,” said Blancett, who voted against advancing the bill out of committee Tuesday. 
Blancett said Tulsa should not be told what to do in a pandemic based on the experiences of Moore, West’s hometown. 
“And at the end of the day, at some point in time we have to trust the people that we’ve elected to represent us,” she said. 
West, R-Moore, said his hometown let individuals and businesses make their own decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was “not a superspreader community.”
When asked about how evidence would be gathered and hearings could reasonably be held without creating an additional burden on businesses or the governor during a pandemic, West said Wednesday that he expects that impact to be “very limited.”
“I don’t see it being something that overwhelms the Governor’s Office,” he said. “But before the governor could even do that, they would have to have the scientific evidence … (that) businesses like this are a contributing factor to the spread.”
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Kevin Stitt declared a state of emergency March 15, 2020 and issued an executive order nine days later requiring the closure of various businesses. Businesses in Oklahoma were quickly reopened under Stitt. Under the Open Up and Recover Safely plan, the first reopening phase began April 24, 2020 and the state was “fully reopened” by June 1, 2020. 
Stitt’s closure orders faced legal challenges to allow businesses, like bars, to remain open. West said he thinks this bill could eliminate the need for these legal challenges by prompting conversations surrounding business closures, but recourse through the court system would still be an option.
West said he has not heard from Stitt’s office on this legislation yet. 
A spokesperson for Stitt did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication. 
McIntosh, the Senate author, said Wednesday that the closure of businesses during the pandemic was a violation of the Oklahoma Constitution. 
The bill language references part of the Oklahoma Constitution, specifically that “all persons have the inherent right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the enjoyment of the gains of their own industry.”
She introduced the bill because as a physician she saw how people were affected when businesses were declared “nonessential.” She said people ended up with mental health issues and loss of purpose. 
“During COVID, it was very random what different states closed and it made no sense,” McIntosh said. “So it was OK if you went to the liquor store or the bar, but you couldn’t get your hair cut. And there was no scientific data to show that one (business) spreads the disease worse than the other.”
The bill cleared the House Commerce and Economic Development Oversight Committee on a 14-3 vote. If the House passes the measure without any changes, it heads to the governor’s desk.

(Mark Gocke/Courtesy)A dismayed Chris Servheen is raising the alarm about what’s become of federal scientists who have kept watch over the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly bear population for the last 55 years.
The group of research biologists and technicians, known as the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, are being hamstrung at best and arguably dismantled, he told WyoFile. For decades, until his retirement in 2016, Sevheen worked closely with the study team while coordinating grizzly bear recovery for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
“It’s functionally destroying the organization,” Servheen said. “The study team has been in place since 1970 — over 50 years of work and experience and knowledge. It’s going to just disappear and die.”

Servheen’s perplexed about what the Trump administration has to gain.
“How could anybody be so negligent and vile that they’re trying to destroy something that has brought grizzly bears back from the edge of extinction?” he said. “Why would you do that? It’s just so destructive.”
Led by Elon Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency’s dismantling started with a hiring freeze. Longtime supervisory wildlife biologist Mark Haroldson retired, and his position is not being filled, according to Servheen. Then, the team’s longtime leader, Frank van Manen, announced an earlier-than-desired retirement.
“He didn’t want to leave,” Servheen said of van Manen, who declined to comment.
According to Servheen, van Manen’s departure was related to the federal government’s ongoing upheaval.
“They’re putting fear into people,” Servheen said. “That’s basically evil, to do that to hard-working people who have been civil servants for decades.”
The Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team is part of the U.S. Geological Survey, and its website lists four other employees. Three are technicians, which are often seasonal, entry-level employees. The remaining staff biologist has been in the job about three years.






If any of the study team’s employees opt to stick it out amid a second wave of buyouts, they’re likely to be out of an office space come fall. The Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, described by its director as “one of the nation’s key laboratories to study the ecosystems and species of the Northern Rockies,” is one of hundreds of federal facilities being shuttered by DOGE.






Although located in Bozeman, many of the federal facility’s researchers do work in Wyoming.
“They do all kinds of other stuff: brucellosis and chronic wasting disease and aquatic species,” Servheen said. “It’s a huge science center.”
The planned closure has elicited protests. According to Yellowstonian.org, 42 retired or active biologists petitioned Montana’s congressional delegation to use their influence to “protect (the science center) and its employees from these unwarranted attacks by DOGE.”
Federal offices located in Wyoming have not escaped the closures. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s tribal-focused Lander conservation office and a USGS Cheyenne water science station are among those that have been marked for the chopping block.
WyoFile could not officially confirm impacts to the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team. Federal agencies under the Trump administration have declined or not responded to WyoFile’s requests for more information on downsizing and office closures. An inquiry to a USGS public affairs officer on Thursday yielded no information about the matter.
The Center for Biological Diversity has been pressing the federal agency for details as well. On Thursday, the environmental advocacy organization publicized a Freedom of Information Act request to gain more insight into the future of the federal grizzly team.
Both recently departed veteran study team members — van Manen and Haroldson — are staying engaged in grizzly science in pro-bono emeritus roles, according to a source familiar with the situation.
Nevertheless, Servheen worries that the hit to the science team could trickle down to the grizzly population — estimated at 1,000 or so bears in the Greater Yellowstone — that it’s charged with studying.
During the decades, federal researchers have played a pivotal role in improving understanding of the region’s bruins, including completing studies that have helped make the case that grizzly bears are fully recovered and no longer require Endangered Species Act protection. They’ve also amassed mortality and other demographic datasets and compiled an annual report.
“The foundation of Yellowstone grizzly bear recovery has been built on science,” Servheen said. “Removing that science eliminates our ability to maintain Yellowstone grizzly bears.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Griz-shaking-Mark-Gockecourtesy-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-16 16:11:40.776134

(File/Getty)A report published Wednesday by the ACLU of Alabama estimated at least 277 people died in Alabama prisons last year.
That number matches the figure provided by the Alabama Department of Corrections and is lower than the 325 deaths tabulated by Alabama Appleseed in 2023, but the number of deaths has yet to meaningfully decline in the past few years despite efforts by the ADOC to secure the population and prevent corrections officers from transporting contraband into the facilities.
“It is high,” said Eddie Burkhalter, a researcher for Alabama Appleseed, a nonprofit that advocates for criminal justice reform.

A message was sent to the Alabama Department of Corrections on Wednesday seeking comment.
The ACLU said in the report that the number is likely higher because the ADOC has failed to maintain accurate records.
“While the raw number was larger (325) in fiscal year 2023, we are not seeing dramatic improvements by any means in Alabama’s prisons,” said Alison Mollman in an interview Wednesday, interim legal director of the ACLU of Alabama.
The report said the largest number of deaths (46) were the result of accidental deaths or overdoses.
The report cites corrections officers as a contributing factor for the number of deaths, particularly the deaths of overdose.
“In 2019, ADOC’s own staff members reported to the DOJ that “without a doubt” the number one way contraband is getting into prisons is by staff smuggling it in,” the report states, adding that the problem remains despite “continued notice of the central role staff play in trafficking drugs into ADOC facilities.”
The overdose number will likely be revised upward because 105 people died in prison whose cause is unknown, or the cases are still under investigation.
“It is really overdoses that are driving these death numbers,” said Burkhalter, who researches prison deaths. “Drugs continue to come in the prisons, largely in part because of officers who bring them in and staff who bring them in.”
Another 77 people died because of natural causes, though the specific causes are not known.
The report estimated that there were at least 36 deaths in Kilby Correctional Facility In Montgomery; 35 deaths at St. Clair Correctional Facility in Saint Clair County; 34 deaths at Limestone Correctional Facility in Limestone County and 26 deaths at Bullock Correctional Facility in Union Springs. The four combined accounted for nearly half of all the deaths (47%) that occurred in 2024.
ACLU also cited racial disparities in the report. While 26% of the population in Alabama is Black, Black Alabamians comprise almost 60% of the state’s prison population and account for an equal number of the deaths that happened in 2024.
“Alabama’s prisons are sites of torture,” said Allison Mollman, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama. “When people are convicted and sentenced to prison, their punishment is to be taken away from their families and communities. But the punishment they experience from the state of Alabama is widespread drug use, constant violence, both at the hands of other prisoners and staff, and widespread misconduct.”
People incarcerated in Alabama’s prisons continue to face deadly and dangerous conditions more than four years after the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit and publicized scathing findings about the conditions in some of the facilities.
A team of researchers from both the state and national ACLU offices compiled data from publicly available sources, including news articles and obituaries, as well as state and federal court records and reports by nonprofits and academic papers.
They also obtained information by filing records requests with government agencies and taking numbers posted on the Corrections Department’s website.
The report recommends improved tracking of deaths and study of the factors leading to them.
“To understand and respond to the problem, we have to understand the breadth of the problem, so it is our position that the first step, and an easy step for DOC to take, is to increase the transparency, the frequency, at which it is giving the public information,” Mollman said.
Other recommendations include updating the categories that indicate the manner of death, require autopsies for every person who dies while in the Department’s custody and provide an annual report on the deaths that happened for the year.
Mollman also said the ADOC needs to change the culture within the department by changing the leadership at the warden level. Current practice is that wardens obtain their post by working up the ranks of the department, starting as corrections officers. Other states have hired people as wardens who come from different backgrounds, such as social workers.
“Punishment is where the Department of Corrections is focused on, keeping people in segregation, locking them down in their cells, keeping them in dorms without air conditioning and without supervision,” Mollman said. “If we can move from a system to focus on rehabilitation truly, that has the programming, has the incentives for incarcerated people to do well, if we have a parole system that responds to that by granting people parole who are doing well in prison, those are the types of things that change culture and improve conditions and reduce levels of violence.”

(Photo by Katie Akin / Iowa Capital Dispatch)A bill to waive university tuition and fees for Iowa law enforcement has moved out of a House subcommittee with support from its members and the public.
House Study Bill 329 would require Iowa community colleges and public universities to waive tuition and fees for “peace officers,” defined in Iowa code as sheriffs, deputies, police officers, certain parole and probation officers, security officers employed by a state university, conservation officers, and qualified employees of the Department of Transportation or an aviation authority. Dependents of peace officers are also eligible for waivers, with certain parameters.
The bill would create a reimbursement fund for the waivers and place it under control of the state’s College Student Aid Commission, with a proposed $10 surcharge added to automatic or remote traffic citations providing the money to fill the fund. The commission would use money allocated to the fund to pay back colleges and universities who have applied the cost of the waivers they provided to students.

To qualify for waivers, officers must be residents of Iowa, have Iowa Law Enforcement Academy certification, meet enrollment requirements for their institution and pursue a degree related to law enforcement, according to the bill. Their dependents must agree to spend at least five years in Iowa after graduation or repay the amount that was waived.
Under the legislation, the waivers would last three years at a community college and five years at a public university.
Lobbyists representing various police associations voiced their appreciation for the legislation and the work lawmakers have put in over the past few years to pass legislation aiding in the areas of “recruitment, retention and retirement,” Iowa Police Chief Association lobbyist Larry Murphy said.
“If you think about … a 30-year career and break it into three decades, that middle piece, somewhere from year seven through 20, this piece is just really critical, because this is where officers would be either tired of the stress or (looking for) other opportunities,” Murphy said. “They’ll look at that opportunity of actually getting college paid for, partially paid for, with their kids going to community colleges or regent universities, (so we’re) very supportive.”
Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jillian Carlson said the board is registered undecided on the bill despite supporting its end goal of helping officers further their education because of how the program would be structured. In order to not put additional burden on the student aid commission, Carlson said the board would rather see the program practice tuition reimbursement or loan repayment rather than providing waivers.
Rep. Carter Nordman, R-Adel, chaired the subcommittee. He said he and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, who was not present at the meeting, would support the legislation. Rep. Kenan Judge filled in for Rep. Eric Gjerde and said while he could not sign his approval of the legislation himself, he would support it if it makes its way to the House floor.
With the subcommittee’s approval, the bill will head to the full Ways and Means committee.
“Anything we can do to support a police officer out there doing the dangerous work they do, I think we should do it,” Judge said.

John Hickenlooper on Tuesday urged the U.S. Supreme Court to start holding Trump administration officials in contempt of court and “lock them up” if they refuse to comply with the court’s unanimous order to “facilitate” the return of a Maryland man wrongly deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.
“The Supreme Court’s got to step up and say, ‘All right, we’re going to start holding people in contempt of court.’ They have the ability to sanction,” Hickenlooper said in an interview with Colorado Newsline. “They can take the people, the officials who deny any culpability or any responsibility, they can bring them in and force them to testify, to come to the court. And if they don’t come, they’re in contempt, and then you lock them up.”
Following a roundtable press event with local officials worried about what massive cuts to the federal workforce will mean for mountain towns surrounded by federally owned forests, Hickenlooper took questions from local and state media.

Hickenlooper was asked about President Donald Trump’s statements on Monday in a joint White House press conference with El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele at which Trump urged Bukele to build more prisons and told him “homegrowns are next” — an apparent reference to U.S. citizens. Bukele reportedly replied, “all right.”
“I did not think he meant citizens. I disagree with you,” Hickenlooper said in Eagle on Tuesday, but he was told by a reporter that Trump repeated the remarks on Fox News, emphasizing he means “homegrown criminals.”
“No, he wants to send U.S. citizens down to …?” Hickenlooper said. “Well, again, if this doesn’t get the Supreme Court in action, I don’t know what will. But obviously at a certain point, and we’re close to that point, the country’s going to rise up because there are certain things …” He didn’t complete the thought.
‘You want me to get my pitch fork?’
A federal judge in Maryland on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to show evidence it has attempted to secure the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to a brutal mega-prison in El Salvador. District Judge Paula Xinis said the current record shows “nothing has been done.”
A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday launched proceedings to determine if Trump administration officials should face criminal contempt charges over the deportations case in his court, and in Colorado on Monday, a federal judge in Denver ordered the Trump administration not to deport any detainees held in Colorado under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.
Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen living in Maryland who is married to a U.S. citizen, has a valid U.S. work permit, and has children who are U.S. citizens, was deported last month with hundreds of others under the legally questionable Alien Enemies Act. Federal authorities have admitted in court that his deportation was a mistake.
“I agree that that’s the most hideous, heinous act I’ve seen, where you can take an innocent person, pick them up for the wrong reason … and they put him in one of the most dangerous, insect- and vermin-infested prisons in the Western Hemisphere,” Hickenlooper, a former Democratic Denver mayor and Colorado governor, said. “That prison in El Salvador is notorious for how dangerous it is. And now they’re saying that they can’t get him out of there. I’m fully aware, and that will not stand. I cannot believe the Supreme Court’s going to allow that to stand.”
A reporter asked Hickenlooper what the U.S. Senate can do about the case.
“You want me to get my pitch fork?” Hickenlooper said. “The Senate, we don’t have a police force. Do you think we have a police force? We already have hearings planned and laid out on this stuff. We’ll shine a bright light on it.”
Hickenlooper said he understands the growing anger in the country directed at both the Republican Party in power for its increasingly unpopular agenda and Democrats, whom some blame for not putting up enough of a fight against administration policies. He said he felt that anger personally at a town hall in Grand Junction Monday, where people were “pretty frustrated and pissed off.”
“It’s going to be a battle. It’s going to be a war,” Hickenlooper said. “And the only real leverage that we have as a Congress in a constitutional democracy is to have people rise up. What I said to the group last night is, ‘You’ve got to organize.’ I said to the group here (in Eagle), ‘You’ve got to organize. You’ve got to demonstrate, you’ve got to march, you have to rise up.’ No senator shows up and says, ‘Hey, come watch me.’ That’s not going to change anything.”
Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has been drawing massive crowds around the country for his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, both last month in Denver and more recently in deep-red Idaho.

(Courtesy of Dr. Priya Bansal)Patients in five states who have severe asthma and are covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield are facing a new obstacle to getting treatment.
On Tuesday, BCBS began mandating that severe asthma patients self-administer their drugs at home, unless their provider gets prior approval from the insurance company.
The patients affected are those covered in Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Montana, but not those with Medicare or Medicaid, the insurance giant says. Those five states are included in a combined BCBS plan which is owned by Health Care Service Corporation.
In a statement, the corporation said the change is “being made with the interests of our members in mind — promoting access to treatment that is convenient and effective.”
Given as injections, the treatments in question are Fasenra (benralizumab), Tezspire (tezepelumab), Nucala (mepolizumab) and Xolair (omalizumab). All belong to a class of drugs known as biologics.
The decision is expected to affect thousands of patients. It’s estimated that between 5% and 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, characterized by more flare-ups and hospitalizations. In Illinois, for example, about 860,000 patients have asthma, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means between 43,000 and 86,000 of them have severe asthma.
Clinics already have loads of prior authorizations to process that often delay care, said Dr. Priya Bansal, a pediatrician and asthma and allergy physician in Illinois. Her practice sees many rural patients and those with chronic disease.
“On any given day, we’ll have anywhere from 30, to my highest was 130,” she said.
The change interferes with a provider and patient decision on whether in-office or at-home treatment is best for the patient, Bansal said.
“That decision that’s supposed to go on between the physician and the patient is getting taken away,” she said. “If I have a pediatric food allergy patient and they want to get the medication in the clinic, I want to be able to have the flexibility to do that.”
States try to rein in health insurers’ claim denials, with mixed results

The sickest asthma patients are often on biologics, explained Dr. Bridgette Jones, past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ drug committee and the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology’s asthma cough diagnosis and treatment panel.
“These are the patients that have failed at other therapies,” said Jones, a pediatric allergy and immunology physician at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Missouri. “Once you’re getting to a biologic, it means that your asthma is not under control, having frequent flare-ups.”
Black and Indigenous adults and children, as well as Puerto Rican people have higher rates of illness and less access to care.
For people who suffer from severe asthma, the typical inhaler is often not enough. The affected drugs can help manage severe, uncontrolled asthma by reducing airway inflammation,
While the drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for self-injecting at home, they also come with risks for the uncommon but life-threatening anaphylaxis. That’s why providers typically start patients on these drugs in-office for monitoring. But for at least one of the drugs, Xolair, the reaction can also happen up to a year into treatment.
Many families are not comfortable administering biologics to their kids with severe asthma, Jones said. Clinics serving higher-need or underserved populations may often lack the resources to deal with more prior approvals, she added.
A recent study by Massachusetts General Hospital and funded by Amgen, which developed Tezspire with AstraZeneca, suggested that in some states, the percentage of asthma patients with severe asthma is higher than 10%. In Texas, for example, about 23% of severe persistent asthma had severe uncontrolled disease.
This story has been updated with a statement from Health Care Service Corporation and to clarify why the change only affects patients in five states.

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Legislation seeks to stop South Carolina school districts from requiring teachers to give students grades they didn’t earn.
Proposals filed earlier this month stem from a freshman senator’s quarrel with the school board he sat on before his election to the Statehouse. What started out as Sen. Jeff Zell’s attempt to block Sumter County from resurrecting a practice he fought to end could undo policies that have spread statewide over the last decade.
Measures filed April 3 in the House and Senate ban policies — whether district-wide or at individual schools — that set a minimum grade for teachers to give students, regardless of what they earned. Such policies would put school districts at risk of losing 10% of their state aid.
As a school board member, Zell helped undo a directive that barred teachers from giving students a grade of less than 50 on report cards for the first three quarters. That’s 10 points below a passing grade in South Carolina, where a D starts at 60.
Even Zell’s not sure exactly how long Sumter County’s grading floor existed. It had been in the district’s grading manual for teachers for at least a decade but was not a board decision — until the vote last August to revoke it.
Zell fought it as allowing students to do little-to-no school work for the first three quarters but still get passed on to the next grade if they applied themselves and did well in the final quarter.
“It’s just fundamentally not right,” the Sumter Republican told the SC Daily Gazette, adding, “I’ve yet to hear a single shred of evidence that it’s helpful.”
When the newly elected school board, without Zell, considered bringing back the grading floor as an approved board policy, he filed the legislation. Rep. Fawn Pedalino of Turbeville, whose district includes part of Sumter County, filed a companion bill in the House.
Zell noted the legislation specifies that students can still do extra work to replace or otherwise recover from a bad grade.
“Second chances matter to me,” but they should be provided in a way that doesn’t “incentivize lackadaisical effort,” he said.
SC students skip school a lot. The problem helps explain their dismal test scores, report finds.

On April 7, four days after the bills were introduced, the Sumter County school board rejected the proposal with a 4-4 tie vote.
But Zell and Pedalino aren’t dropping the matter.
Pedalino, who lives in Clarendon County, said the idea shouldn’t be acceptable anywhere in the state.
“We need to make sure we set these kids up for success,” she said.
Republican leaders joining them as co-sponsors include House Speaker Murrell Smith of Sumter and Senate Education Chairman Greg Hembree of Little River, though the school district he represents, Horry County, does not have any such policy.
“Teachers can and do issue a grade lower than a 50,” Lisa Bourcier, a spokeswoman for the state’s third-largest district, told the Gazette.
Districts’ reasoning
It’s unclear how many school districts in South Carolina have similar grading floors.
That’s not something tracked by the state Department of Education. Those are local decisions, an agency spokesman said.
But the topic has been increasingly debated around the state over the last decade, said Patrick Kelly, a high school teacher who works for the Palmetto State Teachers Association.
And, while teachers understand the theory behind a grading floor, the “negatives outweigh the positives,” he said.
Shawn Ragin, chairman of the Sumter County school board, countered that setting a minimum grade such as 50 is a “strategic academic intervention, not a loophole or grade inflation tactic.
“Their purpose is to ensure students are not academically doomed by a single failure, encouraging re-engagement rather than academic withdrawal,” he wrote in a statement to the Gazette explaining his opposition to the legislation.
A 50 is still a failing grade, he noted. But assigning a grade of no less than 50 — he said “it’s not about ‘giving’ points” — ensures a student can still recover. It’s mathematically impossible to pass “after one or two zeroes,” he wrote.
Ragin, who’s also headmaster of a local private preschool, pointed to five other districts in South Carolina with similar grading floors, saying they “adopted the policy after seeing that giving a zero for missing work disproportionately harmed students in poverty, with disabilities, or experiencing trauma.”
The Gazette reached out to all five districts he cited.
In Kershaw County, which adjoins Sumter, it’s not an actual policy. However, teachers don’t give a grade of less than 50 on any report card for high schoolers. Younger students can’t get less than a 50 for the first three quarters. Parents are informed by a written note that their child’s actual grade is lower, said district spokesperson Becky Bean.
She did not say how teachers know not to give a lower grade if it’s not policy.
Fewer SC graduates went to college this fall, state report card shows

In Richland One, the district for schools in the state’s capital city, students of all grade levels can’t get less than a 50 on any of their four report cards.
The goal is to ensure “temporary setbacks do not irreparably hinder a student’s academic progress,” said district spokesperson Ilyssa Weiner.
Without the policy, she said, it’s realistic that a student facing personal challenges could earn a 25 for the first quarter. But earning a 70 — a C in South Carolina — in the next three quarters would still average 59 for the year, which is just barely failing.
Greenville County, the state’s largest district, also has a different policy for middle schoolers and high schoolers.
In high school, students can’t get less than a 50 on any report card. In middle school, they can’t get less than a 50 on any assignment. That’s because it’s more difficult to keep middle schoolers engaged, said Tim Waller, the district’s longtime spokesman.
Ending that policy could result in a “decrease in student morale and a wider achievement gap between students who have support systems and those who do not,” Waller said.
The Gazette did not get a response from messages left with spokespeople in Charleston County or Richland Two in suburban Columbia, where it’s spring break.
Teachers’ opposition
Teachers in those districts oppose the policies.
They “lessen the integrity of a diploma,” said Sherry East, a teacher in Rock Hill and president of the South Carolina Education Association.
She happened to be meeting last week with a group of teachers from Sumter County when the grading floor came up in the conversation. All of them told her they’re adamantly against the policy, she said.
Teachers want to help students but don’t want to be forced to give students a grade they haven’t earned, she said.
She agreed with Zell’s second-chance argument: “Let me let the kid do some extra work or some extra credit if I think the situation merits it,” she said.
Sumter County school district’s own survey found that more than 8 of every 10 teachers opposed the 50% grading floor, The Sumter Item reported last May, before the school board voted to revoke the practice.
Teachers who opposed the set minimum said students were “gaming the system” and not being prepared for the real world, while the relatively few teachers who supported the floor said it encouraged students in dire circumstances to still apply themselves, the newspaper reported.
Even with the backing of GOP heavyweights in both chambers, the legislation is highly unlikely to pass this year. By state law, only 10 days remain in the regular session. For the House, which is on furlough this week, only nine days remain. And neither bill has gotten a hearing yet.
The only shot at the ban becoming law this year is if it gets inserted into the state budget. And floor debate on the Senate’s spending plan is next week.
Even if it doesn’t, the bill will stay alive for next year, as this is the first of a two-year session.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1381-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 16:11:40.776134

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts that have been widely interpreted as retaliatory.
“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.
In the hours and weeks that followed, the federal government launched a series of investigations into Maine institutions. Below is a running list of the federal government’s actions against the state:

U.S. Department of Justice sues Maine over transgender athlete policy


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday April 16, 2025 3:00 pm












The Trump administration announced Wednesday it is suing Maine over the state’s transgender athlete policy, which the U.S. Attorney General said violates federal anti-discrimination protections.
“The state of Maine is discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women’s sports, pretty basic stuff,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said during a press conference, adding that it is an issue of sports as well as safety.
The Justice Department is launching a civil suit against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools on the basis of sex. Title IX does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.
In a statement in response to the suit, Maine Gov. Janet Mills said it’s the “latest, expected salvo in an unprecedented campaign to pressure the State of Maine to ignore the Constitution and abandon the rule of law.”
“This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states’ rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,” Mills said.

USDA ordered to unfreeze federal funding to Maine


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday April 11, 2025 7:57 pm












A federal court has ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to restore funding to Maine, granting the state’s request for a temporary restraining order.
The ruling marks Maine’s first legal victory against federal sanctions imposed over its policies on transgender athletes — policies the Trump administration argues violate Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in education. At issue is Maine’s decision to allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports, which the federal government claims is unlawful under its interpretation of Title IX.
After the USDA froze the funds earlier this month, Attorney General Aaron Frey on Monday filed a complaint in U.S. District Court seeking to reinstate access to the money this Monday. Four days later, Justicedge John Woodcock Jr.  granted the emergency request, finding that Maine had shown it would suffer “irreparable harm” and that the USDA had failed to follow legally required procedures before halting the funding.
In a statement after the ruling, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said the order “confirms the Trump Administration did not follow the rule of law when it cut program funds that go to feed school children and vulnerable adults.”
“No one in our constitutional republic is above the law and we will continue to fight to hold this administration to account,” Frey said.

Maine, Trump administration ‘at an impasse’ after state refuses to comply with trans athlete policy


By: Lauren McCauley -  4:56 pm












Maine refused to comply with the federal government’s proposed solution to the state allegedly violating Title IX by allowing transgender girls to participate in girls sports.
In a letter to Bradley Burke, regional director for the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster pointed to legal precedent that has required schools to allow trans athletes to participate on teams aligning with their gender identity.
“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” she said. “Your letters to date do not cite a single case that so holds.”
On March 31, the U.S. Department of Education sent Maine officials an impasse letter, which asked the Maine Department of Education to agree to the terms of the federal government’s proposed resolution agreement, which included rescinding policies supporting trans students.
In a response on Friday, Forster said Maine did not agree to the terms of the resolution agreement and would not sign it. The Maine Principal’s Association and Greely High School, the other two entities also under investigation, have also refused to sign the agreement.
“We will not sign the Resolution Agreement, and we do not have revisions to counter propose,” Forster wrote. “We agree that we are at an impasse.”

U.S. Justice Department cuts Maine corrections grants reportedly over transgender policy


By: Lauren McCauley - Tuesday April 8, 2025 2:59 pm












The Maine Department of Corrections said Tuesday that the Department of Justice has terminated federal funding for several grant programs after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told “Fox and Friends”the cuts were because a transgender woman was incarcerated in a woman’s prison.
The DOC said that while it “is aware of related public statements” by Bondi, the department was only provided with a brief communication from the Department of Justice, which states that the awards are being terminated because they “no longer effectuate the program goals or agency priorities,” echoing the language of other notices sent by the Trump administration.
The terminated grants help pay for drug treatment for adults in reentry, programs that foster engagement between incarcerated parents and their children, and resources for corrections agencies to improve post-release supervision in order to prevent recidivism and reduce crime.

Maine AG sues Trump administration for USDA funding freeze that hit school meals


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday April 7, 2025 2:27 pm












The Maine Attorney General is suing the Trump administration for freezing funds that help feed children in schools and childcare centers, as well as adults with disabilities in congregate settings.
Attorney General Aaron Frey filed a complaint Monday with the U.S. District Court in Maine against the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins for their decision to withhold funding because of the state’s alleged violation of Title IX in educational programming.
In a letter sent to Gov. Janet Mills last Wednesday, Rollins that said she was freezing “Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools” and warned it was “only the beginning.” While the letter said the freeze would not affect programs that provide food to children, according to the complaint, the Child Nutrition Program of the Maine Department of Education was unable to access several sources of federal funding the following day.

Pingree calls for acting Social Security director to step down over ‘vindictive actions’


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday April 3, 2025 10:32 am












U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree reiterated her call for Social Security Administration Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek to step down after leaked emails reported on by The Washington Post revealed that he deliberately sought to punish Maine after Gov. Janet Mills’ heated exchange with President Donald Trump over the state’s transgender protections.
On March 6, the Social Security Administration notified the Maine Department of Health and Human Services that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
In a response to an emailed warning from a staff member that the change “would result in improper payments and potential for identity theft,” the acting director made clear that he acting in retaliation.
“While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child,” he wrote. 
In a statement Wednesday, Pingree asked, “If a federal agency can be turned into a political hit squad at the whim of an acting appointee, what checks remain on executive power?”
“Commissioner Dudek’s vindictive actions against Maine represent a fundamental betrayal of public trust that disqualifies him from public service. He should not only resign or be removed from office; he should be investigated for his flagrant abuse of power.” 
By March 7, the agency had reversed course after Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins sought answers about the action. A spokesperson for Collins previously told Maine Morning Star that the Republican received a call from Dudek during which he claimed it was done in error.
When asked about the insult, Mills told reporters: “This is the same guy that admitted that he suspended Maine’s enumeration at birth and funeral directors’ program. First, he said it was a mistake, said it was inadvertent, then, God bless, Sen. King and Sen. Collins got after him and then he admitted he did it on purpose because the governor of Maine was not ‘sufficiently cordial to the president and I said, ‘I can’t speak to that.’”

USDA pausing funding to Maine school programs over alleged Title IX violations


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday April 2, 2025 5:35 pm












The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pausing federal funding for some school programs in response to Maine’s alleged violations of Title IX, though the agency has not conducted a formal investigation.
“You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in a letter to Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday. “Today, I am freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools.
“This is only the beginning,” the letter warned.
School lunch programs, which are funded by the USDA, will not be impacted by the freeze, Rollins said. However, the agency is “reviewing all research and education-related funding in Maine” for compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws “and the priorities of the Trump administration.”
For Maine to continue receiving funding, the state will have to “demonstrate compliance with Title IX’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins’ letter said.

Title IX case against Maine schools headed to U.S. Department of Justice


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday April 1, 2025 4:14 pm












The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

USDA backtracks on university funding halt


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












Less than one week after the University of Maine System was notified that funding for the Maine Sea Grant program had been cut, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on March 5 it would “reopen bilateral negotiations” after appeals from members of Maine’s congressional delegation.
Vice Admiral Nancy Hann credited Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ outreach to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Independent Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree also sent a letter to Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant.

Maine Sea Grant funding cut


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

U.S. Department of Justice threatens to sue Maine


By: Maine Morning Star -  12:27 pm












In a letter to Mills dated Feb. 25, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to sue the state if federal investigations show that “relevant Maine entities are indeed denying girls an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them to compete against” trans girls. 
“Maine should be on notice,” Bondi warned, adding that “the Department of Justice stands ready to take all appropriate action to enforce federal law,” referring to the Trump administration’s interpretation of TItle IX.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines Maine guilty of Title IX violation


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX. 
Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

U.S. Department of Agriculture Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified Maine Gov. Janet Mills and University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy that it had also launched a Title IX review. 
As a land grant university, the University of Maine System receives funding from the agency’s Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which in recent years totaled over $100 million, according to USDA Acting General Counsel Ralph Linden. 
“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Title IX investigation


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:25 pm












On Feb. 21, the same day that the U.S. Department of Education announced its investigation into Maine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights division quickly followed suit. 
The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 15:08:49.198794

The panel, organized by Sen. Graig Meyer (D-Orange) and Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Durham), brought together residents from around the state on Tuesday who largely focused on state and federal cuts to government support as the top issues in their lives, raising fears that basic necessities would become unaffordable for families struggling to make ends meet.
The gathering came a day after state Senate Republicans unveiled a budget aimed at cutting taxes and eradicating perceived government “waste,” amid congressional and Trump administration efforts to strip federal agencies of large chunks of funding.

Debbie McMillan, a social services worker from Columbus County, said even before the ongoing cuts to government aid, her community did not receive enough support — and that as grocery prices continue to rise, families are finding it more difficult to survive.
“Most people, if they have a family, they cannot go to work and receive $7.25 an hour and sustain a family,” McMillan said. “[Lawmakers] want to cut food stamps, they want to cut Medicaid, they want to cut all these programs, but the people need these programs to live.”
Ellie O’Connor and Judy Colwell, both residents of Wilmington, said the same cost of living issues were hitting vulnerable people in their city as well. O’Connor said the influx of wealthy retirees to New Hanover County in recent years was pricing out longtime residents who can no longer afford the region’s rising housing prices.
“We’ve got a lot of people who are coming to the county with money, which kind of edges [out] the people who have lived there for a long time, but are not making a wage that can support their family,” O’Connor said. “The housing is a real issue.”
Colwell said North Carolina needs to raise the minimum wage to help families keep up with rising prices. A resident of an independent living facility, she said staff members have told her it is “impossible to raise their children” while working minimum wage jobs — an obstacle to improving the quality of life for North Carolinians and investing in communities.
“The powers that be, I think they just don’t understand. You hear the phrase all the time, investing in people,” Colwell said. “I don’t think they understand that taking care of people is to their benefit, because people have more money to buy things and a good education will make people able to supply the jobs that corporations need for their labor force.”
Other speakers raised concerns about cuts to public schools and child care, raising concerns that North Carolina is sabotaging its future by failing to properly teach and care for the next generation. Brittany Newton, a member of the Columbus County Deciders, said teachers are quitting their jobs in her community due to insufficient pay.
“So, the classroom sizes are getting bigger and they’re not actually able to do one-on-one teaching with kids,” Newton said. “Some child is being left behind, even though they have a no left behind rule that they’re supposed to be doing.”
Residents also said the state hadn’t done enough to help communities and industries recover from the major disasters of recent years. Katy Rosenbaum, a mother of a young child, said daycares in the state were now being forced to lay off employees because COVID-19 relief funds had stopped before the industry fully recovered.
  North Carolina Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Durham) speaks during a rally opposing school voucher funding on Sept. 9, 2024 in Raleigh.
Jen Hampton, a member of Just Economics, said counties in western North Carolina were forced to cut millions of dollars from their school systems in the wake of the disaster, adding that the lack of tax revenue from the disaster would also devastate local health care facilities and other critical public services. She said rental assistance was also a critical need for the region.
“We are advocating for revenue replacement, unrestricted, so that we don’t have to cut any more public services,” Hampton said. “People have lost their jobs or are underemployed if they can find a job, so we really need a lot more help.”
After the round table concluded, Meyer thanked residents for sharing their concerns and said he and Murdock would be reviewing the issues they’d raised. He added that they planned to write up and circulate what they’d heard in hopes of helping their colleagues better understand the issues facing everyday North Carolinians.
“It shows that the budget really should reflect the people and the interests of the people — and that every piece of this budget, if you knew what was in it, you would have questions about it, you would have ideas for it,” Meyer said. “We will certainly continue to advocate as best we can for you.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230507_221450-1024x565.jpg,,,2025-04-16 15:08:49.198794

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansans can expect to see more of their tax dollars at work within local communities when new rules go into effect next year at the agency in charge of investing state funds.
It’s a version of the “Shop Local” concept in the investment world, said Alex Orel, spokesman for the Kansas Bankers Association, one of the major backers of House Bill 2152, which makes multiple changes affecting banks statewide.
“I think long-term, this is going to be a proposal that’s going to benefit the local governments, our local communities and the state,” Orel said. “Our taxes should be invested here, or as much of them as we can anyway.”
The Pooled Money Investment Board is responsible for investing state general fund dollars and other money deposited with the state treasurer’s office. Among its programs is the Kansas Bank CD Program, which offers Kansas banks the opportunity to invest in certificates of deposit. Depending on the interest rate, which is set weekly, banks can determine whether they want to buy a CD and use those dollars to make loans in their local communities, said Mark Schifferdecker, chairman, president and CEO of GNBank in Girard.
PMIB has been required to get the highest rate of return possible for its CDs, Orel said.
While that makes good investment sense for state dollars, the CD rate was typically set using high-yielding investments, which are above U.S. treasuries, he said. That left Kansas banks no incentive to participate when they could get lower rates elsewhere.
As a result, the Kansas Bank CD Program began to disappear from PMIB’s investment portfolio. As of March 31, it was only 0.48% of the $8.5 billion invested by PMIB, meaning that most of the state’s funds are being invested outside the state.
Schifferdecker said a decade ago, the CD program investment was 10 to 15% of the portfolio.
New regulations included in HB 2152, in effect Jan. 1, 2026, will allow PMIB to offer a more competitive rate, as much as 2% lower, which is expected to increase program participation and bring tax dollars to local banks, which will then distribute them through loans to their customers.
 
At the county level
Brent Shelton, Sedgwick County’s deputy chief financial officer, said HB 2152 has an impact on counties.
Portions of the bill addressed ways to make it easier for banks to hold deposits of county money, along with the increased access to capital through the CD program, he said.
“We give our local banks the first opportunity to keep that money local,” Shelton said. “It also preserves our ability to get a market rate on that money. That helps economic development efforts, makes more money available for lending to local business. All in all, (HB 2152) was a great compromise. Everybody won.”
The “compromise” Shelton referred to was disagreement between county officials and the banking industry on the first version of the bill. In fact, there were about 20 opponents when it was first presented.
Schifferdecker said the Kansas Bankers Association led the charge to draw all the parties to the table and work out the issues. The result was that opponents either switched to becoming proponents or took a neutral stance, he said.
“How often do you see that at the federal and state government anymore?” Schifferdecker said. “I think we made it better. We didn’t everything we wanted — Kansas Bankers Association and me as a banker. They didn’t get everything they wanted. We met in the middle.”
 
The challenges 
Both county officials and PMIB officials were concerned the bill could potentially decrease their investment income. The fiscal note on the bill once it was amended points to decreased revenue for the Kansas Bank CD Program, adding that increased participation in the program is expected.
State General Fund revenues are estimated to decrease by $4.5 million in FY 2026 and by $9 million in FY 2027.
“This analysis only details the impact to the PMIB and does not consider any potential benefits that may be realized from money deposited,” the supplemental note said.
Such longer-term benefits that bankers like Schifferdecker are excited about. A Fort Hays State study, funded by the Kansas Bankers Association, explained the ripple effect seen in communities when banks invest locally.
Specifically, this study considered that when dollars are deposited in a local bank, which can then loan them out repeatedly, their impact on the community will multiply by as much as seven times through increased economic activities.
The study, completed by Emily Breit, policy fellow at the Docking Institute of Public Affairs, found that with the impact of increased income, property and other taxes earned when investments are made in Kansas, out-of-state investments would need to offer rates 3.15% higher than local rates to make the state better off. For example, if a local bank is offering a rate of 5%, then the decision to invest outside the state instead would only generate more value if the outside investment was 8.15% or higher.

“As a community bank, we can loan that money back out to businesses and farmers and consumers,” Schifferdecker said. “We’re not looking at 80% of Kansas money going to be invested in CDs — just to get that back to 10% would be respectable.”
 
A ‘game-changer’ for rural banks
Additional money being invested through rural banks like Schifferbecker’s is another important factor for the state, he said.
“It’s a game changer. Our little bank, we’re in 15 rural markets across Kansas and eastern Colorado. In some of those we’re the only bank in town,” he said. “We can take that money and loan that money back out. We’ve got lots of loan demand, particularly in this ag economy right now, and it’s really critical for us in order for us to grow. There’s only a certain amount of deposits in our little communities. The counties and school districts, they keep quite a bit of money on hand, and if we can attract more of that money, 100% of that money is going to be lent back out to the community.”
Schifferbecker understands why the state invests money outside of its borders to get a higher rate of return. Still, he was glad Kansas lawmakers recognized that long-term benefits will build from what they want to accomplish with HB 2152.
“Money invested locally truly has the multiplier effect; it’s going to raise your tax revenues. Farmers, businesses can expand and grow,” he said. “You make more money and that’s going to create tax revenue.”
Orel at KBA said the banking landscape has changed. This type of support is meaningful for all banks, but especially those in more sparsely populated areas.
“Our community banks don’t have the necessary liquidity they used to have,” he said. “This bill will allow them another liquidity option.”
The banking challenges are reflected in the data from Breit’s study. In 1984, there were 690 FDIC-insured banks and thrifts in Kansas, a number that dropped to 204 by the end of 2023. Number of bank locations grew from 216 to 1,100 in that same time period. Community banks play an important role, Breit’s research said, by maintaining banking services in rural areas where larger banking businesses don’t typically locate.
“We’re so happy,” Schifferdecker said. “I was just tickled when it passed the Senate overwhelmingly and then the House.”

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)The Trump administration announced Wednesday it is suing Maine over the state’s transgender athlete policy, which U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said violates federal anti-discrimination protections.
“The state of Maine is discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women’s sports, pretty basic stuff,” Bondi said during a press conference, adding that it is an issue of sports as well as safety.
The Justice Department is launching a civil suit against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools on the basis of sex. Title IX does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.
In response to the suit, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said it’s the “latest, expected salvo in an unprecedented campaign to pressure the State of Maine to ignore the Constitution and abandon the rule of law.”
“This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,” Mills said.
Mills and President Donald Trump had a tense exchange at the White House on Feb. 21 after Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his recent executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on women’s sports teams consistent with their gender identity.
“You better do it because you’re not going to get federal funding,” Trump told Mills during an event with the National Governors Association captured by a press pool recording.
“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” replied Mills, who was attending the organization’s winter summit.
“Enjoy your life after governor, because I don’t think you’ll be an elected official afterwards,” Trump responded. Mills’ second term ends in 2027.
Bre Kidman-Danvers, executive director of MaineTransNet, said the lawsuit is an example of executive overreach.
“What the executive branch is actually doing at this moment is trampling over” the rights of Congress to dictate federal spending and “unilaterally deciding how laws should be interpreted,” which is the job of the judiciary, she said.
In a statement Wednesday, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said he looks forward to representing the state.
Ultimately, Frey said, “this matter is about the protections afforded by Title IX and the Maine Human Rights Act,” which includes gender as a protected class.
He said he is confident the state is “acting in accordance with those laws,” a position that he said is bolstered by the “complete lack of any legal citation supporting the Administration’s position in its own complaint.”










This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law.


– Maine Gov. Janet Mills


On Friday, the Maine Attorney General’s Office sent a letter to the U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights saying it would not comply with the department’s proposed resolution agreement, which would require the state to end its transgender protections. The state also doubled down on its assertion that the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX does not have legal standing.
In a letter to Bradley Burke, regional director for the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster pointed to legal precedent that has required schools to allow trans athletes to participate on teams aligning with their gender identity.
“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” she said. “Your letters to date do not cite a single case that so holds.”
Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby appeared at the Wednesday morning press conference alongside Bondi and Education Secretary Linda McMahon. The Auburn Republican has been at the center of this controversy. After sharing photos and identifying information about a transgender student athlete on her legislative Facebook page, she was censured by her peers and stripped of the right to vote or speak on the Maine House floor until she apologizes.
That post went viral and prompted the Trump administration’s scrutiny of Maine’s policy.
Bondi read off two examples of trans girls placing in girls athletic competitions, skiing and track, and recounted the initial exchange between President Donald Trump and Mills during which the Democratic governor said she’d see Trump “in court.”
Bondi also noted that two federal departments, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, deemed Maine in violation of Title IX after brief investigations into the matter.
“We have exhausted every other remedy,” Bondi said of the suit. “We tried to get Maine to comply. We don’t like standing up here and filing lawsuits, we want to get states to comply with us.”
Bondi pointed to the many ways the federal government has punished Maine. “We’ve stripped grants from Maine through other departments and we are going to continue to fight for women,” she said.
Mills also spoke to what she described as the “politically motivated investigations that opened and closed without discussion” and referenced Friday’s federal court order requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to unfreeze payments related to Maine’s school meal programs, which the governor said “reinforces our position that the federal government has been acting unlawfully.”
“Let today serve as warning to all states: Maine might be among the first to draw the ire of the Federal government in this way, but we will not be the last,” Mills said.
Some Republican legislators have pushed for Maine to concede to the Trump administration’s demands, with several proposing legislation that would ban trans athletes — LD 233 and LD 868 — as well as another bill that would remove gender identity from the Maine Human Rights Act. Those bills have not yet been scheduled for a public hearing.
Asked about the choice before legislators right now, Kidman-Danvers said, “Scapegoating trans people is not going to protect Maine’s federal funding.”
“If you compromise that right, it is a slippery slope,” she said. “Once you start eroding civil rights protections, they are all up for grabs.”

In the marquee governor’s race, Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger has soared to an early financial lead, raising $6.7 million to Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears’ $3.1 million. Spanberger enters the heart of campaign season with $11 million cash on hand — nearly three times more than her GOP opponent. 
Earle-Sears’ total, however, comes despite a significant fundraising constraint: as a sitting legislator, she was prohibited from soliciting donations during much of the General Assembly session.
“I think it’s important to note that that funding gap will narrow now that the legislative session is over,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. “Now that the lieutenant governor is a Republican nominee, I imagine some Republicans were waiting for a resolution of the nomination process before weighing in with donations.”
Fundraising is more than just a vanity metric — it’s often a key indicator of campaign strength and viability. The flow of early money offers a roadmap for where parties and donors see the biggest opportunities or threats.
DLCC pours money into Virginia races, citing ‘All eyes on 2025’

In the crowded race for lieutenant governor, 12 contenders reported a combined $2.4 million. Republican Pat Herrity leads with $540,000, followed closely by Democrat Levar Stoney, the former Richmond mayor, at $429,000. Democrats Aaron Rouse and Babur Lateef are virtually tied at just under $400,000, while Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, trails at $306,000.
Farnsworth said that Stoney’s strong showing is likely helped by a familiar fundraising machine – former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who endorsed Stoney’s bid early on. 
“McAuliffe’s greatest skill as a politician has always been fundraising. And that pipeline will be very useful to the former mayor,” he said. 
The race for attorney general has also attracted big money early. Incumbent Jason Miyares, a Republican, raised $1.5 million in the first quarter, while former Del. Jay Jones of Norfolk, aiming for a comeback after his 2021 primary loss, followed with $931,000. Democrat Shannon Taylor, the Henrico Commonwealth’s Attorney, pulled in $534,000.
Meanwhile, the 286 candidates running for the House of Delegates brought in $5.2 million altogether. Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, sits atop the pile with $813,000. But it’s a Democratic challenger from Southwest Virginia who may be drawing the most attention — and dollars.
Lily Franklin, who narrowly lost to Republican Chris Obenshain in 2023 by just 183 votes, is leading all battleground Democrats this quarter with over $190,000 raised. She has collected more than $245,000 this cycle, putting her in a strong position to flip House District 41.
“We’re seeing big investments in Southwest Virginia — and they’re coming from everyday people,” Franklin said. “With nearly 2,000 donations and a median gift of just $25, this is a community-led movement fueled by our neighbors.”
Obenshain, who reported $50,000 raised this quarter, dismissed the fundraising numbers as political theater. 
“It’s no surprise that my opponent has used her career as a political operative to raise money from left-wing special interest groups that care more about Washington, D.C. than Southwest Virginia,” he said, touting his legislative record on tax cuts, childcare, electric bills and public safety.
Farnsworth, the political scientist, noted the strategic importance of Franklin’s campaign. 
“Early political money especially is going to be targeted to the greatest opportunities for the party, and the closeness of the last election in this district and the money Democrats are raising suggest that this may be one of the top priorities for Democrats this cycle,” he said.
Republicans in swing districts unite in ‘Purple Caucus’ ahead of Va. House races

That trend is especially visible in Virginia’s so-called Purple Caucus — a group of about one dozen House Republicans in vulnerable suburban and swing districts. 
One of its leaders, Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City County, appears financially underwater, raising just over $15,000 in Q1. Her Democratic challenger, Jessica Anderson, brought in more than $116,000 from over 1,300 small-dollar donors.
“There’s no doubt about it,” Farnsworth said, “if you’re in the Purple Caucus, you’re potentially vulnerable, and the fundraising game may be a key part of trying to keep that seat.”
Another GOP incumbent facing pressure is Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, who is trying to fend off a three-way Democratic primary. Coyner raised $131,000 last quarter, making her the highest-earning Republican in the House. Dustin Wade leads the Democratic field with $69,000, followed by Lindsey Daugherty and Stephen Miller-Pitts.
Elsewhere, House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, who is eyeing a federal appointment as U.S. Attorney, has raised $119,000. His Democratic challenger, Catherine Elizabeth Rec, has pulled in just $1,400 since launching her campaign in February.
And in the only Republican House primary so far, Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, has dramatically outraised challenger Austen Schwend with $30,000 to just under $3,000.
With more than six months until Election Day, the cash race is just getting started. But in Virginia politics, early dollars often spell early momentum — and that’s something no candidate can afford to ignore.

López Askin, is so far the only Secretary of State candidate in the 2026 election. Current Secretary of State Maggie Tolouse Oliver has served two consecutive terms, and cannot run for the seat in the upcoming election. The position is third in succession, behind the governor and lieutenant governor. The Secretary of State administers elections, enforces ethics and keeps official records for state government.
Doña Ana County commissioners appointed López Askin to the office just two months before the 2018 mid-term elections after the previous county clerk resigned; she has since won two elections to keep the seat in 2020 and 2024.
López Askin will not step down from the Doña Ana County Clerk’s office during the campaign, she told Source, saying she will work more and lean on Deputy County Clerk Caroline Zamora.
“I’ll be working double-time evenings and weekends,” she said. “But I will continue to lead the office in Doña Ana County.”
López Askin said she has the “perseverance and dedication” to fight electoral changes at the federal level, such as House Republicans voting for a bill that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote, and the Trump Administration’s recent orders to overhaul election rules,
“It’s never been more important to protect the right to vote,” she said. “I’ve been battle-tested. Since 2018, I have been challenged. I have had to deal with extremists and election deniers and litigation. And in every single instance, I defended what we do, and I defended it well.”
Those challenges included a death threat  by former Republican candidate Solomon Peña, before his arrest for organizing four shootings at the homes of four Democratic politicians after he lost an election for a New Mexico House of Representatives seat.
López Askin has a masters in marriage and family therapy, along with a PhD in educational leadership from New Mexico State University.
According to campaign finance records, López Askin has just under $19,000 in the campaign’s coffers, transferred from her previous county clerk campaign.

(Courtesy of Dr. Priya Bansal)Patients in five states who have severe asthma and are covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield are facing a new obstacle to getting treatment.
On Tuesday, BCBS began mandating that severe asthma patients self-administer their drugs at home, unless their provider gets prior approval from the insurance company.
The patients affected are those covered in Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Montana, but not those with Medicare or Medicaid, the insurance giant says. Those five states are included in a combined BCBS plan which is owned by Health Care Service Corporation.
In a statement, the corporation said the change is “being made with the interests of our members in mind — promoting access to treatment that is convenient and effective.”
Given as injections, the treatments in question are Fasenra (benralizumab), Tezspire (tezepelumab), Nucala (mepolizumab) and Xolair (omalizumab). All belong to a class of drugs known as biologics.
The decision is expected to affect thousands of patients. It’s estimated that between 5% and 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, characterized by more flare-ups and hospitalizations. In Illinois, for example, about 860,000 patients have asthma, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means between 43,000 and 86,000 of them have severe asthma.
Clinics already have loads of prior authorizations to process that often delay care, said Dr. Priya Bansal, a pediatrician and asthma and allergy physician in Illinois. Her practice sees many rural patients and those with chronic disease.
“On any given day, we’ll have anywhere from 30, to my highest was 130,” she said.
The change interferes with a provider and patient decision on whether in-office or at-home treatment is best for the patient, Bansal said.
“That decision that’s supposed to go on between the physician and the patient is getting taken away,” she said. “If I have a pediatric food allergy patient and they want to get the medication in the clinic, I want to be able to have the flexibility to do that.”
The sickest asthma patients are often on biologics, explained Dr. Bridgette Jones, past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ drug committee and the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology’s asthma cough diagnosis and treatment panel.
“These are the patients that have failed at other therapies,” said Jones, a pediatric allergy and immunology physician at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Missouri. “Once you’re getting to a biologic, it means that your asthma is not under control, having frequent flare-ups.”
Black and Indigenous adults and children, as well as Puerto Rican people have higher rates of illness and less access to care.
For people who suffer from severe asthma, the typical inhaler is often not enough. The affected drugs can help manage severe, uncontrolled asthma by reducing airway inflammation,
While the drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for self-injecting at home, they also come with risks for the uncommon but life-threatening anaphylaxis. That’s why providers typically start patients on these drugs in-office for monitoring. But for at least one of the drugs, Xolair, the reaction can also happen up to a year into treatment.
Many families are not comfortable administering biologics to their kids with severe asthma, Jones said. Clinics serving higher-need or underserved populations may often lack the resources to deal with more prior approvals, she added.
A recent study by Massachusetts General Hospital and funded by Amgen, which developed Tezspire with AstraZeneca, suggested that in some states, the percentage of asthma patients with severe asthma is higher than 10%. In Texas, for example, about 23% of severe persistent asthma had severe uncontrolled disease.
This story has been updated with a statement from Health Care Service Corporation and to clarify why the change only affects patients in five states.

States were issued letters earlier this month from the U.S. Department of Education, calling on officials to “certify their compliance with their anti-discrimination obligations in order to continue receiving federal financial assistance.” Gov. Ned Lamont and Connecticut Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker announced Wednesday that the state responded to the request and will not sign it.
In the letter dated April 15, Russell-Tucker wrote to the federal Education Department that Connecticut and state officials are already in compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
“We will continue to build on the collective efforts of our educators, families, and school communities to create learning environments where every student is valued and supported,” Russell-Tucker said in a statement. “We remain focused on the work happening in our schools every day and are staunchly committed to ensuring that all our 508,402 students have access to a universe of opportunities.”
Lamont echoed that sentiment on Wednesday.
“In Connecticut, we’re proud to support the incredible diversity of our schools and work tirelessly to ensure that every child, regardless of background, has access to a quality education and the best opportunity at the starting line in life,” Lamont said in a statement. “From our educators, who are mentoring and inspiring the next generation of young people, to our curriculum, our commitment to education is what has made our schools nationally recognized, and we plan to continue doing what makes our students, teachers, and schools successful.”
Hundreds of millions of dollars that Connecticut receives from the federal government in K-12 education assistance could be at risk.
Specifically, the April 3 letter from the U.S. Department of Education threatened to pull back Title I, which provides funding to support school districts with high concentrations of students from low-income backgrounds. 
Connecticut received about $553 million in federal funding for education during the 2023-2024 school year, according to School and State Finance Project. About half of that funding goes toward Title I and special education through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, also known as IDEA.
While education is mostly controlled at the state and local level, certain municipalities would feel the strain of federal changes or cuts more than others. Connecticut’s biggest cities rely much more heavily on those dollars. For Waterbury, 22% of its school funding comes from the federal government, with much of it going to Title I.
Outside Betances Elementary School in Hartford on Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., challenged the federal policies, calling them “just plain dumb and cruel.”
“This so-called guidance that threatens a loss of funding saying, ‘We’re gonna eliminate all of the hundreds of millions of dollars that Connecticut received in funding if it continues social-emotional learning,’ when, in fact, these kinds of services help stop violence, promote academic success and make students feel better about going to school,” Blumenthal said.
“This kind of policy ought to be rescinded as quickly as possible so students can be taught the basic kinds of tools they need to build friendships and avoid conflict and stop violence. It’s really pretty simple, but the Trump administration seems on a DEI bender toward destroying American education, and this particular aspect of it is so important, not just emotionally, but also academically,” Blumenthal continued.
In recent years, the Connecticut legislature has worked to diversify its teaching workforce, as several studies have shown that having educators in classrooms who look like their students can improve academic performance.
In 2023, the state legislature passed the Aspiring Educators Diversity Scholarship Program, which has begun to provide up to $10,000 annually to graduates from Alliance Districts to go into the teaching profession.
Legislation proposed this year that passed out of the state’s Education Committee would expand the scholarship beyond the state’s 33 Alliance Districts — the lowest-performing schools — to any Connecticut high school graduate, with hopes the scholarship could also diversify the workforce by bringing more men into classrooms, Committee Co-Chair Doug McCrory, D-Hartford, said at a committee meeting on March 24.
Blumenthal fears these kinds of initiatives are at risk as well.
“This policy of denigrating diversity is just plain dumb. It’s dumb and cruel because we want students to look at their teachers and see themselves,” Blumenthal said. “If they’re kids of color, if they’re kids of different religions and backgrounds, we want teachers to reflect their classrooms, and so saying, ‘Oh, we don’t want diversity in teachers’ is just really stupid. I hate to use that word. I always told my children never to call someone stupid, but this is stupid.”
Last week, Blumenthal signed a letter from a dozen lawmakers across the country that urged the federal Department of Education to “immediately rescind” correspondence sent to state education leaders in February that alleged that public education has “toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices.”
In document released by the federal Department of Education titled “Frequently Asked Questions About Racial Preferences and Stereotypes Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act”, the department hinted that diversity, equity and inclusion efforts may be unlawful.
“Many schools have advanced racially discriminatory policies and practices under the banner of ‘DEI’ initiatives. Other schools have sought to veil racially discriminatory policies with terms like ‘social-emotional learning’ or ‘culturally responsive’ teaching,” the document states.
“But whether an initiative constitutes unlawful discrimination does not turn solely on whether it is labeled ‘DEI’ or uses terminology such as ‘diversity,’ ‘equity,’ or ‘inclusion.’ OCR’s assessment of school policies and programs depends on the facts and circumstances of each case,” the document continues. “Schools may not operate policies or programs under any name that intentionally treat students differently based on race, engage in racial stereotyping, or create hostile environments for students of particular races.”
Lawmakers across the country have opposed the Education Department’s interpretations. In an April 9 letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Craig Trainor, the acting assistant for the Civil Rights Department of Education, Blumenthal and about a dozen other lawmakers — including Cory Booker, D-N.J., Suzanne Bonamici, D-Mich., and Summer Lee, D-Pa., said the guidance from the federal government has begun to “mischaracterize federal civil rights laws, overturn state and local control laws and practices, invade local curricula decisions, and threaten the rescission of critical federal funding.”
The letter also addressed social-emotional learning.
“The FAQ document spreads misinformation by falsely suggesting, without evidence, that social and emotional learning (SEL) and culturally responsive teaching are discriminatory,” the lawmakers’ letter states. “Although SEL can take place anywhere, SEL in schools often refers to educational practices, frameworks, and programs that create supportive environments and opportunities for students to learn and practice social and emotional skills.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0319_SR_Hearing_315-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 15:08:49.198794

(Via Florida State Parks)Amid growing concerns over a plan to drill for oil and gas near the Apalachicola River, a proposal by two North Florida lawmakers to ban oil exploration and drilling in that region passed unanimously in the Florida House on Wednesday.
The bill (HB 1143) is sponsored by Republican Jason Shoaf and Democrat Allison Tant. It would ban the drilling, exploration, or production of oil, gas, or other petroleum products within 10 miles of a national estuarine research reserve.
There are three such reserves in Florida — the Apalachicola in North Florida, the Guana Tolomato Matanzas in Ponta Verde Beach, and Rookery Bay in Naples.
The bill sponsors have said that their legislation is a response to a decision last December by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to permit an exploratory oil well near the Apalachicola River in Calhoun County.
“When this oil drilling initiative was announced in our press, my entire community, all of North Florida, went on fire,” said Tant. “It was an organic response by people here in this area who just were devastated by this possibility.”
Shoaf noted that Sunday marks the 15th anniversary of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, an event that led to miles of oiled beaches in the Florida Panhandle.
“During the oil spill, just the threat of oil coming to our area completely crippled our economy and now we face another threat that is starting to really scare the entire community,” Shoaf said on the House floor.
Pinellas County Democratic Rep. Lindsay Cross also noted the anniversary of the BP oil spill, which lasted for 87 days and was the largest marine oil spill in U.S. history, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
“In just a few days, we will remember the 11 men who were killed during that tragedy and the horrific impact to our natural areas, our wildlife, and also to our economy here in the state of Florida,” she said. “Despite being hundreds of miles away, tourism in the Tampa Bay area plummeted, and I know that in places in the Panhandle with oil washing onto the shores, this was a real threat.”
The bill calls for the DEP to conduct a “balancing test” when a permit application is submitted. The test must include the community’s conditions, hydrological connections, uniqueness, location, fish and wildlife use, time lag, and the potential cost of restoration in case of an explosion, blowout, or spill.
The bill has one significant difference with its Senate companion, sponsored by North Florida Republican Corey Simon (SB 1300). That measure does not include language about banning development within 10 miles of a reserve.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)The Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority will likely not see state funding from this session.
House Bill 848, which would have taken $2 million from the railroad car tax and directed it to the authority, failed 23-27 on second reading in the Senate. The tax brings in about $4 million annually and the money currently goes into the general fund.  
“We are not deterred easily,” Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority chairman Dave Strohmaier said Wednesday after the floor vote. “In spite of what may seem a setback, we’re full steam ahead.”
The bill was carried by Rep. Denise Baum, D-Billings, who pushed for months to get movement on legislation. It found broad support from legislators in the House, as well as both the Senate and House transportation committees.
However, during its Senate transportation hearing, lobbyists representing large industry interests testified against the bill. Most of their issues were based around the railroad tax being used to fund the agency.
“I don’t think any of the opponents would probably be here today if it weren’t for the funding mechanism in this bill,” BNSF lobbyist Matt Jones said on April 9.
He added that new passenger rail should not interfere with existing freight rail and, “the freight industry and freight customers should not be expected to subsidize passenger service.”
Montana Petroleum Association lobbyist Sonny Capece said it would contribute to congestion on the railway. He added it wasn’t a viable option.
“Let the private industry do it. If private industry can make this profitable, let them do it,” Capece said. “There’s plenty of private railroads nationwide that exist on a profit-making model. This one is not one of them.”
Dan Bucks, former Director of Revenue for Montana and a proponent of the bill, said the legislation wouldn’t have increased the tax. In fact, he said, he was familiar with the tax through his former position running the revenue department.
“It’s nearly impossible for the state to even contemplate increasing the rail car tax because of a federal law called the 4R Act that sets very tight standards for how the tax is levied,” Bucks said. 
Funding the authority could be a boon for everyone, he added.
“We are not focused simply on passenger rail, but also on improving the freight system for its own sake, for agricultural ship rules, mineral shippers and anybody else shipping out of Montana or using the rails for freight,” Bucks said during a hearing on April 9. “We’re interested in improving the freight service and the passenger service together so that we reduce any delay.”
Two lines in Montana have already been picked as viable routes for increased passenger rail. Both proposed passenger rail routes going through Montana would be longer than 750 miles, meaning the federal government would be primarily responsible for running the route.
It would cost billions to get passenger rail routes fully operational, but proponents of the legislation said much of the money would come from the federal government. Congress, in fact, would likely have to approve any spending on passenger rail of that magnitude.
And even then, HB 848’s funding would have gone to figuring out where the major hurdles for passenger rail would be. It would also help them match and leverage federal funding to move the project forward.
“You have to have a steady or stable funding source to be able to unlock that match,” Baum said.
On the floor, the bill saw trouble immediately as Senators received a letter on their desk signed by lobbyists from the Treasure State Resource Association, the Montana Wood Products Association, the Montana Coal Council, the Montana Grain Growers Association, the Montana Agricultural Business Association, the Montana Petroleum Association, the Montana Grain Elevator Association, the Montana Mining Association, the Montana Farm Bureau Federation and the Montana Chamber of Commerce.
“Although HB 848 redirects receipts from an existing rail tax, it creates an unacceptable precedent where freight rail customers are subsidizing passenger rail initiatives,” according to the letter, which was distributed by Sen. Shelley Vance, R-Belgrade. “Whether intentional or not, it also creates a potential expectation that freight shippers will be expected to contribute additional revenue in the future.
“Passenger rail does not benefit freight rail customers. In fact, it has the potential to interfere with the existing service we rely on.”
On the floor, the legislation saw some support, while detractors, including Majority Leader Tom McGillvary, R-Billings, essentially said passenger rail expansion was a fever dream.
“This is the most absurd bill I have seen this session,” McGillvary said. “If you vote yes on this bill you’re living in a fantasy land.”
Following the failed vote, the bill was indefinitely postponed.
There was some frustration from rail supporters about how the discussion went.
“There was a lack of understanding about what we’ve accomplished in the last four years,” Strohmaier said.

For me, each encounter strengthened my resolve to find justice for them.  That meant two things: holding the people who hurt them accountable but also doing whatever I could to help put the victim’s life back together. 
Along with my colleagues in law enforcement, I was often the first person to speak at length with the victim of a violent crime. In addition to gathering facts that may be useful in court, I did my best  to explain the criminal justice process: what the victim should expect, what they may be asked to  do, and how long it may take to resolve their case. But supporting victims is about so much more  than that.  
Much of the real work of supporting victims happens outside the legal system — through a network of nonprofit and government agencies that quietly and steadily work with survivors to heal and move forward, here in Tennessee and across the country. Without them, resources like temporary housing for victims of domestic violence, crisis hotlines, and counseling services for victims would  simply not be available. Prosecutors are also less likely to have victims cooperate and testify if victims are overwhelmed with challenges unrelated to the legal system — whether it’s a place to  stay, coping with trauma or some other basic need.  
Tennessee victim-serving agencies warn cuts will be ‘catastrophic’ if Gov. Bill Lee fails to act

Perhaps recognizing the value of victim service providers, Gov. Bill Lee’s most recent  supplemental budget includes a one-time request for $20 million over two years for these  organizations. This is a positive step, but still far less than the $25 million in recurring annual  funding that victims’ rights agencies and their allies have identified as essential. Across the nation, federal funding for victim-serving agencies such as nonprofits and shelters is quickly dwindling.  These cuts would be particularly devastating in Tennessee, which has declined to provide consistent state-level funding for victim services in recent years.  
To be clear, these kinds of services are not luxuries for people fleeing violence. What we  sometimes blandly refer to as “victims services” include professionals who provide crucial support  to victims and their children. Further reductions to federal resources would force them to shut  down — and in some parts of Tennessee, service providers are already closing. Funding cuts could  have an exceptionally devastating impact on crime victims in rural communities who already lack  access to many kinds of support.  
To put the $25 million request from victim service providers in perspective, the Tennessee  Department of Correction spent over $900 million on incarceration in 2023. Rather than focusing  disproportionately on jailing those who commit crimes, our justice system should also invest in  serving victims and their families. And the resources are available — last year, Lee’s office claimed that the state’s “rainy day fund” of reserves had topped a record $2  billion.  
Establishing a substantial and recurring fund is absolutely vital to protect the safety, dignity, and  well-being of those who have been impacted by crime. By making a long-term investment in these community-based organizations, our criminal justice system can better serve those who are  harmed by crime and ensure that no victim suffers alone.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A proposal that would limit development in state parks and ensure maximum public scrutiny of changes to their management was approved unanimously in the Florida House of Representatives on Wednesday, 115-0.
The measure, called the State Park Preservation Act, (HB 209) follows outrage felt across the board last summer after the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) proposed to construct lodges, golf courses, pickleball courts, and disc golf courses in nine state parks.
South Florida Republican Peggy Gossett-Seidman, who co-sponsored the measure with Southeast Florida Republican John Snyder, said she received more than 1,500 emails from an angry public the week after reports about the proposal made news headlines up and down Florida last August.
The bill says that state parks must be managed to provide the greatest benefit to the state, with plans for managed areas larger than 1,000 acres required to provide an analysis.
The bill also requires the DEP to provide a report to the governor and Legislature regarding the status and operation of state parks. Additionally, the bill revises notice requirements for public meetings. It says that the Division of State Lands shall make available to the public an electronic copy of each land management plan at least 30 days before the public hearing required for parcels that exceed 160 acres in size and for parcels located within a state park.
When the development proposal was released last summer, it drew scorn from lawmakers from both political parties, including Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and former Chief Financial Officer and now U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis.
“Public lands should be enjoyed and protected,” Simpson said on X at the time. “We have to be really careful when we talk about building infrastructure in state parks.”
“I think we were all shocked what they were going to do for our precious state parks,” said Broward County Democratic Rep. Robin Bartleman on Wednesday.  
“And this is in direct response to that plan and a direct response to what our constituents wanted us to do. They spoke loud and clear and told us that these are our treasures and that we’re not going to construct pickleball courts and golf courses and hotels, that we’re going to do what’s right. I feel really good today because we can turn to them and say, we’ve heard you and we acted.”
‘Treasured places’
Following passage of the bill, the Sierra Club issued a statement thanking the House.
“On behalf of Sierra Club Florida’s 38,000 members and 150,000 supporters, thank you for listening to the outcry of thousands of Floridians who rallied last summer and again in recent weeks to defend these treasured places. This is a tremendous victory for our environment, and all who call our state home,” said Susannah Randolph, of Sierra Club Florida.
The Senate version, sponsored by Southeast Florida Republican Gayle Harrell (SB 80) has passed unanimously in its two previous committees and has one more stop before the Senate Fiscal Policy Committee before reaching the floor.

Representative Jay Adams […],"NC Driver's License (File photo)North Carolina legislators say one of the most common complaints they receive from constituents is just how long it takes for motorists to get an appointment at their Division of Motor Vehicles office. Now House Bill 821 would impose a temporary moratorium on the expiration date on certain Class C drivers licenses.
Representative Jay Adams (R-Catawba) said the bill is intended to alleviate the concern that people have about getting their licenses renewed at a time that they are struggling to get an appointment at their local DMV office.

“Right now, apparently you cannot make an appointment to get your license renewal anywhere in the state,” Adams explained. “I spoke to somebody the day before yesterday who spent five hours getting his daughter’s driver’s license issued.”
Under HB 821, a Class C driver’s license would remain valid for a period of up to two years after its expiration, allowing the motorist to continue driving without the risk of penalty in the state while the backlog is cleared at the DMV. It would not apply to drivers with a canceled, revoked, or suspended license.
“Has anybody articulated from the department what these challenges are stemming from? Is it personnel? Is it funding?” asked Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover.)
Adams told the House Transportation Committee from his perspective the NCDMV has moved away from their core responsibilities, and it would take a lot of reorganization to resolve the current backlog.
“I look at it from a business standpoint, and their operations are not very well organized,” Adams replied.
Rep. Phil Shepard, the committee co-chair, agreed with the bill sponsor.
“Just this week, I’ve received a complaint from a constituent. Her license expires in a month and she called to get an appointment and the appointment is after her license expires. So she said, ‘What am I supposed to do?'”
  Rep. Harry Warren (R-Rowan) (Photo: NCGA Screengrab)
Shepard also agreed with Butler’s suggestion that the legislature needed to study why the DMV was continuing to have problems in serving the public and how best to resolve those pressure points.
“This bill would basically be facilitating the incompetency of the DMV by alleviating them of the responsibility of their job,” responded Rep. Harry Warren (R-Rowan) bluntly.
 
Warren said while the current DMV commissioner has worked to modernize the agency, the position should not be a political appointment.
“I’ve been here for three different gubernatorial administrations, and I haven’t seen any improvement in that department worth noting,” said Warren.
Rep. Donnie Loftis (R-Gaston) said many North Carolinians wait until the final weeks before their license expired to try to get an appointment. He also reminded his colleagues that it often takes more than six months to fill vacant positions at many state agencies, leaving fewer workers to serve a growing state.
“That’s one of the major barriers, and I made the comment to the [DMV] commissioner if you don’t fix this, we’ll privatize it.”

Commissioner Wayne Goodwin announced in February his plans to leave the beleaguered agency as soon as a replacement could be found.
This week, the Senate included in its budget proposal a plan to establish a new nine-member Board of Motor Vehicles that would appoint the DMV commissioner, removing that appointment from the state Secretary of Transportation and the governor.
With Wednesday’s approval, House Bill 821 (Drivers License Expiration Moratorium) heads next to the House Finance Committee.
Rep. Loftis reminded his colleagues that even if the bill becomes law, North Carolina motorists would be wise to continue to seek their renewal in a timely manner.

The March deployment was set to last for 12 months and cost the state an estimated $9 million. Troops were first sent to Texas to support Gov. Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star last year under former Gov. Eric Holcomb. 
“We are proud to welcome home these brave Hoosier Guardsmen and thank them for their service during this successful mission,” said Braun in a statement. “Under the leadership of President Trump, well-managed border security is a priority and that enables these Guardsmen to return home.”

Recent data documents a 94% drop in border crossings compared to one year ago. 
During the first border rotation, Hoosiers detected 2,639 individual crossings, supported 35 surrenders and “impacted” 8,837 turn backs, according to the guard. The 50 guardsmen sent last month had 559 interactions, a news release said. 
“I commend the soldiers on this mission, and for the work they’ve done to secure our border,” said Brig. Gen. Larry Muennich, the adjutant general. “I look forward to welcoming them back home soon. This is an example of how the Indiana National Guard always stands ready to support our state and nation when called.”
The soldiers will return to the state within 60 days.

The legislation, House File 472, is known as an anti-SLAPP bill — referring to a measure intended to combat “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP lawsuits. These are civil lawsuits filed by organizations or individuals against entities such as news organizations or activists not with the expectation of winning the case, but to discourage them from publishing articles or speaking publicly on an issue by engaging them in a long, expensive legal battle.
“In most cases, these actual tort claims for defamation or other related theories are weak and (lack) merit, but those purposes are tied to the speaker’s legal fees and make them back down,” Sen. Jeff Reichman, R-Montrose, the floor manager for the bill, said.
The measure would provide protections for those facing such lawsuits by allowing expedited relief in court for cases related to First Amendment rights, including freedoms of speech and press.
The House has passed anti-SLAPP bills in several previous legislative sessions with bipartisan support that have failed to advance in the Senate. During House debate on the bill, Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, said he has attempted to pass anti-SLAPP measures since 2018. Those efforts were in response to a 2018 lawsuit against the Carroll Times Herald filed by a Carroll police officer who sued the newspaper after reporting that he had sexual relationships with teenagers, which the officer had admitted to. While the judge dismissed the case, the legal dispute “almost put them out of business,” Holt said.
Though no senators but Reichman spoke on the bill Wednesday, the measure was unanimously approved by the chamber.
The Senate amended the legislation to state the protections only apply to civil actions filed on or after the bill’s enactment — removing a provision in the original House bill that expedited relief could also be granted to a “cause of action asserted in a civil action.” With the bill’s passage in the Senate, it moves back to the House for approval of the amendment before it can go to Gov.

Debbie Mayfield. (Photo courtesy of the House of Representatives)With no debate, the House voted 111-1 on Wednesday to prohibit unelected state employees from conducting campaign-type activities during working hours and require agency heads to live in Tallahassee.
Similar legislation is advancing in the Senate, but Gov. Ron DeSantis has signaled that he will veto the proposal if it reaches his desk.
The governor has targeted Melbourne Republican Rep. Debbie Mayfield’s bill, HB 1445, during press conferences this week, saying it would become law “over his veto pen.”
State employees couldn’t participate in political campaigns, solicit contributions, or use their authority to influence people’s votes under the bill. Those prohibitions would apply both to candidate and issue campaigns, and employees could face first-degree misdemeanor penalties if they do so.
The sole vote against HB 1445 came from Delray Beach Republican Rep. Mike Caruso, the only House lawmaker standing with the governor this year.
Mayfield referred to her proposal on the House floor as good public policy. HB 1445 makes “several changes with the goal of ensuring that our elected officials and our appointed officials are fully committed and focused on their primary duties of serving the state of Florida,” the sponsor said.
DeSantis hasn’t publicly addressed the anti-politicking aspect of the legislation. Instead, he has focused on the requirement that his appointees live in the state capital by Oct. 1, the location of all agency headquarters.
“They’re pulling it out of their rear ends and trying to jam it through this process. Over my veto pen,” DeSantis said, likening Tallahassee to the D.C. swamp.

State employees’ involvement in politics
The involvement by state officials in DeSantis’ campaign against the ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana and restore abortion access prompted legal challenges last year and has come under renewed scrutiny this legislative session.
State House deepens probe of Hope Florida Foundation’s political activity

A House panel is investigating the transfer of legal settlement money through the Hope Florida Foundation to campaign against the marijuana initiative. Then-DeSantis’ chief of staff, now state attorney general, James Uthmeier organized the money transfer to the anti-pot committee, Keep Florida Clean, which he ran, according to evidence unearthed by reporters and a House committee.
Uthmeier played down any suggestion of wrongdoing during a press conference Monday, saying there’s “not a problem.”
Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo appeared in press conferences against the marijuana constitutional amendment and got sued over the health department’s letters threatening broadcasters that aired ads on behalf of the pro-abortion-rights campaign, Amendment 4.
Additionally, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration’s creation of a webpage stating that Amendment 4 “threatens women’s safety” and its then-secretary Jason Weida’s promotion of it prompted a complaint to the Florida Supreme Court, which ultimately sided with the DeSantis administration because the plaintiff lacked standing to sue.
Aside from the DeSantis administration’s use of state resources against the ballot initiatives last year, state employees in the governor’s office called lobbyists to request donations for a political committee aligned with DeSantis as he and First Lady Casey DeSantis hinted that she was considering a run for governor, according to NBC News.
The Senate version, SB 1760, doesn’t include the provision against state employees’ involvement in campaign activities, and needs to go through one more committee before it could be eligible for a floor vote.
Both bills would require university trustees and members of the Board of Governors that oversees public universities to be U.S. citizens and live in Florida, unless they graduated from a state higher education institution.
Mayfield, sponsor of the House bill, won a suit against the Florida Department of State Secretary Cord Byrd, a DeSantis appointee, after Byrd attempted to block Mayfield from appearing on the ballot for a special election in the state Senate district seat she previously held. The Republican representative won the primary for the Brevard County district with 60.81% of the vote on April 1.
The general election is June 10 and Mayfield has resigned from the House effective June 9.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderUniversity System of Georgia Chancellor Sonny Perdue is bemoaning an increase in online classes in the state’s colleges and universities.
“It’s somewhat concerning to me as we look at this trend from post-COVID time over more and more online,” Perdue said at a Board of Regents meeting held at Georgia Southern University Tuesday. “This is really a response to our broader audience, including our presidents in the audience today, to understand if this is driven by faculty or student demand in that regard.”
“I mean, if we continue that, we can become the Western Governors University and not need all the new square footage that’s being requested every year, so that’s just a simple issue,” he added, referring to a private online university.
Perdue was reacting to a presentation on the system’s enrollment for the spring semester that showed an upward creep in online-only classes.
The portion of undergraduates studying completely online was 16% in 2022 after a spike in the aftermath of the pandemic and has since crept up to 19%. The portion of undergrads taking only face-to-face classes meanwhile shrunk from 45% in 2022 to 39% this year.
In all, 42% of undergrads take some classes online and some in person, up from 39% in 2022.
Perdue acknowledged a 2024 university system study that did not show much difference in academic outcomes between online and face-to-face classes for undergraduates, but indicated he does not like the way the trend is moving, asking staff to compile data on how Georgia compares with other states.
In remarks at the end of the public meeting, Perdue also called on university presidents to bring their workforces back onto campus.
“While we had remote work as a privilege for a while, our expectation – my expectation – is when a family, a prospective student or parents or grandparents call the campus on Friday afternoon, they get an answer,” he said.
“We’re in the customer service business,” he added. “And therefore, we are expressing our absolute expectation for our campuses to be covered five days a week – five days a week – that’s Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, all those days for our campuses, and the expectation is of our employees to come back to the campus where the energy happens in that regard, and I hope that we’re going to continue to do that. I hope that we’re going to get good cooperation from our presidents and our campuses everywhere along with that. So if that’s not what you all want, you let me know because that’s where we’re going in that regard.”
There wasn’t too much else for Perdue to bemoan in Tuesday’s enrollment report, which showed steady growth for the system.
Spring 2025 enrollment is 345,823, up 19,400 students or 6% from last spring and an all-time record for the spring semester.
Demographically, the number of white students has steadily dropped, down from 47% in 2021 to 42% today. The number of Black students has remained mostly steady in that time frame, dipping slightly from 26% to 25%.
Hispanic and Asian students have seen the most growth, with the portion of Hispanic students rising from 10% to 12% and Asian students moving from 11% to 14%.
Students in the other category, which includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students, grew 1% to make up 7% of the total population.
In-state enrollment grew by 5%, out of state enrollment by 11% and international by 6.5%.
In-state students make up about 78% of students, out-of-staters comprise just over 14% and the remaining approximately 8% are international students.

Ben Brown, a Republican from Washington, introduces his legislative assistant on the first day of the 2024 Legislative Session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A state senator is taking aim at colleges and universities in Missouri who ask prospective students or job candidates to explain how they would contribute to an institution’s diversity, equity and inclusion goals.
The legislation would prohibit schools from requiring the submission of a diversity, equity and inclusion statement for admission or employment. It would also prohibit the preferential consideration of applicants on the basis of an unsolicited submission of a DEI statement.
According to a guide from Notre Dame University, DEI statements are short essays that describe the candidate’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. Bill sponsor Sen. Ben Brown, a Republican from Washington, called these statements “DEI loyalty oaths” and said they are used as a political litmus test for candidates.
“(Candidates) are expected to commit to shaping their teaching and research priorities around DEI’s radical ideology,” Brown said in a committee hearing on the bill Tuesday.
The University of Missouri does not currently require these types of statements for admission or employment. However, provisions of the bill that deal with “unsolicited statements” could have consequences for MU. The bill would bar universities from giving preferential treatment to applicants for jobs or admission who submit a DEI statement anyway.
“There would have to be proof that someone was given preferential treatment due to the statement that was submitted,” Brown said in an interview. “So absent that evidence, it wouldn’t really have any impact on current practices.”
Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, questioned whether any of these practices were currently taking place at universities in the state. Brown said he hadn’t looked since presenting the bill last year and that many universities, including Missouri State University, could have changed their policies since then. Still, Brown said the legislation is needed regardless of how many schools currently require the submission of DEI statements.
“It is something that has been required,” Brown said, “and I imagine would be in the future as well as things change and something that I feel we need to prevent now.”
Nurrenbern called the bill the “epitome of big government” before concluding her questioning.
James Harris,  testified in favor of the bill on behalf of Cicero Action and Do No Harm Action, a pair of advocacy groups who say on their websites that they oppose “destructive” and “divisive” ideologies. He said requiring DEI statements can force applicants to look for work elsewhere, ultimately harming the state’s colleges and universities.
Critics of the bill included Paul Wagner with the Council on Public Higher Education, which represents Missouri State University, Truman State University and other public colleges in the state. MU is not a member of the council. During his testimony, he called into question the bill’s vague language.
“It just opens (universities) up to so much legal liability on the basis of things that are really just vague and could just be hearsay,” Wagner said. “It puts the state and our institutions at risk.”
Brown said in an interview he was open to the input given during Tuesday’s hearing and would look into tightening the language.

The men were detained at the Salvadoran mega-prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.Despite Boasberg’s order to halt the flights, including returning two planes that were mid-air, immigration officials allowed them to land in El Salvador — and directed a third one to take off.Boasberg wrote Wednesday that the “Government’s actions on that day demonstrate a willful disregard for its Order, sufficient for the Court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt.”“The Court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given Defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory,” continued Boasberg, who was appointed to the bench in 2011 by former President Barack Obama and confirmed unanimously by the Senate.This developing story will be updated.",,,,2025-04-16 14:10:48.968332

Governor Matt Meyer continued the First State tradition on Tuesday afternoon, purchasing the inaugural ticket for the 69th annual DFRC Blue-Gold All★Star Football Game, with DFRC All-Star Buddies, high school Participants, and their families in attendance.
Since its inception, the ticket purchase by Delaware’s sitting Governor has served as a symbolic launch to the DFRC Blue-Gold season. 
Governor Meyer was joined by several key figures from the DFRC Hand-in-Hand Program, including All★Star Buddies JJ (Robert) Justice and Michael Aldas, along with their high school partners Janiah Antonette Thorton, LJ (Juan) Aldas, and Michael Hernandez. Families of the participants, past program members such as Miss Teen Delaware 2024 Kayla Kosmalski, and DFRC staff were also present to mark the occasion.

“DFRC is so grateful that Governor Meyer has continued the long-standing tradition of ceremoniously purchasing the first tickets to the DFRC Blue-Gold All★Star Football Game. It is a wonderful experience for our Buddies and Participants. We are so grateful that he is helping us to support the ABILITIES of all!” said Marie Vacca, DFRC executive director. 
Founded in 1956, DFRC, the Delaware Foundation Reaching Citizens with intellectual disABILITIES, is preparing to celebrate its 70th year of supporting and enriching the lives of Delawareans with intellectual disabilities. Central to this mission is the Hand-in-Hand Program, launched in 1974, which pairs high school Participants (football players, cheerleaders, band members, and student ambassadors) with Buddies ages 4 to 18 who have intellectual disabilities. The program aims to foster connection, empathy, and community awareness across the state.
Participants and Buddies are selected based on their character, community involvement, and dedication to the values of the DFRC program. Each year, high schools from across the state nominate students to represent their school and make meaningful connections with their Buddy throughout the spring leading up to the big game.
The 69th DFRC Blue-Gold All★Star Football Game will be held on Friday, June 20, 2025, at the University of Delaware.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/governor-1-e1744823897694-1024x436.jpg,,,2025-04-16 14:10:48.968332

Jarrod Ousley, Rep. Nikki McDonald and Rep. Valdenia Winn appeared at an April 9, 2025, press conference slamming state and national Republican leadership for cuts to education. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A directive from the U.S. Department of Education immediately froze more than $22 million in federal funding meant to help Kansas students recover from pandemic-era learning loss.
The freeze hasn’t yet reached classrooms, but the state recognizes that could change and is asking officials to give the funds back.
U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon told state education officials across the country in a March 28 letter that any states that received an extension to dole out money from the Education Stabilization Fund, which was a $276 billion federal investment into schools’ COVID-19 recovery efforts, had to stop work immediately.
McMahon said state education departments and recipients of the funds have had “ample time” to use them.
“Extending deadlines for COVID-related grants, which are in fact taxpayer funds, years after the COVID pandemic ended is not consistent with the Department’s priorities and thus not a worthwhile exercise of its discretion,” McMahon wrote.
What exactly the federal department wants has been a shifting target. But the Kansas State Department of Education administration quickly responded, detailing how every dollar of the $22.6 million is meant to be used and how the funds have benefited Kansas children.
The state had “quite a few contracts outstanding” when McMahon sent out her demands, said KSDE’s general counsel, Scott Gordon, at an April 8 Kansas State Board of Education meeting.
KSDE sent the letter to the federal government April 4 explaining the functions of the eight projects that are now on pause and urging reconsideration, which will be on a case-by-case basis.
“The U.S. Department of Education would potentially change their mind a fourth time and allow us to have that extra time that they had already previously approved,” Gordon said.
The state’s letter went through more than 15 drafts, according to Gordon.
“The funds are essential for completing projects that directly address academic development for students,” KSDE’s letter said. “These include statewide literacy and math professional development, assessment systems to students and critical investments in educator and leadership capacity.”
In the meantime, the state told every program using the funds from the extension to stop any activity that would incur further costs.
Jake Steel, the director of strategy and operational alignment in the Kansas education commissioner’s office, said Kansas classrooms haven’t yet been affected, but the longer the feds take to respond, the likelihood that classrooms feel pain increases.
“It will be a big deal if Kansas loses $22.6 million,” Steel said. “That is a huge, huge deal.”
Until that point, he said, it’s a matter of wait and see.
“We’re not trying to make enemies. We’re not trying to use kids as political pawns,” Steel said. “We’re just trying to do what is best for students, and we will respond as requested, and we will fulfill all the laws.”
Support from Kansas’ state and federal lawmakers has followed in kind.
U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt, a Republican, asked the federal department to reinstate the funds in an April 5 social media post. KSDE “was successfully using COVID-19 funding to help our kids catch up from pandemic lockdowns and school closings,” unlike other states, he said in the post.
Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, sent a letter to McMahon on April 9, asking the department to reinstate Kansas’ funds because of how important they have been in restoring learning loss, training educators and lowering child care start-up costs.
“This funding is critical for our schools to continue setting Kansas children up for a strong start to life,” Kelly said.
Kansas is taking a different, more moderate approach than other states in trying to reclaim the funds. Some are refusing to comply with the federal department’s demands. More than a dozen states and the District of Columbia sued the department and McMahon, calling her decision to rescind the funds “arbitrary and capricious.”
In Arizona, a Navajo Nation school district ended reading and math tutoring services and halted repairs to aging infrastructure funded through the stabilization funds, the lawsuit said. In Nevada, 14 employees were laid off. In Michigan, a school district’s HVAC project will have to be abandoned if funds aren’t released. In Maryland, Baltimore City Public Schools canceled tutoring and after-school programs.
In Kansas, almost $7.6 million of the frozen funds have been going toward statewide literacy and math training for educators. About $6.6 million was being used to help schools improve monitoring of student performance. Around $3.6 million was designated for schools to effectively use high-quality instructional materials in classrooms.
About $480,000 was being used to expose students to the full range of career and education options after high school. Spurred by a decline in measures of success after graduation, one project helps students and families explore opportunities outside of a four-year college path.
“A consequence of the learning loss created by the pandemic has been a decrease in the number of students, particularly males, pursuing postsecondary education,” KSDE’s letter said. “It is imperative to address this decline in postsecondary pursuits to ensure students have a path forward to earning a livable wage and Kansas can fulfill its workforce demand.”
The state’s letter to McMahon similarly justified each project’s funding.
Roughly $230,000 of the frozen funds were for principal and superintendent leadership development across the state. Nearly $2.3 million has been used to support child care and early childhood education. And almost $670,000 was being used for administrative and oversight costs within the state department.
KSDE secured in 2024 a late liquidation period for the education stabilization funds, which would have allowed the state’s contractors until March 28, 2026, to spend the money. Every dollar necessary to carry out the state’s plan was designated to a project or contractor before Sept. 30.
The deadline extension, which the federal department approved Sept. 10, has allowed the state to continue paying contractors to carry out the eight projects the funds have supported.
Kansas House Democrats in a Thursday press conference, slammed the Trump administration and the state’s Republican majority for shortchanging public education funding.
Rep. Nikki McDonald, an Olathe Democrat, said the federal funding was a lifeline for students, helping them regain lost ground.
“Yet another promise to our children has been broken,” she said. It’s just the latest instance of dishonoring commitments made to our children.”
Expressing concern for gaps in literacy rates and dwindling workforce readiness, Rep. Valdenia Winn, a Kansas City Democrat, said investing in education is urgent, particularly to address socioeconomic disparities. The number of students reading below a basic level has steadily increased since before the pandemic and has yet to course correct.
“This issue does not discriminate,” Winn said.
The federal education funding freeze has caused uncertainty and concern for the students’ futures. State Democrats expressed particular concern toward Republican efforts to strip funding from state literacy initiatives and a push to elect state supreme court justices. Republicans have supermajorities in both chambers to push their agenda.
McDonald later told Kansas Reflector: “Sometimes I think maybe chaos is the point.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4090171-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-16 13:15:30.549333

The measure is one of two regarding regulation of hemp-derived THC products sponsored by Panhandle Republican Michelle Salzman that were approved unanimously in the House Budget Committee. The main bill (HB 7027) is a companion to […],"Hemp being grown indoors for flower to produce CBD oil. (Florida A&M University hemp pilot project report to Florida Senate Agriculture Committee)All hemp-derived THC products would be taxed at 15% under a proposal passed in a Florida House committee on Wednesday.
The measure is one of two regarding regulation of hemp-derived THC products sponsored by Panhandle Republican Michelle Salzman that were approved unanimously in the House Budget Committee.
The main bill (HB 7027) is a companion to a Senate bill (SB 438) that has already passed unanimously in that chamber, although they do contain significant differences. Among them is that Salzman’s bill would not ban Delta-8, the hemp-derived THC product that has grown in popularity since hemp was legalized in the United States through the 2018 U.S. farm bill.
Like its Senate companion, the House bill limits the amount of Delta-9 hemp-derived products such as beverages and gummies. It says edibles must contain no more than 2 milligrams; be individually wrapped; and be sold in containers with no more than 20 edibles.
That raised objections from Patrick Shatzer of Sunmed/Your CBD Store, who says his company is the largest CBD brick-and-mortar business in the country with 260 locations nationwide and 42 in Florida.
“The size of the gummies — limited to 2 grams — that’s just a tiny little pinkie size wide,” he said to the committee. “That’s not the industry standard. The industry standard is anywhere from 5 to 8 grams.”
Shatzer also objected to the provision limiting 20 servings per container, saying the average dietary supplements permit 30 gummies in a container. And he raised objections to a prohibition on selling, delivering, bartering, giving, or furnishing hemp consumables that total more than 100 milligrams of THC to a person in a 24-hour period, saying it would be unenforceable.
Rep. Salzman replied that, while she is open to changing some of those limits, she is holding firm on limiting personal consumption of such products to 100 milligrams of THC a day.
“If somebody know that they can’t buy more than 100 milligrams in that day, it’s going to give them a warning subconsciously, ‘Maybe I shouldn’t have more than 100 milligrams of this stuff in a day,'” she said. “And if you want more than 100 milligrams of this stuff a day, you  probably need to get a medical cannabis card.”
Regarding the proposed 15% excise tax on hemp products, Jodi James of the Florida Cannabis Action Network said that not all hemp products are intoxicating, and that those that aren’t should not be taxed at all.
“In the state of Florida, we don’t tax vitamins, we don’t tax supplements,” she said. 
Salzman said following the meeting that she will exempt those products before the bill’s final hearing before House Commerce Committee next week. 
“That’s a no-brainer,” she said. “The purpose of this is to give it a sin-tax, and if you’re not using it for sin, then yes.”
Money for testing
The measure says that the first $6 million of revenue collected from the tax would go into a General Inspection Trust fund for enforcement and testing of hemp-derived products. The rest would go into the state’s main account, the General Revenue Fund.
Atlhough the House and Senate bills differ in some respects, one similarity that members of the committee voiced concerns about was a requirement that hemp-containing beverages be sold only through shops licensed to sell alcoholic beverages.
“I don’t think that we should be picking winners and losers here,” said Naples Republican Rep. Lauren Melo. “I, too, would like to see convenience stores added back in.”
“I, too, think it should be treated like alcohol,” added Broward County Democratic Rep. Christine Hunschofsky. “And therefore should be available in the same way that alcohol is.”
Southeast Florida Republican Rep. Toby Overdorf said he would like to see more work regarding synthetics, which are not listed in the House measure.
Much is the same in the House and Senate bills; both would prohibit packaging that might be attractive to children and require the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs to certify any hemp-testing laboratory in Florida or any other state.
The House bill prohibits THC products from being sold, given, bartered, furnished, or delivered to consumers at festivals, fairs, trade shows, farmers’ markets, expositions, or pop-up retail establishments. And it would ban anyone from ingesting them within 1,000 feet of a public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school between the hours of 6 a.m. and midnight.
The bill will move to the Commerce Committee next week, its likely final stop before reaching the floor.

Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit Wednesday, saying the tariffs hurt “states, consumers and businesses.”","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit Wednesday, saying the tariffs hurt “states, consumers and businesses.”


With the state budget hanging precariously in the balance, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced today that California will sue to block President Donald Trump’s tariff powers.
The lawsuit, which Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta plan to file in federal court this morning, argues that Trump does not have the constitutional authority to unilaterally enact tariffs. Trump cited the United States’ large trade deficit to declare a national emergency earlier this month and impose sweeping tariffs on the rest of the world.
“President Trump’s unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on California families, businesses, and our economy — driving up prices and threatening jobs,” Newsom said in a statement. “We’re standing up for American families who can’t afford to let the chaos continue.”
In a matter of days in early April, Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to establish a universal 10% tariff on all countries importing goods to the United States, with even higher reciprocal tariffs on some nations, then abruptly reversed course hours after they took effect, pausing most of the reciprocal tariffs while ratcheting up the import tax on China to 145%.
The chaos tanked the stock market, a huge risk for California’s forthcoming budget, which depends disproportionately on income tax revenue from capital gains earned by the wealthiest taxpayers. The state is also particularly vulnerable to other economic pain from the tariffs, because China is California’s largest trading partner, propping up manufacturing, agriculture, tourism and major ports in Los Angeles, Long Beach and Oakland.
Other major potential impacts for California include driving up the cost of construction materials just as Los Angeles begins rebuilding from a series of devastating fires that flattened several neighborhoods in January.
In their lawsuit, to be filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Newsom and Bonta will ask a judge to immediately pause Trump’s tariffs.
The state contends that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act specifies many remedies a president can take in response to a foreign economic threat, but tariffs are not among them. Without this specific authorization from Congress, the lawsuit will argue, Trump’s actions are “unlawful and unprecedented.”
“The President’s chaotic and haphazard implementation of tariffs is not only deeply troubling, it’s illegal,” Bonta said in a statement. “As the fifth largest economy in the world, California understands global trade policy is not just a game.”
The lawsuit continues Newsom’s shift back toward a more aggressively confrontational stance against the Trump administration. After the Los Angeles wildfires, the governor sought to reset his relationship with Trump as he lobbied for federal disaster aid.But even though Congress has yet to approve any further assistance for Los Angeles, Newsom has begun more vocally opposing the president’s economic policies in recent weeks. In the wake of Trump’s tariffs announcement earlier this month, Newsom said California would pursue its own “strategic partnerships” on international trade.

(Photo: Lisa Sorg)The North Carolina House Agriculture and Environment Committee voted to approve a flurry of bills on Wednesday, touching on topics like wastewater and PFAS.
Rep. Mark Brody (R-Anson, Union) introduced House Bill 376, titled “Various On-Site Wastewater & Well Provisions.” The legislation would subject drinking wells and wastewater to rules and regulations determined by the state.
The bill would create the North Carolina On-Site Wastewater Contractors and Inspectors Certification Board, to consist of nine members appointed to three-year terms. This body would shoulder the responsibility to evaluate and approve on-site wastewater systems.
Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) asked for the reasoning behind the legislation and the push for uniform rules.
Brody explained that well drillers perform their duties in different counties across the state.
“We’re trying to get the same rules for everybody, so they don’t go to different counties with different rules,” he said.
For wastewater, under current law, if the county evaluates and makes a mistake, the state will absorb some of the costs of fines or repairs as long as the county follows state rules. If the county does not, they are on their own to finance any additional costs.
Harrison said she would vote against the bill, as she thought the jurisdiction should remain with local governments. With such varied topography across North Carolina, a one-size-fits-all model may not be the best.
“You have situations where you’ve got mountainous terrain, you’ve got coastal which is high water tables, areas prone to flooding it seems you might want to have it more narrowly tailored to local governments,” she said.
The bill moves forward to the House Rules Committee.
The panel also advanced House Bill 569, titled “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” a measure meant to protect North Carolinians from drinking water contaminated by PFAS — per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or “forever chemicals” that are dangerous to the environment.
HB 569 outlines the permissible concentration levels of PFAS that are established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
“It addresses the PFAs contamination that is put into a water source that goes into a public utility,” sponsor Rep. Ted Davis (R-New Hanover) said.
With a favorable vote, the measure heads to the House Rules Committee.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cape-fear-3-sized-1024x749.jpg,,,2025-04-16 13:15:30.549333

Maile Carter served as the director of emergency medical services in Eldridge from March 2020 through August 2023. In her recently filed lawsuit against the city, she alleges that at the beginning of her employment, City Clerk Chandra Kyte informed her she did not need to track her hours because she would be a salaried employee and exempt from overtime pay, so her timecard should always show 40 hours worked regardless of her actual hours.
Carter alleges that she was on call, responding to emergency calls, or on the work schedule, nearly all week, every week, to ensure that there was adequate coverage for emergency response teams. She alleges she was never “off the clock,” always had her pager on, and was required to restrict her movements to a limited geographic area so she could respond immediately to emergency calls.
She left her job with the city in August 2023 and alleges that in June 2024 she discovered the city had misclassified her and other city employees as salaried employees, rather than hourly employees eligible for overtime pay.
According to the lawsuit, Carter then worked with the city’s mayor pro tem and the head of the city’s finance committee, Carey Callaway Morton, to determine her actual hours worked. They allegedly determined Carter was owed, conservatively, at least $95,000 in unpaid wages.
At around that same time, the city council allegedly acknowledged it had failed to pay its current chief of police and Carter’s successor as EMS director overtime dating back to June 2022. The two were awarded lump sum payouts of $35,569 and $12,557, respectively.
Despite that, the lawsuit claims, the city has refused to approve the payment of overtime for Carter. According to the lawsuit, the city doesn’t deny it owes Carter unpaid wages but has placed the burden of proving the hours worked on Cater.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, seeks unspecified damages for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Iowa Wage Payment Collection Law.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate committee Wednesday approved a bill that would require school boards to adopt policies on whether to allow students to leave school for religious study and give them academic credit for it.
SB 278, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, mirrors HB 342, sponsored by Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, which was rejected by the House Education Committee on April 2. The state already has a law that allows school boards to adopt such policies, known as Released Time Religious Instruction (RTRI). The bill would mandate the development of those policies.

The committee heard from critics and supporters of the legislation last week. 
“The bill is designed to provide local control and flexibility, ensuring a district can implement policies that best suit their needs, while respecting the constitutional rights of students and parents,” Shelnutt said Wednesday.
The senator said the policy could forbid RTRI. 
“Yes, local boards have the ability to adopt their own policies,” he said. “If the policy they implement is super narrow because this does not work in their district in any way, then so be it.”
Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, echoed a concern raised by Dale County Superintendent Ben Baker last week that there is not enough time in the school day for students to leave campus for RTRI. He said religious instruction should happen at home. 
 “This is kind of boilerplate legislation, in my view. At some point we have to give parents the responsibility we say parents should have in terms of how they go about the process of sharing moral values with their kids,” Hatcher said. “In fact, I know that it should begin at home.”
Hatcher also questioned the intent of the bill. Although the legislation says that any religious group can participate, Hatcher was concerned about what that would look like and if it would happen.
“I do know that there’s a slippery slope to this kind of legislation,” he said. “I do know that a part of the intent of legislation like this has a great deal to do with this notion of Christian nationalism.”
Sen. Roger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, raised concerns over liability. He said that students could sign up for the program, leave the school and not attend the program.
“We don’t have control over them but they’re still under us, but we don’t have control. That’s an hour that is returned outside during the hours of eight to three,” Smitherman said.
Shelnutt said the groups that host RTRI, like LifeWise Ministry, will assume all liability. According to LifeWise’s sample curriculum, it teaches the Christian belief that “God created all things good” to a list of virtues that the nonprofit describes as “LifeWise qualities.”
At least 30 school board representatives from across the state attended Wednesday’s meeting. Sally Smith, executive director of the Alabama Association of School Boards, said she is disappointed the legislation passed, but would continue to have conversations with lawmakers. Smith has consistently expressed concern and opposition to the bill.
“We think that we just have to have continued conversations with our senators due to local leaders’ concerns with this bill,” Smith said in an interview. “It is in the area of making policy that presents constitutional challenges to local boards of education. So it is not as clearly clean cut as some may think.”
The bill was approved 8-1 with Hatcher as the only member that voted against the bill. Smitherman said he only voted for it to get it out of committee, but that it still needed significant work. Shelnutt said he would work with Smitherman on his concerns.
“I’m going to vote to get the bill out of committee, but I do think that before we move that bill on the floor, that these things have got to be tightened up,” Smitherman said.
The bill moves to the full Senate.

Avelo Airlines CEO Andrew Levy offered that advice in a one-page letter he sent to state Attorney General William Tong Tuesday.
“A copy of the relevant federal contract can be obtained from the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request,” Levy wrote to the state’s attorney general.
He continued: ​“Consequently, questions regarding the contract’s scope of work, including passenger ages, flight origins, DHS communications with the courts, passenger restraint protocols, and instructions provided to contractors should be directed to DHS, which oversees and enforces all relevant immigration matters.”
Levy’s letter comes a week after Tong sent Avelo a public letter of his own slamming the airline for agreeing to run deportation flights for the Trump administration out of a new base in Arizona starting this May.
Avelo’s deportation contract has sparked public condemnations from Tong, Mayor Justin Elicker, the Board of Alders, and New Haven State Sen. and President Pro Tem Martin Looney. It’s also inspired a protest at Tweed and a grassroots online boycott that has now surpassed 32,800 signatures.
[RELATED: CT lawmakers seek to restrict Avelo Airlines from contracting with ICE]
At the top of the list of questions in Tong’s April 8 letter to Levy was a request to see a copy of Avelo’s contract with DHS. He also asked the airline to confirm that it won’t operate deportation flights from any Connecticut airport and that it will never operate flights with shackled children.
Tong gave Avelo a week to respond.
Sure enough, on Tuesday, Levy sent a letter to Tong. 
In addition to stating that the DHS contract is available via a FOIA request, Levy wrote to the attorney general that ​“we do believe from the tone of your letter that there is a fundamental misunderstanding how the federal government contracts the flights that are the subject of your letter.”
Tong linked to Levy’s letter in a follow-up press release sent on Tuesday in which he made clear his dissatisfaction with Levy’s response.
“Today’s response from Avelo is totally unacceptable because it contains no response at all,” Tong is quoted as saying in Tuesday’s press release. ​“Their overly legalistic and technical letter is insulting and condescending to the people of Connecticut who have invested in and committed millions of dollars to Avelo’s success. What’s more, telling the Office of the Attorney General to pound sand and to ask the Department of Homeland Security for a copy of their contract through FOIA is a callous back-of-the-hand that shows they really don’t care what we think. It is clear all they intend to do is take state support and make money off other people’s suffering.”
Avelo flies more than two dozen direct routes out of Tweed after making New Haven its East Coast hub in November 2021. The airline is also the beneficiary of a state aviation fuel tax break.
In public statements, Avelo Airlines CEO Andrew Levy has defended the deportation-flight contract as providing Avelo with some protection from ​“fluctuating fuel prices” and other ​“macroeconomic factors,” all in service of allowing the company to ​“grow our core business, which is scheduled passenger travel.”
An internal-company email Levy sent out on April 3 justified the deportation-flight contract as helping offset Avelo’s growing financial troubles at Tweed amid a steep increase in passenger-travel competition. 
A Tweed spokesperson has consistently dismissed this claim as ​“bizarre and untrue,” citing how Tweed’s ​“exceptional performance has helped power Avelo’s national expansion, as they have since expanded into new or slower-performing markets, all while Tweed continues to shatter previous records.”

(Getty image)Another federal judge has demanded the Trump administration release federal funds awarded to environmental nonprofits but unavailable for some or all of the last three months.
Judge Mary McElroy of the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island on Tuesday ordered federal agencies to resume payments of federal grants already awarded from a pair of Biden-era Congressional spending packages. The 63-page ruling also prevents named federal agencies and cabinet members from pausing future payments based on Trump’s Jan. 20 “Unleashing American Energy” executive order or future orders with similar intent. 
“Agencies do not have unlimited authority to further a President’s agenda, nor do they have unfettered power to hamstring in perpetuity two statutes passed by Congress during the previous administration,” McElroy wrote.
The order does not end the case, but seeks to resolve short-term harms of frozen funds as the court process continues. 
Other federal judges, including in Rhode Island, have reached similar conclusions in response to the flurry of lawsuits prompted by the abrupt halt of federal grants and aid since Trump took office. 
This case pertains specifically to funds appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and already awarded to nonprofit recipients. Six environmental and health-related nonprofit groups, including three in Rhode Island, filed the federal complaint on March 14. The lawsuit alleges the frozen grant payments forced nonprofits to halt projects already underway, suspend hiring and contemplate layoffs, according to court documents.


Plaintiffs 
Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council
Eastern Rhode Island Conservation District
Childhood Lead Action Project, of Rhode Island
Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation, of Massachusetts
Green Infrastructure Center, of Virginia
National Council of Nonprofits, based in D.C.
Defendants 
Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins
Department of Energy and Secretary Chris Wright
Department of the Interior and Secretary Doug Bergum
Environmental Protection Agency and Administrator Lee Zeldin
Department of Housing and Urban Development and Secretary Scott Turner 
Office of Management and Budget and Director Russell Vought
National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett 


McElroy concurred.
“The Nonprofits were left adrift as they scrambled to make sense of the Government’s actions here,” she wrote. “The pause placed critical climate, housing, and infrastructure projects in serious jeopardy, while also threatening the livelihoods of the Nonprofits’ employees as well as their fundamental missions.”
By contrast, “the Government is not harmed where an order requires them to disburse funds that Congress has appropriated and that Agencies have already awarded.”
Further damage to nonprofits’ work, including childhood lead poisoning prevention, tree planting, and local composting programs, was laid out in more detail during a three-hour hearing in McElroy’s Providence courtroom on April 3.
Attorneys representing the nonprofits, which include Rhode Island’s Childhood Lead Action Project, the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council and Eastern Rhode Island Conservation District, argued the inconsistent access to federal grants violated constitutional provisions separating powers of federal government, with devastating consequences for the nonprofits identified in the lawsuit and hundreds of others nationwide.
Computer code holds the key? 
Daniel Schwei, the U.S. Department of Justice attorney representing the Trump administration and named federal agencies, countered in written and oral arguments that there was never a sweeping freeze on federal funds, simply a selective pause and review, which was within federal agencies’ powers to initiate.
McElroy rejected the administration’s arguments.
“Record evidence makes the Government’s feigned confusion on this point particularly puzzling,” she wrote. “When one grantee logged onto the [federal] portal, for instance, the code for the pause to their funds was “IRA/BIL Hold,” abbreviations for the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or “BIL”). How difficult could it really be for the Government to figure out which actions are challenged if there is already a specific computer code for these universal pauses?”
She later invoked part of an order from Rhode Island Chief Judge John McConnell Jr. in a parallel funding freeze case filed by 23 Democratic state attorneys general.
“Rather than taking a deliberate, thoughtful approach to finding these alleged unsubstantiated ‘wasteful or fraudulent expenditures,’ the Defendants abruptly froze billions of dollars of federal funding for an indefinite period. It is difficult to perceive any rationality in this decision—let alone thoughtful consideration of practical consequences,” McConnell wrote in his March 6 order requiring federal agencies to release federal grants and aid to state governments.










The Nonprofits were left adrift as they scrambled to make sense of the Government’s actions here. The pause placed critical climate, housing, and infrastructure projects in serious jeopardy, while also threatening the livelihoods of the Nonprofits’ employees as well as their fundamental missions.


– Judge Mary McElroy of the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island 


Federal judges in D.C., Massachusetts and California, among others, have come to similar conclusions in separate lawsuits challenging frozen federal funds for affected groups.
McElroy acknowledged in her order the limits of the court’s power over the executive branch.
“The Court wants to be crystal clear: elections have consequences and the President is entitled to enact his agenda,” she wrote. “The judiciary does not and cannot decide whether his policies are sound.”
She continued, “But where the federal courts are constitutionally required to weigh in—meaning we, by law, have no choice but to do so—are cases ‘about the procedure’ (or lack thereof) that the Government follows in trying to enact those policies.”

While Schwei sought to limit the scope of the proposed court order only to the nonprofits named in the case, McElroy granted the plaintiffs’ request to apply her ruling more broadly based on the likely consequences for other grant recipients not named in the case.
“It would be anathema to reasonable jurisprudence that only the named Nonprofits should be protected from the irreparable harms of the likely unlawful agency actions,” she wrote. 
Skye Perryman, CEO of D.C.-based Democracy Forward, which is representing the nonprofits in the case, called McElroy’s ruling a “crucial victory.” 
“We are pleased that a federal court has seen the Trump administration’s freeze of congressionally approved funds for what it is: another abuse of executive power that has already inflicted harm on communities nationwide,” Perryman said in a statement Tuesday. “By blocking these investments in local communities and projects, the administration is jeopardizing public health initiatives, environmental protections, and economic stability.”
Providence attorney Miriam Weizenbaum, who served as the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General’s Civil Division Chief until April 2024, is also representing the nonprofits in the case.
Matthew Nies, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment when reached by email Wednesday. 
McElroy’s order requires all federal agencies and directors named in the case to submit written updates on their compliance with her mandate no later than 5 p.m. Wednesday.

It's time to challenge outdated myths.,"In a society where narrow beauty standards dominate, feeling confident and empowered in your own appearance can be challenging—especially for those whom society often overlooks, such as women with disabilities. These women frequently face deep-seated stigma rooted in harmful stereotypes, societal misconceptions, and exclusionary narratives. While media representation has made strides in including more women with disabilities and challenging outdated myths, there is still much progress to be made to reshape how we think about beauty and disability, particularly in academic and professional spaces. 
The Bold Beauty Project is a powerful visual arts exhibition that celebrates women with a wide range of disabilities. Through large-scale portraits paired with deeply personal narratives, the project offers an intimate, striking exploration of what it means to be a woman with a disability. The Miami based non-profit was founded by disability rights advocate Shelly Baer, LCSW and Dr. Eva Ritvo, M.D., joined as co-director  in 2015. The project’s mission for over 10 years has been to create “social change by utilizing art at the intersection of beauty and disability” and they have created shows around the US and in Panama.

In 2022, along with Karamot Adeola and Evie Strauss, I helped launch The Bold Beauty Project: University Edition—the first-ever collegiate version of the Bold Beauty Project. This student-led initiative brought together undergraduate and graduate women from both the University of Miami and Florida International University, featuring models with both visible and invisible disabilities. 
The experience of directing the Bold Beauty Project in 2022 had a profound impact on me. In 2023, I began my Masters of Public Health Degree at the Yale School of Public Health to delve deeper into the study of health and well-being.  I found myself reflecting on the work I had done with the Bold Beauty Project as an undergraduate, and I knew I wanted to bring this transformative initiative to Yale. After sharing the idea with Dr. Ritvo, I was met with unwavering encouragement and support. 
In fall 2024, I reached out to the executive board of Disability Empowerment in Public Health at Yale (DEPHY)—a cross-disability community of graduate students who identify as disabled, neurodivergent, chronically ill, or living with mental health conditions, as well as allies—to collaborate on bringing this vision to life. Together, we began recruiting models and photographers to develop what would become the Bold Beauty Project: Yale Edition. 
Throughout the spring semester, I’ve worked closely with our lead photographer, model coordinator, and DEPHY executive leadership team to create an immersive, visual-audio exhibition that celebrates the strength, resilience, and beauty of Yale-affiliated women living with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Featuring the work of student photographers, the exhibit will spotlight powerful portraits accompanied by written and audio narratives, offering a deeply personal window into each model and photographer’s story, inspiration, and relationship with beauty. Our goal is to use storytelling and art to redefine beauty, challenge assumptions, and broaden the narrative surrounding disability. We hope you will join us.  
The Bold Beauty Project: Yale Edition will debut as a one-night-only event on Friday, April 18, 2025, from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM at the Yale Program for Recovery and Community Health.

WINSTON-SALEM—Perhaps it was rain dripping through one of the many holes in the roof that condensed the ammonium nitrate into a potentially explosive cake.
Or maybe it was an electrical short, like the one that had occurred a month earlier, igniting a pile of fertilizer.
Regardless of the cause, on the evening of Jan. 31, 2022, the Winston Weaver fertilizer plant caught fire.
For the first two hours of a week-long siege, Winston-Salem firefighters inundated the plant with more than a half million gallons of water as they furiously tried to prevent 600 tons of ammonium nitrate—stored in wooden buildings and a rail car near a residential area—from exploding.
Meanwhile, contractors hired by Winston Weaver built a berm to contain the fire water runoff and prevent it from entering a nearby creek, according to fire officials. And for good reason: The runoff—shipped to a dairy as “off spec liquid fertilizer” and spread on fields—was later found to contain a goulash of dozens of chemicals, including toxic PFAS.
The shipment and application of the off spec fertilizer between Winston Weaver and Shady Grove Dairy has not been previously reported.
Winston Weaver’s off spec fertilizer differed from sewage sludge in that it hadn’t passed through a treatment plant. But even if the material had been treated, PFAS would not have been removed without an advanced and expensive system.
When PFAS-contaminated sewage sludge is applied to farmland, it can contaminate the soil, groundwater, drinking water supplies and food. The connection between sewage sludge and environmental contamination prompted the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality to conduct a state-wide sludge survey. The agency plans to publish the results later this year, according to a DEQ.
A week before President Trump was inaugurated for a second term, the EPA published a draft risk assessment of the potential human health risks associated with PFAS in sewage sludge. The agency emphasized that people who live on PFAS-contaminated farms are at higher risk because they eat and drink what they grow.
It’s unclear how the sludge rules will fare under the Trump administration.

Many chemical industry and manufacturing trade associations oppose further restrictions on PFAS. In mid-February, 19 trade groups led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin with a wish list of PFAS rollbacks, citing what they view as the economic necessity of the compounds and the billions of dollars in cleanup costs.
The letter doesn’t specifically mention sewage sludge but it does call for a review of drinking water standards and the reclassification of PFOS and PFOA from hazardous to non-hazardous substances.
“We stand ready to work with you on these important issues,” the letter reads.
Winston Weaver contractor determined “off spec liquid fertilizer” not hazardous
After the fire at Winston Weaver, the Winston-Salem fire Department told DEQ it did not use firefighting foam that contained PFAS to fight the fire at the fertilizer plant. The source of the contamination is still unknown.
Winston Weaver shipped the fire water runoff in steel tanks to Shady Grove Dairy 20 miles away in East Bend. The farm had agreed to take the “off spec liquid fertilizer,” according to an agreement provided to Inside Climate News by state regulators. It was later spread on a field planted with corn silage to feed the cows.
Off spec liquid fertilizer is defined by state regulators as “a product that does not meet quality specifications or standards.”




PFAS are everywhere
There are tens of thousands of types of PFAS, which are found in many consumer products,as well as water-resistant clothing, furniture and personal care products. The compounds are ubiquitous, contaminating air, drinking water, fish, soil, crops, eggs and milk worldwide. PFAS even contribute to climate change by disrupting the ocean cycle and increasing the emissions of greenhouse gases.
PFAS exposure can lead to myriad serious health conditions, including kidney and testicular cancer, thyroid disorders, reproductive problems, high cholesterol and a depressed immune system.




Shady Grove Dairy owner Tim Smitherman did not respond to emails requesting an interview. Calls for two phone numbers listed in state records for Smitherman did not go through. Former Winston Weaver plant manager Adam Parrish did not respond to emails and a phone message.
When DEQ learned of the agreement between Shady Grove and Winston Weaver, it required sampling of the material to determine whether it would be considered hazardous before allowing it to be shipped, DEQ spokesman Josh Kastrinsky said. Consultants for Winston Weaver analyzed the data and determined it was not hazardous and could be shipped.
After consulting with the EPA, DEQ also required sampling the off spec fertilizer for the compounds.
Without a legal basis to stop the transfer and use of the off spec fertilizer at Shady Grove, the EPA and the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality approved it, state records show.
At the time of the fire, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was still two years from establishing drinking water standards for any PFAS compounds, but had established a drinking water advisory of 70 ppt. Lab samples from the consultant indicated that the highest combined levels in the land-applied water of PFOA and PFOS were below 11 ppt.










“Regardless of whether or not there were PFAS in the water, it came from a fire at a manufacturing facility. It seems like there would have been other ways to dispose of it.”


– Jamie DeWitt, toxicologist


That level is now nearly three times the EPA’s drinking water standard.
There are no federal or state rules for PFAS in sewage sludge or the off spec fertilizer bound for farm fields.
More than 66,000 tons of dried sewage sludge was applied on North Carolina’s farm fields for use as fertilizer in 2023, according to state data. As scientists have learned more about how PFAS moves within the environment, they have focused on the compounds’ presence in sewage sludge because of its potential to contaminate the food supply.
“Certain things shouldn’t be applied to the land,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist who specializes in PFAS research and is a member of DEQ’s Secretaries’ Science Advisory Board. “Regardless of whether or not there were PFAS in the water, it came from a fire at a manufacturing facility. It seems like there would have been other ways to dispose of it.”
EPA’s draft evaluation for PFAS in sludge “recklessly underestimates the harm”
In cities, wastewater from homes, businesses and industries discharges to treatment plants, where it becomes sewage sludge that is usually trucked to landfills, incinerated or spread on farm fields. Eighty percent of the 50 largest wastewater treatment plants in the U.S. reported detectable levels of PFAS, according to a 2020 EPA study. The contamination primarily comes from industrial sources that don’t remove the compounds from wastewater before sending it to the plants.
PFAS are also present in some consumer products, and could enter wastewater treatment plants through washing machines, sinks and toilets.
Nationwide, the material has been used on 70 million acres of farmland, sometimes with serious consequences, according to the Environmental Working Group. In Maine, dairy cows that grazed on contaminated fields produced milk with high levels of PFAS, prompting farmers to withdraw their product from the marketplace.
Officials in Johnson County, Texas, declared a state of disaster in February because of PFAS-contaminated agricultural land, soil, groundwater, surface water and animal tissue. In North Carolina, the compounds have been detected in compost.
The EPA’s draft risk assessment for sewage sludge found human health risks exceeded acceptable thresholds when it contained 1 part per billion of PFOA or PFOS, two of the most toxic types.
The off spec fertilizer at Shady Grove contained levels of PFOA and PFOS below the EPA’s threshold of 1 part per billion, published in the draft risk assessment. However it also contained eight to 16 types of the compounds, state records show, depending on which tank was sampled.
The assessment also concludes children who live on dairy farms and drink one to two glasses of milk per day have a significantly higher risk of developing cancer later in life. Their risk of developing non-cancer health effects is also 34 times higher just from that milk than what is considered safe. Adults also face health risks.
People whose drinking water comes from sources on or near farmland polluted with PFAS are also at higher risk of developing cancer or other serious illnesses, according to the draft risk assessment.
State records show that there are several private drinking water wells near Shady Grove Dairy, and there is one on the farm itself. Roughly 1,600 feet from the nearest barn runs a stream that feeds tributaries to the Yadkin River, the drinking water supply for more than 800,000 people.
The EPA still lowballed the threat, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center attorneys Jean Zhuang and Hannah Nelson, who provided public comments on the draft risk assessment.
First, the EPA considered only two PFAS compounds: PFOA and PFOS, “when nearly 15,000 PFAS chemicals plague our environment, surface water, and groundwater,” the attorneys wrote.
Nor did the draft risk assessment account for the combined risk of multiple PFAS or the other sources of the contaminants—clothing, some cookware and consumer products.
“The assessment recklessly underestimates the harm that PFAS-polluted sludge causes to farming families—it must be amended to reflect reality. Sludge is far more polluted than the assessment assumes,” the attorneys wrote.
They also asked the EPA to require industries to pre-treat for PFAS to prevent the compounds from entering the wastewater plants and contaminating the sludge.
“Many of these families unknowingly spread contaminated sludge on their lands because they were told that it was a safe and effective way to fertilize their farms,” the SELC wrote. “Their children and family members are the ones eating the vegetables, beef, fish, fruit, milk, and eggs from their farms. Their families are the ones that have the most to lose.”
Farm has history of violations
The 1,200 cows and calves at Shady Grove Dairy outnumber the people who live in East Bend, in Yadkin County. Over the past decade, state regulators have fined the dairy more than $22,000 for several violations, including allowing cow manure to drain from a waste lagoon into a nearby creek.
The state also cited Shady Grove Dairy in connection with the off spec fertilizer, but not because it contained PFAS. Since the material originated at a fertilizer plant, levels of nitrogen, ammonia and phosphorus were astronomical. DEQ advised farmer Sterling Smitherman against over-applying the fire water runoff, documents show. The agency provided calculations to guide him on the proper application rates, Kastrinsky told Inside Climate News.
Yet when a DEQ inspector visited Shady Grove, unannounced, in March 2022, she found “severe and significant” damage to the silage field from too much nitrogen, state records show. DEQ officials later determined Smitherman “willfully” overapplied the fire water runoff and fined the farm $2,400.
Even though DEQ determined the nitrogen overload “likely” impacted groundwater and surface water immediately after the off spec fertilizer was applied, the agency did not test those areas for PFAS.
“Because the levels present were not in violation of any standards, staff did not conduct follow-up testing on surface water, land or groundwater near the site of application,” Kastrinsky said.
Those compounds could still be on the farm. “Once PFAS get onto the land, they have the potential to stay there for decades, maybe even centuries,” DeWitt said. “They have the potential to move off of that land into air and into water and get transported to other other areas, to broaden contamination and to potentially increase exposures to people living nearby that area of the land application.”
NCDA spokeswoman Andrea Ashby said DEQ did not notify agriculture department officials about the off spec fertilizer; however, Kastrinsky countered that representatives from both agencies discussed the situation.
The state Agriculture Department has not tested any dairy farms for PFAS in milk, Ashby said, because it has not received guidance from the FDA to do so. “The Department’s Food and Drug Protection lab is not set up to test for PFAS or other related chemicals as there is no science-based guidance or established standards at this time to follow for food products.”
PFAS has been detected in gardens in North Carolina. Academic scientists at several state universities tested five residential gardens near the Chemours plant in Fayetteville, a known area of contamination. One type of PFAS compound, GenX, was detected in 72 percent of the 53 samples. Crops containing higher amounts of water had higher amounts of GenX.
The FDA has made progress on testing PFAS in the food supply, according to the agency website. In February, the FDA blocked the import of canned clams from China because of elevated PFAS levels. The agency also has a valid testing method and helps states analyze foods grown, raised, or processed in known areas of contamination before they go to market.
Glenda Pereira is an assistant professor of animal science and a dairy specialist at the University of Maine. She said scientists are studying how PFAS are transferred to crops from soil or irrigation. Unpublished research results from Maine show corn silage tends to have lower levels of PFAS compared with grasses and hay.
“But if the levels in the soil are high enough, the levels in corn silage could be a concern,” Pereira said.
Pereira recommended that farmers who applied PFAS-contaminated sewage sludge on their fields test their soil. The science is still emerging on testing methods, but Maine has published PFOS soil screening levels for several crops as they’re related to dairies and milk production.
Three years after the Winston Weaver fire, the plant has been razed. DEQ reported that subsequent sampling showed the soil contained high levels of arsenic; groundwater had elevated concentrations of several chemicals, including nitrite, nitrate, and benzene—the latter of which is a known carcinogen.
The cause of the fire remains undetermined. State labor department officials fined Winston Weaver $5,600 for violations that could have contributed to the blaze.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Weaver-Fertilizer-fire-WS-Fire-Dept-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 13:15:30.549333

Jay Gallé, R-Mandeville, said to the House Civil Law Committee while presenting one of six so-called […]","Getty ImagesHouse lawmakers advanced six bills targeting personal injury lawsuits Tuesday in the opening salvo of the Louisiana Legislature’s ongoing debate over high insurance rates. 
“I guess we can say this is opening day, and here’s your first pitch,” Rep. Jay Gallé, R-Mandeville, said to the House Civil Law Committee while presenting one of six so-called tort reform bills the committee considered Tuesday. 
Out of the six bills, one of the most hotly contested would limit the ability for people to recover damages for injuries sustained in accidents for which they are mostly at fault. House Bill 431 sponsored by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, cleared the committee in an 11-4 vote along party lines. 
Her bill would change Louisiana’s comparative fault statute, which assigns a percentage of blame to each party in an accident and allows for the recovery of damages in proportion with those percentages. The statute often arises in cases that involve multiple negligent acts by multiple people, some more to blame than others. 
In theory, someone partly at fault for an accident can potentially recover some of the awarded damages. Chenevert’s bill would change that to prohibit any amount of recovery by a party who’s 51% or more at fault. 
“You should not be able to collect if the accident is mostly your fault,” Chenevert said. “I would say that’s common sense. Should we reward negligence?”
But Rep. Chad Brown, D-Plaquemine, pointed out that the bill only modifies comparative fault on the plaintiff’s side and not the defendant’s. As a result, a defendant would still be protected by the liability proportions. 
“There’s a double standard here that the plaintiff is going to get zeroes if he’s 51% at fault, and the defendant is only gonna pay 51% if he’s 51% at fault,” said Brown, who is an attorney. “… The plaintiff is more imperiled than the defendant.”
Chenevert said 34 other states have a version of the law.
The committee similarly advanced House Bill 34, sponsored by Rep. Brian Glorioso, R-Slidell, in a 11-3 vote. His measure would change state law to allow any party to introduce evidence related to medical expenses. 
Currently, the law prevents juries from seeing what accident victims actually pay for medical treatment and only allows them to see what a doctor billed. In many instances, however, medical providers don’t actually receive the full amounts that they bill. At other times, Glorioso said, some lawyers work with doctors who inflate their medical billings just to get an increased payout for the plaintiff. 
Glorioso’s bill would limit a claimant’s recovery of medical expenses to “reasonable” amounts, which would be left for a judge or jury to decide. 
“Let’s let the jury see all of the evidence,” he said. “Let’s not blindfold them and just let them see one side.”
Brown countered, saying defendants get to hide details from jurors, such as whether insurance coverage is available for injuries a victim claims. He said he supports leveling the playing field between plaintiffs and insurance companies.
The committee saw Republicans prevail in another vote on House Bill 443, sponsored by Rep. Chance Henry, R-Crowley. His bill would require plaintiffs to notify defendants of an intent to file a lawsuit within 10 days of retaining a lawyer. 
Currently, plaintiffs’ lawyers can gather evidence and prepare for a lawsuit for almost two full years before a defendant is even aware a suit is coming. Henry said his bill would give a defendant the same amount of time to prepare for a claim as a plaintiff..
Democrats on the committee said if plaintiffs will be required to provide such a notice, then defendants should at least be required to respond to that notice with similar information – such as contact information for the insurance company’s lawyer and claims adjuster. 
Rep. Ed Larvadain, D-Alexandria, said many of the insurance companies he deals with in his law practice won’t return calls or even provide email addresses for anyone at the company. 
Rep. Nick Muscarello, R-Hammond, questioned how the requirement would even be enforced and encouraged Henry to work with the concerned lawmakers on potential amendments before the bill is debated on the House floor. Henry said he would.
House Bill 434, sponsored by Rep. Jason DeWitt, R-Alexandria, advanced to the floor in an 11-2 vote but saw no debate. The proposal would limit bodily injury claims by plaintiffs who did not carry auto insurance at the time of the accident. It also would forbid uninsured plaintiffs’ recovery on the first $100,000 worth of damages. 
Other bills the committee advanced include House Bill 450, sponsored by Rep. Michael Melerine, R-Shreveport, and House Bill 291, sponsored by Gallé. 
Melerine’s bill would end the Housley presumption, a standard of evidence explained in a 1991 Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that applies to auto accidents, medical malpractice and other injury lawsuits. In a nutshell, the Housley presumption says courts should assume a plaintiff’s injuries resulted from the accident in question if they were in good health beforehand.  
Lawmakers have tried repeatedly to revoke Housley, but those attempts either failed or were vetoed in previous years. This year is expected to be different as Gov. Jeff Landry recently signaled support for the measure. 
Gallé’s bill would extend the filing deadline, called a “prescriptive period,” for wrongful death lawsuits from one year to two, aligning Louisiana with the deadline found in most other states. 
Proponents of the bill have argued that a shorter prescriptive period attracts more frivolous lawsuits by essentially forcing people to quickly file claims so as to not lose their litigation rights. The proposal also complements a similar measure lawmakers approved last year to extend the deadline for filing personal injury claims.   
The committee quickly advanced both bills without objection.

Delaware continues to make gains in improving air quality, according to the 2023 Annual Air Quality Report released by the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).
The report, based on data from the DNREC Division of Air Quality’s statewide monitoring network, shows most pollutants remained below federal limits — though ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) remain persistent concerns.
The report highlights that in 2023, Delaware experienced 353 days — over 96% of the year — with air quality rated as “good” or “moderate” on the federal Air Quality Index (AQI).
However, widespread Canadian wildfires during the spring and early summer triggered several days of elevated ozone and PM2.5 levels, temporarily impacting air quality across the state.

“Even with environmental challenges beyond our control and coming our way as happened with wildfire smoke, Delaware’s air quality data continue to show steady progress,” said DNREC Division of Air Quality Director Angela Marconi. “This reflects not only decades of work to reduce emissions locally, but also our state’s ongoing collaboration in regional efforts to be key in delivering cleaner air and having a significant impact toward healthier communities.”
Despite the wildfire-related setbacks, state officials say the long-term outlook remains positive.
Air toxics in Wilmington, the state’s most industrialized area, remained low or declined further.
Most pollutants continued to meet or fall below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), with the exception of ozone and PM2.5 — both known to be exacerbated by high temperatures and pollution from vehicles and industry.
“The story of Delaware’s air is one of significant and steady progress over the years,” said DNREC Secretary Greg Patterson. “We still have challenges however, ones that affect the health of both our people and the planet. That’s why we need policies, programs and tools in place to reduce emissions and pollutants and continue to make Delaware’s air even cleaner.”
One point of clarification in the report addresses Delaware’s ozone classification.
While New Castle County is listed as “Serious Non-Attainment” for ozone, DNREC says the designation stems from its inclusion in the broader Philadelphia Non-Attainment Area — not from local pollution.
All three Delaware counties currently meet federal air quality standards for all major pollutants.
The state’s monitoring system, paired with public communication tools like AirNow.gov and DNREC’s own air data portal (de.gov/airdata), allows for real-time tracking of air quality and health alerts when pollution levels rise.

I shouldn’t need to re-introduce myself to you, but I’m Paige Sullivan. I’m a native and lifelong resident of North Carolina. I’m also transgender and a former classmate of yours. We shared the same public school hallways for twelve years. We had many of the same teachers, though never in the same classroom at the same time. 
I write to you today, standing up not only for myself, but thousands of transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary, intersex North Carolinians, and families with transgender children. Since we already know each other, let’s keep this casual. 
  Sen. Brad Overcash (R-Gaston) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Brad, what are you doing? I was shocked when I saw your name on this bill. You were always a go-getter in school, but I never thought you’d put your name on a bathroom bill like Senate Bill 516. Have you considered the implications of the bills you have sponsored? 
Can you all please explain to us how a person with a beard and a deep voice, who’s been on testosterone, belongs in the women’s room? What protections would you offer a transgender woman who is forced to use the men’s room? What will happen when someone needs to take their child or aging relative to the restroom and of a different gender? There are many other scenarios to consider, and this bill will hurt many people. 
Secondly, why is there a restriction on changing our birth certificates and driver’s licenses? Is that a personal dig at me, perchance? It’s no one’s business, especially the government’s, of what’s between our legs. On top of that, you have no idea how the transition process works. For me, it has taken the better part of twenty years. I’ve had psychological evaluations, relating directly to my gender identity, by doctors over a few years. I’ve been on estradiol injections for twelve years. I’ve had five surgeries. You don’t just walk into a clinic and have reassignment surgery. 
Okay, let’s move on to Senate Bill 227. By banning DEI programs, you’re not eliminating bias but codifying it. Students deserve to learn the full scope of American history, including the lives of Black, Indigenous, LGBTQ+, and immigrant communities. Silencing these narratives doesn’t protect kids—it denies them the tools to understand the world they’re growing up in. We went to overwhelmingly “white” schools, but you had at least three racial minorities in your graduating class. Maybe you should ask them what they think of this bill. Explain to them that because they are a racial minority, other kids shouldn’t learn about their history or struggles for freedom and equal rights. 
What’s the real reason? Brad, I know you are better than this. Stand on the right side of history. Don’t let party politics close your eyes to the harm these bills will cause. Think of your Christian beliefs. Would Jesus stand for this? I invite you to read Matthew 25:34-35, Luke 14:13, and the many teachings that call us toward justice and mercy. I’m not asking you to change overnight. I’m asking you to listen, to remember who I am, and to lead with compassion. 
We were taught in civics class that we are equal—did you forget that? Would you like me to contact some of our former teachers to provide a refresher course on the foundational documents of our country and state? I know one who would do it in a heartbeat for you. 
Brad, you and I learned the same lessons about fairness, equality, and civic responsibility. I’m not asking for a debate. I’m asking for humanity. You may not accept my meeting request, but I hope you’ll receive this: Laws like SB 516 and SB 227 harm real people. And now, you still have the chance to choose compassion over cruelty.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/transgender-illustration-768x513-1.jpeg,,,2025-04-16 13:15:30.549333

Francelis Gonzalez remembers one evening during her internship with the Norwich police department vividly. At the time she was studying social work at Fordham University and accompanying officers on calls, where she’d help to de-escalate situations and offer assistance to individuals and families in crisis.
That evening, from the window of the police car, Gonzalez spotted a man sitting on the Water Street Bridge. Within moments, she and the officer received a call. The man she’d seen on the bridge was threatening to jump.
“My legs went completely numb,” Gonzalez said. 
But she got straight to work. While the officer attended to the man, Gonzalez called an emergency psychiatric care team, known as mobile crisis. 
She also connected with the man’s family as they arrived at her location, answering questions and helping them understand the process. Gonzalez recalled telling the man’s grandmother about the dive team waiting in the water and pointing out the ambulance ready to rush him to a medical facility.
Sgt. Nick Rankin, supervisor for the Community Policing Unit in Norwich, said it was the type of situation where the presence of a social worker is particularly useful. 
Often, officers on a scene are so focused on the individual in crisis, they’re not able to assist family members, Rankin said. “So having the ability to pass them to a social worker that’s going to be there and be helpful for them — that’s invaluable.” 
Rankin also serves as director of police social work for the Social Work Law Enforcement Project, where Gonzalez was among the first interns.
The project was founded in August 2020, a few months after the mass protests against the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police, and immediately after the Connecticut legislature passed a wide-ranging law regulating various aspects of policing. The law included a requirement for local police departments to conduct a study on whether social workers could respond to certain calls either independently of or alongside police officers. 
The co-founders of the Social Work Law Enforcement Project — Isabel Logan, then a professor of social work at Eastern Connecticut State University, and Matthew Solak, a lieutenant with the Willimantic Police Department — said after they shared their model with a task force on police accountability and transparency in 2021, other professional schools and police departments began reaching out. 
Soon the program, which they had been running for free, was too large to sustain without additional help, Logan said. So they’re seeking help from the state. 
This year, the legislature is considering a bill that would establish a social work and law enforcement institute at Southern Connecticut State University, where Logan now teaches. The bill sets aside $2.2 million in both 2026 and 2027 to support the program. 
“ So the difference is that now it’ll turn from just my research to an institute that will be able to provide the resources that we need to be able to deliver the services at a bigger scale,” she said. 
Understanding how each other work
Logan had worked as a social worker in the court system for 20 years when she and Solak developed the concept to integrate social workers into police departments. 
The model focuses on three separate components of social work: helping individuals who have a run-in with the police through de-escalation or providing services; community engagement; and data collection and advocating for local and state policies. Interns who are placed with the police departments go through a week-long training focused on things like ethics, policy and safety.
One of the most critical components of her program, Logan said, was training police officers and social workers together, so they each understand how the other operates. 
Within roughly a year of the program’s lanch, other local police departments, including Milford and Norwich, had signed on along with five universities in the state. Logan said the organization sends between six and 13 social work interns to police departments in a year, and that 23 people have graduated from their program. 
Still, when Logan called up Rankin in Norwich about the program in 2021, he said he was a little leery at first — he liked the idea, but it was a tense time for police officers and he wasn’t sure how much the program might interfere with the department’s normal operations.
But Rankin recalled, as a young officer, that he’d had the opportunity to ride along with clinicians, and he said he’d learned things like how to recognize certain mental health diagnoses and what questions to ask people struggling with those conditions. He thought it could be useful for Norwich officers to learn similar things. 
“[Social workers] only see all the bad things happening to the person. [Police] only see all the bad things the person’s doing as a result.” 
Capt. Garon DelMonte with the Milford Police Department said he was immediately on board with the idea. Social workers are able to follow up with people in the community, something an officer wouldn’t do, he said. 
“Law enforcement obviously needed something, especially post-George Floyd. We were struggling to really kind of close the gaps back with our community. So this just seemed like a really … holistic approach to law enforcement that could better serve the people of our community, because we can be so limited at times,” he said.
Building relationships
Tina Marie James, now a full-time social worker with Milford’s Police Department, is still in contact with the first person she got a call about as an intern. The person was homeless and struggling with alcoholism. James went to the encampment where he was living.
“I met with him and, and I said to him … ‘If I could wave my magical wand’ — we say that often, as social workers — ‘what could I possibly provide you support with?’” Working together with the client, James said she was able to help him find housing, and he went on to mend his relationship with his daughter.
James said for people facing overlapping challenges like homelessness, substance abuse and mental health issues, it can be triggering to come face-to-face with a police officer. “They see a police officer, [and] what’s coming into their mind — They’re going to go to jail, they’re going to be arrested, they’re not going to be treated well,” James said. 
“Developing the relationships with the officers and going out and having the conversation, letting them know that we are here together as a unit — not necessarily because they’re here to arrest you. They’re here for your safety, they’re here for my safety. And it has helped a lot,” she said.
Milford Capt. DelMonte said one of the signs that the social work program was having a positive effect was a decrease in calls from people he called “frequent callers” — individuals who have regular psychological episodes that end in a call to the police. DelMonte said that while police might get the person to the hospital, they wouldn’t normally follow up beyond that.
A social worker, on the other hand, can. “We’ve had members in this community that have called us 50, 60, a hundred times for help, that once the social workers became ingrained with those people, they haven’t called us since,” he said.  
Both the police officers and the social workers said they felt social workers acted as a bridge to improve trust within their communities. 
Rankin said if lawmakers approve the funding and establish the institute at SCSU, the program would be able to standardize the training and requirements for a field that is growing.
“It’s a developing field, so you need to establish best practices.,” Rankin said. “There needs to be somebody to look to and go, ‘Who’s going to provide the training? Who’s going to do the research? Who’s going to find out what works best and why?’ And then disseminate that information.”
The proposal has been supported by both Democrats and Republicans in the legislature.
Rep. Greg Howard, R-Stonington, who is a police officer, noted during a press conference in March that police were having to deal with more and more calls regarding mental illness, which required someone who could follow-up with those people.
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, a social worker, called the combination of social work and law enforcement “more important now than ever.” 
The bill has passed out of the legislature’s Public Safety Committee and is waiting to be heard in the House of Representatives. 
For Gonzalez, who now works for the Department of Veterans Affairs, one of the most salient lessons she said she learned during her internship was that police work and social work aren’t all that different. The best thing police officers and social workers can do is show the community that they work as a unit, she said.
“ Social workers are everywhere. They’re in hospitals, they’re in the military, they’re everywhere. So why can’t we be here? I learned that we can be here … and work together,” she said.

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Photo by Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity, and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota, and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.


DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York, and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.
Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

Bussman ousted longtime 7th District chair Craig Bishop, a staffer for U.S. Rep. Michelle Fischbach, in a contest that far-right activist group Action 4 Liberty characterized as a “MASSIVE rebuke on the corrupt, anti-grassroots, and anti-liberty tactics CD7 has used to protect RINO politicians,” meaning, “Republicans in Name Only.” 
Many of Bussman’s views have become commonplace on the fringes of the Republican party, including vaccine skepticism, election denial, January 6 revisionism and a general hostility toward established science.
But a Reformer review of Bussman’s social media accounts finds that he has espoused many outlandish conspiracy theories that go well beyond standard conservative activist fare. 
He has posted about “satanic chemtrails” in the skies above Minnesota.
He has argued that the collapse of a World Trade Center building during the 9/11 terror attacks was the result of a “controlled demolition,” and that a “cruise missile,” rather than American Airlines Flight 77, struck the Pentagon that day.
He has shared multiple videos arguing that the moon landings were faked, and that more recent footage of astronauts aboard the International Space Station was faked as well.
He has shared with followers a video entitled “5 Reasons Why I BELIEVE in the Flat Earth (And You Should Too!),” as well as numerous other videos claiming that the earth is flat.
Bussman’s elevation to a leadership position is part of a statewide pattern that alarms longtime Republican activists: The party is allowing itself to be taken over by the fringe, lowering the odds of victory in future statewide elections.
“It’s bad for Republicans who want to win,” said Michael Brodkorb, former deputy chair of the Minnesota GOP who has vehemently opposed the party’s embrace of Donald Trump and figures like him, going so far as to publicly endorse Kamala Harris last year. “This is what happens when party leadership opens the gates of the insane asylum, and people come in off the streets and the inmates run it.”
On the fringes of the fringe
Bussman’s Facebook posts demonstrate a longstanding interest in multiple extreme fringe theories. On May 8, 2023, he posted a video purporting to show “leaked footage of our flat earth from 1977,” showing an obviously computer-generated animation of a dim sun traversing flat icy terrain.
A year later he shared a video stating that a pilot “proved” the earth is flat because the sun and the moon were visible in the sky at the same time, a phenomenon which occurs on most days.
And on August 14, 2024, he posted the “5 Reasons Why” video about flat earth, which asks, among other things, that if the Earth is actually spinning, “why aren’t we all being flung out into space?” 
Bussman has similarly posted multiple videos purporting to prove that the moon landings and other parts of the U.S. space program have been “faked.” He has shared video of an actor pretending to be film director Stanley Kubrick admitting that “he was responsible for faking the US Moon Program,” as well as a lengthy video claiming the landings were a “hoax” based on various false and spurious claims about film footage of them.
He has repeatedly suggested that a celestial structure called “the firmament” prevents space travel, which is a common trope among many flat-earthers.
Bussman’s conspiracy theorizing extends to world events like the 9/11 attacks as well. On March 22, 2024, he posted a conspiracy video and asked a skeptical follower “Have you seen the video of building 7 collapsing and the cruise missle [sic] hit the pentagon? I had a friend invomved [sic] in the clean up of the towers- no plane wreckage.” He has posted several other videos containing similar sentiments.
Reached by the Reformer for comment, Bussman did not deny that he was an adherent of any of the conspiracy theories that he posted about on his public Facebook profile. “You can print whatever you want,” he said. “I spent 20+ years in the Army defending that right, but if you do that, there would be no chance of me speaking with you in the future.”
The more moderate wing of the Minnesota Republican party has been attempting, mostly in vain, to keep people like Bussman away from the levers of power. Much of the energy propelling Bussman and similar candidates comes from Action 4 Liberty, a far-right group that has made a name for itself mostly by attacking elected Republicans for being insufficiently far right.
Brodkorb argues that the extent of the party’s extremism problem became clear in 2024, when it nominated Alex Jones acolyte Royce White to take on Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar in the U.S. Senate race, and Republicans in the 7th Congressional District refused to endorse Fischbach — one of the more conservative representatives in the entire U.S. House — for reelection. Fischbach nevertheless sailed to victory over her primary opponent by nearly 30 percentage points, a sign that the fringe elements taking over the party lack widespread support among GOP voters.
“Bussman has nothing on his resume that has ever shown that he can organize and win,” Brodkorb says. “That hurts Republicans statewide.” 
A Republican victory in a statewide race, for instance, will require running up the margins in reliably conservative places like the 7thDistrict. Bussman’s inexperience and fringe beliefs make that much harder to do. 
“Those views shut down conversations and alienate people inside the party,” Brodkorb said.
Bussman and his ilk will also likely alienate more moderate, independent voters in the suburbs and exurbs, which Republicans need if they are ever to overcome the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party’s numerical advantage, evidenced by the GOP’s two decade long losing streak. 
Bussman, for his part, is critical of people who don’t “do their own research” and endorse the same conspiracy theories he does.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)This story first appeared on the Maine Morning Star.
The Trump administration announced Wednesday it is suing Maine over the state’s transgender athlete policy, which the U.S. attorney general said violates federal anti-discrimination protections.
“The state of Maine is discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women’s sports, pretty basic stuff,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said during a news conference, adding that it is an issue of sports as well as safety.
The Justice Department is launching a civil suit against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools on the basis of sex. Title IX does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.
In response to the suit, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said it’s the “latest, expected salvo in an unprecedented campaign to pressure the State of Maine to ignore the Constitution and abandon the rule of law.”
“This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,” Mills said.
Mills said that her administration “will vigorously defend our state” against the Department of Justice’s lawsuit.
Title IX case against Maine schools headed to US Department of Justice

On Friday, the Maine Attorney General’s Office sent a letter to the U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights saying it would not comply with the proposed resolution agreement, which would require the state to end its transgender protections. The state also doubled down on its assertion that the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX does not have legal standing.
In a letter to Bradley Burke, regional director for the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster pointed to legal precedent that has required schools to allow trans athletes to participate on teams aligning with their gender identity.
“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” she said. “Your letters to date do not cite a single case that so holds.”
Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby appeared at the Wednesday morning news conference alongside Bondi and Education Secretary Linda McMahon. The Auburn Republican has been at the center of this controversy. After sharing photos and identifying information about a transgender student athlete on her legislative Facebook page, she was censured by her peers and stripped of the right to vote or speak on the Maine House floor until she apologizes.
That post went viral and prompted the Trump administration’s scrutiny of Maine’s policy.
Bondi read off two examples of trans girls placing in girls athletic competitions, skiing and track, and recounted the initial exchange between President Donald Trump and Mills during which the Democratic governor said she’d see Trump “in court.”
Bondi also noted that two federal departments, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, deemed Maine in violation of Title IX after brief investigations into the matter.
“We have exhausted every other remedy,” Bondi said of the suit. “We tried to get Maine to comply. We don’t like standing up here and filing lawsuits, we want to get states to comply with us.”
Bondi pointed to the many ways the federal government has punished Maine. “We’ve stripped grants from Maine through other departments and we are going to continue to fight for women,” she said.
Mills also spoke to what she described as the “politically motivated investigations that opened and closed without discussion” and referenced Friday’s federal court order requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to unfreeze payments related to Maine’s school meal programs, which the governor said “reinforces our position that the federal government has been acting unlawfully.”
“Let today serve as warning to all states: Maine might be among the first to draw the ire of the Federal government in this way, but we will not be the last,” Mills concluded.

The federal government has said people will need Real ID compliant credentials starting May 7 to board domestic flights and enter certain federal buildings. With […],"A sample Maine Driver's license provided by the Maine Secretary of State's Office. A little more than a quarter of driver’s licenses or identification cards issued by Maine’s Bureau of Motor Vehicles meet the federal requirements for what’s known as a Real ID.
The federal government has said people will need Real ID compliant credentials starting May 7 to board domestic flights and enter certain federal buildings. With that deadline less than a month away, some Maine lawmakers believe low participation in the state is not due to ignorance but rather is an “informed resistance.” 
While the policy was meant to increase security in the wake of 9/11, Democrats and Republicans in Maine have concerns about government overreach, personal privacy and the potential for data breaches. 
Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) shares in those concerns, which is why she introduced LD 160 to repeal the law that allows the Maine Secretary of State to issue a driver’s license or other identification card that meets the standards of the Real ID Act of 2005. 
“It reflects our state’s deep-rooted skepticism of federal mandates that infringe on civil liberties and a recognition that government should exist to serve and protect its citizens, not to catalog, track or intrude upon their lawful activities,” Libby told the Legislature’s Transportation Committee during a public hearing Tuesday. 
To obtain a Real ID, people must have documentation showing their full legal name, date of birth, Social Security number, proof of address and lawful status. This is often satisfied with a birth certificate, Social Security card and proof of current address, such as a utility bill. 
Libby acknowledged that people must already prove their residency to obtain a non-compliant ID, but she’s worried about the other components, especially the Social Security number. She said the law is a “dangerous consolidation of personal information.”
Collecting and storing people’s personal data increases the risk for data breaches and identity theft, she argued. She also said it acts as a “de facto national identification system,” which contradicts the principles of federalism and individual freedoms.
Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock), a co-sponsor of the bill, said one of the most alarming components of Real ID is that it creates a shared database between states. She fears it could create a one-stop shop for hackers and identity thieves. 
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows clarified that Maine is required to keep the data people bring in for their Real IDs, but the information sharing is meant to allow other states to see if someone already holds a license or Real ID elsewhere. 
A few years after the Real ID Act was passed, Maine made a bipartisan decision to reject the implementation of the policy. However, the Legislature reversed course in 2017 after the federal government threatened to limit Mainers’ ability to board flights and access federal buildings. 
Currently, Mainers can choose whether they want a driver’s license or identification card that complies with the Real ID requirements. 
However, Libby said repealing the current policy would reduce the bureaucratic burden on the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, eliminate unnecessary costs and data storage vulnerabilities, as well as protect Mainers from potential federal overreach. 
States cannot supersede federal law so while Libby’s bill would bar the Maine Secretary of State from being able to issue compliant credentials, it would not stop the Department of Homeland Security from requiring Mainers to have Real ID compliant documentation to board flights or access federal buildings. In that case, Mainers could use federally issued identification such as a passport. 
The Real ID requirement has been pushed back multiple times in the 20 years since the policy was adopted, but is scheduled to take effect next month. 
Twenty years ago, Bellows said she urged the Maine Legislature not to move forward with Real ID requirements in Maine. In fact, she still believes the federal government should repeal it for many of the same reasons Libby listed about personal privacy and the disproportionate burden it places on married women who change their names. 
Bellows explained that it can be difficult for people who change their name if their current identification card doesn’t match the name on their birth certificate. Those individuals need to show a paper trail of the change. 
However, Bellows opposes LD 160 because she thinks it’s important for Mainers to be able to choose whether they want a Real ID. Bellows said the Legislature’s decision to make it optional for Mainers was “wise.”
If this proposal passes, Bellows said it would make Maine the only state in the union unable to issue its citizens a federally accepted credential. 
Though the participation rate has been low, Bellows said Bureau of Motor Vehicle branches have seen record traffic in the past few months, with more than eight out 10 people seeking a driver’s license or ID card wanting Real IDs. 
Even with the increased traffic and long wait times, Bellows said it is still cheaper and faster for people to get a state-issued Real ID than a passport. 
The ACLU of Maine and the Maine Policy Institute support the bill.

(Photo courtesy of Dr. Priya Bansal)Patients in five states who have severe asthma and are covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield are facing a new obstacle to getting treatment.
On Tuesday, BCBS began mandating that severe asthma patients self-administer their drugs at home, unless their provider gets prior approval from the insurance company.
The patients affected are those covered in Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Montana, but not those with Medicare or Medicaid, the insurance giant says.
Given as injections, the treatments in question are Fasenra (benralizumab), Tezspire (tezepelumab), Nucala (mepolizumab) and Xolair (omalizumab). All belong to a class of drugs known as biologics.
The decision is expected to affect thousands of patients. It’s estimated that between 5% and 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, characterized by more flare-ups and hospitalizations. In Illinois, for example, about 860,000 patients have asthma, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means between 43,000 and 86,000 of them have severe asthma.
Clinics already have loads of prior authorizations to process that often delay care, said Dr. Priya Bansal, a pediatrician and asthma and allergy physician in Illinois. Her practice sees many rural patients and those with chronic disease.
“On any given day, we’ll have anywhere from 30, to my highest was 130,” she said.
The change interferes with a provider and patient decision on whether in-office or at-home treatment is best for the patient, Bansal said.
“That decision that’s supposed to go on between the physician and the patient is getting taken away,” she said. “If I have a pediatric food allergy patient and they want to get the medication in the clinic, I want to be able to have the flexibility to do that.”
The sickest asthma patients are often on biologics, explained Dr. Bridgette Jones, past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ drug committee and the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology’s asthma cough diagnosis and treatment panel.
“These are the patients that have failed at other therapies,” said Jones, a pediatric allergy and immunology physician at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Missouri. “Once you’re getting to a biologic, it means that your asthma is not under control, having frequent flare-ups.”
Black and Indigenous adults and children, as well as Puerto Rican people have higher rates of illness and less access to care.
For people who suffer from severe asthma, the typical inhaler is often not enough. The affected drugs can help manage severe, uncontrolled asthma by reducing airway inflammation,
While the drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for self-injecting at home, they also come with risks for the uncommon but life-threatening anaphylaxis.
That’s why providers typically start patients on these drugs in-office for monitoring.
But for at least one of the drugs, Xolair, the reaction can also happen up to a year into treatment.
Many families are not comfortable administering biologics to their kids with severe asthma, Jones said.
Clinics serving higher-need or underserved populations may often lack the resources to deal with more prior approvals, she added.
A recent study by Massachusetts General Hospital and funded by Amgen, which developed Tezspire with AstraZeneca, suggested that in some states, the percentage of asthma patients with severe asthma is higher than 10%. In Texas, for example, about 23% of severe persistent asthma had severe uncontrolled disease.

(Photo courtesy of DNR) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is investigating a fish kill near Fort Dodge, caused by a leak of a fertilizer byproduct, according a press release. 
The spill reached the South Branch of Lizard Creek, where DNR staff observed dead fish for several miles and the byproduct, causing brown, murky water stretched around seven road-miles downstream from the facility involved.
DNR received a call Monday from CJ Bio America, reporting that byproduct from making lysine, which the company manufactures as an amino acid for animal feed, had leaked from the facility into a stormwater channel. 
Dan Bratrud, an environmental specialist with DNR said the byproduct is typically used as a soil amendment and in its current state is “high in ammonia and quite corrosive.” 
DNR reported that the company believed the byproduct had been contained via a berm in the stormwater channel, but later discovered a breach in the berm allowed an unknown amount of the byproduct to flow into surface intakes of a neighboring field. From the surface intakes, the byproduct flowed to the South Branch of Lizard Creek.
Bratrud said the water was too murky early in the week to perform a fish kill count, but said Wednesday the fisheries team was at the site to count.
“Hopefully we can get some more information gathered,” Bratrud said, noting he and other staff were headed to the site. 
According to the department, the leak was stopped Monday, but flow rates in the creek have made it not possible for staff to place berms to contain the byproduct in the creek. 
This is the first reported fish kill in this stream, according to DNR’s water quality database.
DNR staff collected water samples from the site and will continue to investigate the spill. Creek users downstream of the event are advised to avoid the creek.

(Photo: Anna Liz Nichols) Mark Totten, a former U.S. attorney, has declared his candidacy to be Michigan’s next attorney general, becoming the first Democrat to declare for the position. 
Totten was nominated by former President Joe Biden to be the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Michigan, a post he served in from May 2022 through January 2025. Totten previously served as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s chief legal counsel from 2019 to 2022. He taught criminal law at Michigan State University from 2009 to 2018. 
With sitting Attorney General Dana Nessel unable to run again in 2026 due to term limits, the race for Michigan’s top legal office will likely be hotly contested.
Totten led Whitmer’s legal fight to protect reproductive freedom after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. In his role as U.S. Attorney, Totten prosecuted two men from Nigeria in an international sextortion scheme that led to the suicide of 17-year-old Jordan DeMay, as well as Rashad Trice, who was convicted in August for the murdering  2-year-old Wynter Cole-Smith and sexually assaulting her mother. 
“On January 20th, my term of service as U.S. attorney came to an end. And  since then I have watched in horror as a president has stoked division, trampled civil rights and undermined the very rule of law. I refuse to stand by and watch and that’s why I’m running for attorney general: to fight for you and to fight for everything we hold dear,” Totten said in a video announcing his candidacy.

Gov. Laura Kelly signed it. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A new Kansas law adopts the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of antisemitism — a definition that has been criticized for conflating criticism of the state of Israel with antisemitism. 
The legislature passed and Gov. Laura Kelly signed the bill that declares antisemitism, as defined by IRHA, is “against the public policy of this state, including, but not limited to, the purposes of public educational institutions and law enforcement agencies in this state.”
David Soffer with the Combat Antisemitism Movement said that a clause in the definition prevents conflation of criticism of Israel with antisemitism. 
“It does differentiate the fact that criticism of Israel is perfectly OK, as long as it is held to the same standard that you would criticize another country,” Soffer said. “We know that there are criticisms of Israel’s own government amongst its people because it is a democracy, no different than here in the United States.” 
The definition reads that “manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.”
Jack Goldstein with the Jewish Voice for Peace of Kansas City said the clause is vague. 
One example of antisemitism the IHRA provides is “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.”
“We’ve seen the definition be leveraged to silence voices that are dissenting against Israel for reasons that would be fair to critique other countries,” Goldstein said. “For example, their aggression in the Middle East.” 
Goldstein is referencing the Israel-Hamas war that sparked campus protests last May, which notably led to the detainment of Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil.
President Donald Trump recently adopted the IHRA’s definition in an executive order, which has been used to strip funding from Columbia University over claims that the school failed to address antisemitism.  
“The main purpose of a bill like this is to shut down opposition to Israel on college campuses,” Goldstein said. “Especially with the Republicans in power right now, that is within their interest, to silence dissent like that. Especially when our country is tied to Israel and still sending lots of money and weapons to the country.”
Senate Bill 44 passed the Kansas House and Senate with bipartisan support. A similar bill in Missouri faced more pushback from Democrats. 
Soffer said the main purpose of the bill is to ensure Jewish students are not threatened or harassed. He referenced the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas on Israel. The 1,200 Israeli deaths and 250 hostages taken that day triggered an intense war.
“There was an event at (the University of Kansas) where they held a survivor from Oct. 7th, and groups stormed that event and harassed the individual that was there and the students themselves,” Soffer said. “So the question one must ask is, ‘Why can’t they even hold an event?’ ” 
The new Kansas law states the definition is “non-legally binding,” meaning it’s not enforceable in court.
Michael Rebne was on the Roeland Park City Commission when it passed an ordinance adopting the IHRA definition, and he heard supporters point to the fact that it’s not legally binding. 
“It ends up actually having the force of something that’s legally binding,” Rebne said. “As the mayor said, in Roeland Park, this will be a way to advise the police of any potential acts of antisemitism within Roeland Park.” 
With the new state law, Rebne, who is a teacher in the Kansas City, Kansas, public school district, said he is worried for his students — both Jewish and Palestinian. Rebne said the law makes teachers fearful to teach about the subject at all, even stating data about the number of people killed.

(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source New Mexico)The federal judge overseeing the lawsuit between New Mexico, Texas and Colorado over Rio Grande water has ordered a 10-day trial in Philadelphia starting June 9 at the request of all the parties, who are also pursuing mediation talks to resolve the lawsuit in the meantime.
The case, officially called Original No. 141 Texas v. New Mexico and Colorado, began more than a decade ago, sparked by escalating legal disputes around Rio Grande water below Elephant Butte between Texas and New Mexico.
The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the federal government — which operates a network of dams, and nearly 140 miles of irrigation canals to deliver water to two irrigation districts in the region and Mexico — to enter as a party to the case in 2018.
In the February status hearings, the federal mediator and attorneys for all three parties told United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Chief Judge D. Brooke Smith, who is overseeing the case, that they were still seeking a resolution to the 12-year old case.
Jeffrey Wechsler, the lead attorney representing New Mexico, said setting a trial date would help mediation talks.
“Deadlines help negotiations rather than hinder them,” Wechsler said, according to transcripts of the hearing.
The New Mexico Department of Justice and other parties’ attorneys confirmed to Source NM that mediation talks are ongoing as of April, with another mediation session scheduled for April 22, according to NMDOJ Chief of Staff Lauren Rodriguez. “Meanwhile, the trial—focused on determining liability and establishing a baseline for apportionment under the compact—remains on schedule,” she wrote in a statement, “if an agreement is not reached by then.”
Any potential settlement or recommendation from Smith based on a trial would still need approval from the U.S. Supreme Court, the only court that handles interstate waters disputes.
Last year, U.S. Supreme Court justices struck down a deal proposed by New Mexico, Colorado and Texas to end the litigation in a close 5-4 decision. They sided with objections from the federal government that the states’ deal unfairly excluded the “unique federal interests,” and sent the case back to the negotiation table and potentially trial.
The alliances between the state and federal government in the case have dramatically shifted since 2022 as the nature of the dispute changed. Initially, Texas and the federal government agreed that New Mexico pumping below Elephant Butte threatened Rio Grande water for both Texas irrigation and treaty obligations to Mexico.
However, since Colorado, New Mexico and Texas proposed a deal to measure Texas’ water at the state line and include transfers of water between New Mexico and Texas irrigation districts to balance out shortfalls, the federal government is going to have to build its own case.
“Texas and the United States are no longer aligned,” federal attorney Thomas Snodgrass told Smith in February. He said the federal government was still preparing a case that New Mexico should be held liable for groundwater pumping impacts on the Rio Grande since 1938.
The court already held one part of a two-part trial in October 2021, but the proposed settlement delayed the second part indefinitely.
Weschler told Smith in February that if the case does proceed to trial in June, it will be shorter than the three-months set aside for trial in 2021.
“The case is prepared for trial. In fact, it’s halfway through trial,” Weschler said. “We’ve completed our discovery, we’ve completed disclosures — there’s really not much more to do other than to begin.”

A lawsuit filed by three tribal governments is seeking to overturn a permit for IPOP LLC's planned gold dredging in Bonanza Channel, part of Safety Sound. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Three Alaska Native tribes have filed a lawsuit to overturn the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit granted to a company seeking to dredge for gold in a sensitive wetland area near Nome.
The tribes, in their complaint filed on April 10 in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, said the Corps had erred by issuing a wetlands-ill permit to Nevada-based IPOP Ltd.
The company is seeking to dredge for gold in Bonanza Channel, a section of Safety Sound, about 20 miles east of Nome.
The Corps granted a permit to IPOP in March 2024, reversing its 2022 permit denial.
In their lawsuit, the Village of Solomon, Native Village of Council and King Island Native Community said the project threatens fish, birds and other natural resources important to Native subsistence practices in the region. Safety Sound, which is fed by four rivers, is “rich in biological diversity” and is a place where people fish, collect eggs, pick berries and gather greens, and hunt birds, seals and other game.
The Corps’ initial denial was the correct decision, the complaint said; it noted that other federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service, found numerous faults in the IPOP plan.
In a statement released by Earthjustice, the environmental law firm representing the three tribes, one of the tribal leaders said Bonanza Channel is important to Native culture and identity.
“This land and its waters are who we are. Now, the IPOP mine threatens to destroy them. Every local organization opposes this project — ask anyone who lives here. We must stand united in our resistance,” Kirsten Timbers, president of the Village of Solomon, said in the statement.
The tribes’ lawsuit follows a March 11 decision by a state agency to reject IPOP’s request for a different permit that is also necessary for the project to start.
The Alaska Division of Mining, Land and Water — part of the state Department of Natural Resources — denied IPOP’s application for a land-use permit and rejected its plan for reclamation.
While IPOP cannot go forward without that DNR permit, the plaintiffs wanted to overturn the Corps permit as well, said Carole Holley, an Earthjustice attorney representing the tribes
It is possible that IPOP could appeal the DNR rejection or reapply for that permit, she said by email.
“The Clean Water Act permit from the Army Corps of Engineers, unless overturned, would be in place until the year 2030. Our clients contend the permit was illegally approved and that any mining that would occur within Bonanza Channel would permanently harm the ecosystem and thus, their traditional lifeways.  With the mining paused, our clients are able to challenge the permit and hopefully get a ruling before any permanent damage can be done,” she said.
A spokesperson for the Corps’ Hawaii-based Pacific Ocean Division, which issued the permit to IPOP, declined to comment on the tribes’ lawsuit.
Nahaku McFadden, regional director of public affairs for the division, said the policy is to not comment on pending litigation.
The IPOP project has an unusual history. It was originally pitched as the setting for a reality TV show called “Rivers of Gold.” The sponsors of the project also said they intended to create a luxury gold brand and tosell clothing, souvenirs and jewelry imprinted with a Rivers of Gold logo.
IPOP representatives were not available for comment.

Larry Rhoden hasn’t said whether he’s running to keep his office next year, but his actions during the first few months of his administration suggest he could reshuffle expectations for the race if he decides to join it. “Whether we can win is certainly a consideration, and truth be told, I’ve been receiving […]","Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden hasn’t said whether he’s running to keep his office next year, but his actions during the first few months of his administration suggest he could reshuffle expectations for the race if he decides to join it.
“Whether we can win is certainly a consideration, and truth be told, I’ve been receiving encouragement from people all across South Dakota to run,” Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight.
Since succeeding Kristi Noem a few months ago, Rhoden’s put a contentious pipeline debate partially to rest, sought to smooth out Noem’s contentious relationships with Native American tribes and the media, convinced the Legislature to pass a property tax relief bill and launched an “Open for Opportunity” tour that has him meeting with the state’s business leaders and shaking hands across South Dakota.
“I’m humbled by all the support, but we are not ready to make an announcement until this tour is over,” he said. 
Rhoden, who’s serving out the remainder of Noem’s second term, is off to a “good start” if he hopes to win the Republican Party’s 2026 gubernatorial nomination, according to Mike Card, professor emeritus of political science at the University of South Dakota. 
But Rhoden is not the only hopeful with a tailwind.
New SD Governor Larry Rhoden says immediate focus is getting to work, not his political future

Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, long rumored as a candidate for governor, raised more than $1 million in the first quarter of this year. That leaves him with $6.8 million in his various campaign accounts. Rhoden had about $90,000 in his committee account at the end of 2024.
 Johnson has a few other important things going for him, said Pat Powers, who writes the right-leaning South Dakota War College blog.
“You will not outwork Dusty on the campaign trail,” Powers said. “And I’m not kidding when I say that he’s got an unmatched campaign team.”
Powers said Johnson is likely running for governor. Johnson’s office acknowledged his interest.
“He’s committed to his day job representing South Dakota in the U.S. House, but is considering a run for governor,” a Johnson campaign spokesperson said. “He expects to make that decision over the summer or fall.”
The race could include other competition. Powers mentioned Aberdeen businessman and boldly pro-Trump Republican Toby Doeden and Republican state House Speaker Rep. Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids as potential entrants in the 2026 race. Attorney General Marty Jackley is another name in the mix. Jackley ran unsuccessfully against Noem for the Republican nomination for governor in 2018.
Powers said Rhoden’s West River appeal — he’s a boots-and-hat-wearing rancher from Union Center — “makes it tougher for Marty,” who grew up in Sturgis and has farm and ranch land near Vale and Pierre. Without Rhoden, Jackley could’ve staked out a position as the only West River bona fide candidate, Powers said.
Republican Jake Schoenbeck, co-host of the Dakota Town Hall political podcast, said Rhoden’s West River appeal could be enough to box out Jackley.
“I just don’t see a path for Marty when Rhoden is already the governor,” Schoenbeck said.
Jackley told South Dakota Searchlight he is receiving encouragement to run for governor “from people who want a conservative in the race.”
“But right now I’m focused on keeping our streets safe and protecting tax payer dollars,” Jackley said.


Because Rhoden’s actions as the state’s chief executive are covered consistently by the media, Schoenbeck said, Rhoden’s name recognition will only grow from now until the election. That could be the equivalent of millions of dollars in free advertising.
“And people will see him as governor,” Schoenbeck said. “They will be able to picture him in the office, and see him addressing South Dakota issues.”
Both Powers and Schoenbeck said Johnson looms large east of the Missouri River, particularly in the state’s most populous city of Sioux Falls.
Rhoden’s lieutenant governor, Tony Venhuizen, grew up in the small East River town of Armour and lives in Sioux Falls, where he’s well-connected and could help Rhoden raise campaign funds.
Powers said Venhuizen was instrumental in the campaigns and the fundraising for his father-in-law, former Gov. Dennis Daugaard.
“But you know, Dusty also has a long relationship with many of those top donors,” Powers said. 
Daugaard, Johnson’s former boss, endorsed Johnson for governor in Oct. 2024.
“I think he plans to run for governor, and I’m four-square behind him,” Daugaard told South Dakota Searchlight at the time. That was prior to Noem joining the Trump administration and Venhuizen becoming lieutenant governor.
State Rep. Will Mortenson, R-Fort Pierre, is a friend of both Johnson and Venhuizen. He also worked on Johnson’s first campaign for a seat on South Dakota’s commission of utility regulators. Mortenson sees Johnson as the candidate best positioned to run for governor.
“It’s not just the millions he raised,” Mortenson said. “It’s the thousands of South Dakotans who gave him the funds and support him strongly. There is a big sense out there that we need to get South Dakota moving again, and no one has a better track record of getting things done than Dusty.”
Johnson’s political brand
In 2022, Johnson bested Taffy Howard, now a state senator from Rapid City, when she challenged him in a primary for U.S. Representative and earned 41% support.
Howard is still no fan of Johnson’s. His politics, she said, will adjust to “whichever way the wind is blowing” so he can stay in office. 
“And right now, that means going along to get along with Trump,” Howard said.
Rep. Johnson answers criticism by pointing to record and private sector experience

Card, the USD political scientist, said Johnson wants to appear further to the right on the political spectrum, to thwart a right-wing primary challenger.
“He has gone MAGA,” Card said, pointing to Johnson’s introduction of legislation authorizing the president to buy back the Panama Canal, shortly after Trump brought up the idea.
Card said Johnson may be coming off as inauthentic not only to Trump supporters, but also to the people who previously understood him to be a bipartisan, moderate Republican. It’s a point Shoenbeck echoed.
“That’s not something I would have expected two years ago – not something I would have expected of him,” Schoenbeck said.
Rhoden does not have the same kind of problems as Johnson regarding perceptions of his political identity, Schoenbeck said. 
Johnson disagrees with Card’s and Schoenbeck’s assessments.
“When you actually look at the legislation that we’ve introduced, and when you look at the legislative successes we’ve had, which, again, by the numbers, are substantial, you see that that is the profile of a serious lawmaker,” Johnson said. 
Johnson ranked 14th most effective among 222 Republican U.S. House members during the 117th Congress, and 58th of 228 during the 118th, according to the Center for Effective Lawmaking, which is a project of the University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University. 
The Trump card
Trump’s endorsement, should it come, could determine the outcome of the primary election. The president, who now employs Noem in his cabinet, endorsed Noem after the 2018 primary and ahead of the 2022 primary.
The endorsement is Rhoden’s to lose given he loyally served as Noem’s lieutenant governor, Schoenbeck said.
“Trump supporters listen to Trump. And if Noem goes to Trump and asks him to endorse Rhoden, why wouldn’t he do it?” he said. “And why wouldn’t she do that for Rhoden?”
Johnson is cultivating a relationship with Trump, including with a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in January. But he could have a tougher time winning Trump’s endorsement. He voted to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. He also voted to create an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection in the U.S. Capitol, though he later voted against creating the House select committee that ultimately did the investigation. Johnson voted against ejecting Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney – a Trump target of scorn – from House leadership.
Toby Doeden identifies as a pro-Trump Republican. He formed an exploratory committee to consider a Republican U.S. House primary challenge against Johnson last year, while criticizing Johnson as a “career politician” and a liberal. Doeden later decided against running and instead focused on influencing state politics through his political action committee, Dakota First Action.

Doeden told South Dakota Searchlight he and his family are praying about whether he should enter the governor’s race. He said Rhoden is another establishment candidate not delivering Trump’s agenda. Doeden “cannot imagine a situation where the political donors allow both Dusty and Larry to run.”
“President Trump likes winners and leaders who can deliver, something Rhoden clearly lacks the ability to do,” Doeden said.
That stands in contrast to Rhoden’s record since becoming governor, which includes delivering on numerous Republican priorities. During the 2025 legislative session, Rhoden signed bills holding down property tax increases, allowing concealed pistols in bars and on public college campuses, restricting transgender people’s access to restrooms in schools and state buildings, requiring age verification for adult websites, and mandating appeal processes for obscenity decisions by libraries. He also tightened residency rules for voting and signed a bill banning eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines. 
The new grassroots
South Dakota Republican Party Chairman Jim Eschenbaum said he was surprised when Rhoden signed the bill banning carbon sequestration pipelines from using eminent domain. Doing so was a top priority for a faction of the party. 
The pipeline ban followed strong grassroots opposition to Summit Carbon Solutions’ $9 billion CO2 transport project.
“I think Governor Rhoden did very well this legislative session,” Eschenbaum said. But he said there is still plenty of time between now and the primary election on June 2, 2026. 
Q&A: South Dakota’s new Republican Party chairman wants to weed out fake Republicans

Eschenbaum told South Dakota Searchlight that many Republicans he speaks with are critical of Johnson. A name they like is state House Speaker Jon Hansen. 
Hansen would sometimes be introduced as “our governor” during rallies in opposition of Summit’s pipeline. He told South Dakota Searchlight that he plans to “make an announcement sometime in the near future.”
“I, together with a lot of great conservatives, have been fighting for an even better South Dakota where you and your family come first – not big money special interests and corporate welfare lobbyists,” Hansen said in a statement.
Amanda Radke is farmer, rancher, and influencer amongst the state party’s grassroots. She hosts The Heart of Rural America podcast and writes The Radke Report blog. Hansen’s efforts to defeat the 2024 abortion-rights ballot measure and ban carbon pipelines from using eminent domain, she said, have made him “a powerhouse and in the trenches of the conservative grassroots movement.”  
“Should he decide to run and enter this arena, he would bring a powerful coalition of everyday South Dakota citizens,” Radke said.
Dan Ahlers is the executive director of the Democratic Party in the state. He said South Dakota can expect a contested primary election for Democrats as well, but did not divulge any names. 
“We have a couple people that are looking at the governor’s race,” Ahlers said. “We could have contested races for all three of those top statewide races.”

Shortly after deadly wildfires ignited in Los Angeles County in January, California lawmakers introduced bills to stiffen penalties for arson and other related crimes. One contentious measure — which had the backing of nearly every environmental organization in California — also sought to hold oil companies accountable for wildfires and climate disasters.
The bill failed to advance last week, but not due to any fierce opposition from oil companies. Rather — in yet another example of how Big Oil wins in a state known for being a “climate leader” — it was Big Labor that had the outsized role in blocking the bill.
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, the proposal by Sen. Scott Wiener would have allowed wildfire victims and insurers to sue oil companies for causing climate disasters. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week, the San Francisco Democrat argued that destructive wildfires during the winter have become “the new normal in California.”

Wiener: “And right now, who is paying for these climate disasters? … We’re paying for them.” 

The only major political donor supporting the proposal was the California Federation of Teachers, which gave at least $2.5 million to legislators since 2015, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.
Fossil fuel companies, as well as other business groups, did push against the bill. But the biggest donors in opposition were trade unions, which gave a total of at least $12 million to lawmakers over the last decade.

Chris Hannan, president of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California: “This bill’s terrible, terrible policy. And it puts our jobs in jeopardy and puts our state in jeopardy.” 

Compared to other lobbying organizations, labor unions fare better at passing or spiking legislation that fits their agenda, and roughly a quarter of the Legislature is made up of current or former union members. At the hearing, the judiciary committee, composed mostly of pro-labor Democrats, rejected the measure.

Still waiting for Newsom’s tax returns

From CalMatters Capitol reporter Alexei Koseff:
Another tax season came to a close this week without any sign of the tax returns that Gov. Gavin Newsom once pledged to make public.
It has now been more than three years since Newsom — who said before taking office in 2019 that he would be the first governor to release his tax filings annually — has shared them.
CalMatters reported in November, amid renewed scrutiny of the governor’s finances following his purchase of a $9 million Marin County home, that Newsom last made a tax return available in March 2022. That disclosure came during his re-election campaign, under a state law, signed by Newsom himself, which requires gubernatorial candidates to release their five most recent income tax returns.
With the tax filing deadline arriving on Tuesday for most Californians, CalMatters followed up with Newsom’s team about his pledge. Spokesperson Nathan Click said the governor would eventually allow reporters to review his subsequent tax returns, but did not provide a timeline.



Southern CA Kaiser strike pushes on

In what the National Union of Healthcare Workers considers to be the longest mental health strike in U.S. history, mental health care workers at Southern California Kaiser Permanente are close to entering their sixth month of striking, writes CalMatters’ Joe Garcia.
Their demands include cost of living wage increases, restoration of pension benefits and more time between therapy sessions for patient follow-up. In March former Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly and former Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg agreed to mediate, but union negotiators voted shortly after to suspend talks when they argued Kaiser refused to consider the three major contract issues. 
Bargaining talks were scheduled to resume on Tuesday — three days after Kaiser mental health care employees concluded their hunger strike on April 12. For five days, eight workers fasted at a West Hollywood church, slept on air mattresses and subsisted on water and electrolytes. 

Adriana Webb, union member: “Kaiser’s trying to starve us out, that’s clear — so, give them what they want. I feel hungry for equity. I feel hungry for change. How is this any different?”

Kaiser spokesperson Terry Kanakri said the company’s goal is to reach an agreement that makes Kaiser “the best place to give and receive care,” but that the union “has made very little movement on the key bargaining issues,” over the past nine months.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)NJ Transit locomotive engineers have rejected a tentative contract deal in a dispute over wages, setting the stage for a possible strike next month.
Members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen voted overwhelmingly against the offer, with 87% of the 427 engineers who cast votes in opposition. Bargaining teams for the union and management had signed a tentative deal March 6, but it required ratification by union members and approval by NJ Transit’s board.
By nixing the deal, the engineers set the clock ticking for “self-help,” under which they could strike under the rules of the Railway Labor Act or NJ Transit could lock out workers. Self-help could begin on May 15. The monthlong delay is meant to allow time for further negotiations.
James Louis, the union’s vice president, said both sides will return to the bargaining table to try to resolve their differences. Engineers already have authorized the union to call a strike if a voluntary settlement isn’t reached.
“We want to have uninterrupted rail service for all who depend on it, but we also want to reach a fair agreement for engineers,” Louis said in a statement. “If we fail to reach an agreement in the next month, we’re prepared to strike.”
Kris Kolluri, the agency’s president and CEO, said he was disappointed by the vote but still hopes to reach a deal.
“I am committed to returning to the bargaining table immediately and meeting every day, for as long as it takes, to get it done,” Kolluri said in a statement.
News of the union’s rejection of the deal came hours after Gov. Phil Murphy said Amtrak and NJ Transit were making repairs that would avert another summer of service delays and cancelations.
When the two sides reached the tentative deal last month, Kolluri and BLET general chairman Thomas Haas said it reflected “NJ Transit’s commitment to fairness, efficiency, innovation, and long-term financial sustainability.”
Haas said this week that NJ Transit’s locomotive engineers have not had a raise since 2019. Sagging salaries have prompted some engineers to leave NJ Transit for nearby railroads with higher wages, union officials said.
“We earn less than our peers at other commuter railroads that share the same platforms,” Haas said in a statement. “For years, we have faced managers who prioritized spending on pet projects including a half-billion dollars for a corporate headquarters with penthouse views, but those same managers couldn’t find an extra dime for their train crews.”
Staffing shortages during the Christie administration contributed to service delays and cancellations, and union officials warned that could happen again.
“Between retirements and those leaving for greener pastures elsewhere, NJ Transit is facing a repeat of the previous engineer shortage, compounded by an inability to recruit new engineers due to substandard wages,” Haas said.
The last railroad strike against NJ Transit was in 1983, according to the union. The agency narrowly avoided a strike in 2016, when contract negotiations settled mere hours before the strike deadline.
NJ Transit is the nation’s third-largest commuter railroad, with 195,000 passengers on an average weekday, according to the union.

Labor unions, not Big Oil, led the opposition.","In summary
The Senate Judiciary Committee spiked a bill to let wildfire victims sue oil companies over climate change. Labor unions, not Big Oil, led the opposition.


Oil companies had their hackles up this year after Sen. Scott Wiener introduced a controversial bill that would allow victims of wildfires and other climate disasters to sue them for causing climate change. 
Facing potentially billions of dollars in losses, Big Oil had a lot to lose. 
But oil companies took a back seat last week when it came time to persuade environmentally friendly lawmakers to kill the legislation.
Instead, Big Oil’s most influential allies in California’s Democratic-controlled Legislature – the unions that represent oil industry workers – led the opposition. They successfully persuaded a committee made up of pro-labor Democrats to kill the measure, which had support from nearly every California environmental organization.
Despite California’s reputation for taking the lead on climate change, the death of Senate Bill 222 is the latest example of how environmentalists’ most aggressive policies regularly fizzle out when Big Labor works on behalf of Big Oil. 
“That’s how the oil companies breach the machine in Sacramento,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, one of the groups that supported the legislation.
A spokesperson for the Western States Petroleum Association, which typically represents oil company interests in Sacramento, declined to comment on why the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California took the lead in killing the legislation.
Chris Hannan, the trades council’s president, said union members feared SB 222 would have a “chilling effect on our economy, setting gas prices through the roof, with absolutely no environmental benefits.”
“This bill’s terrible, terrible policy,” he said. “And it puts our jobs in jeopardy and puts our state in jeopardy.” 
Big money turns out to oppose climate bill
At last week’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, argued his proposal was urgent after January’s massive wildfires tore through Los Angeles County, destroying thousands of homes and exacerbating the state’s housing and insurance crises.
“We’re not supposed to have destructive wildfires in the middle of winter,” he told the committee. “And yet that is the new normal in California. And right now, who is paying for these climate disasters? Who’s paying for them? We’re paying for them.” 
Wiener’s measure would have allowed victims to sue oil companies for damages, but they would have to prove in court that climate change was specifically to blame for their losses, which is not easy. While scientists have documented the connection between climate change and fossil fuels, the evidence is less definitive linking fossil fuels to specific extreme weather events such as floods, droughts or wildfires.

Two witnesses Wiener brought to testify in support of SB 222 had lost their homes to wildfires. They argued that it’s time for the fossil fuel companies to pay their fair share. 
“Disasters like this are going to keep happening, but you can make the financial burden less awful for all of us,” Moira Morel, whose home burned in the Eaton Fire, told the committee. 
After they spoke, representatives of more than 20 environmental and consumer attorney groups walked up the microphone urging the committee to pass the measure. 
The California Federation of Teachers, which has given at least $2.5 million to legislators since 2015, was the only major political donor supporting it, according to the Digital Democracy database.
But that paled in comparison to what its opponents have spent on politics: at least $22.7 million to members of the Legislature since 2015, according to Digital Democracy.
They included major business groups such as the California Chamber of Commerce and the Civil Justice Association of California, whose board of directors includes representatives from major corporations including Amazon, Pfizer, Apple and Meta, which didn’t didn’t directly take positions on the bill. Those two advocacy groups alone have given nearly $2 million to legislators since 2015.  
Michael McDonough, a lawyer who spoke on behalf of the business groups, told the committee the bill was likely unconstitutional and “retroactively punishes the legal production of fuel for this state, which has been critical for California’s growth since its founding, and which this Legislature has supported for nearly 150 years.” 
Organizations representing fossil fuel companies that opposed the bill but gave no testimony during last week’s hearing also have donated at least $1.7 million to legislators since 2015.  
Democrats find union argument persuasive
But the Legislature’s biggest donors that opposed SB 222 are the trade unions. The State Building and Construction Trades Council, the California State Association Of Electrical Workers and the California State Pipe Trades Council and their affiliate unions have given at least $12 million since 2015, according to Digital Democracy. 
“SB 222 unfairly targets one industry, while ignoring the broader systematic factors that contribute to climate change,” the trade unions’ lobbyist, Keith Dunn, told the committee.
Dozens of rank-and-file union members – pipefitters, boiler makers, painters, iron workers and others – took the mic after Dunn to urge lawmakers to spike SB 222. Many of them looked fresh off the jobsite, wearing safety glasses and T-shirts emblazoned with their union logos. It was a striking contrast in the Capitol, where business wear tends to be the standard attire. 
The measure needed seven votes to advance out of the Senate Judiciary Committee; it failed with just five votes in favor and eight recorded votes opposed. Yet only one Democrat on the committee actually voted “no.” The rest didn’t vote at all, which counts the same as a no vote. As CalMatters has reported, the widespread practice of dodging tough votes allows legislators to avoid accountability. 
There are few groups more influential in state politics than unions in California, despite only representing one-sixth of the state’s workforce. 
As CalMatters reported, labor groups regularly get their way on bills at higher rates than other prolific lobbying groups, due in part to their massive political donations. Around a quarter of the members of the current Legislature are current or former union members. 
One of them is Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles and a member of the committee who didn’t vote on the measure. The long-time former labor activist told the committee that companies that cause climate change should be held accountable, but not at the expense of workers.
“I don’t want to let anyone off the hook, but I don’t want to let working people be on the hook for everything that happens,” Durazo told the committee.

Her office didn’t respond to an interview request to ask why, if she opposed the measure, she didn’t cast a firm “no” vote. The four other Democrats on the committee who also didn’t vote for SB 222 – Aisha Wahab, Angelique Ashby, Tom Umberg and Jesse Arreguín – declined CalMatters requests to explain in an interview why they didn’t vote.  
Sen. Anna Caballero, who represents Merced, was the one Democrat who voted “no.” Like Durazo, she found the union members’ arguments persuasive. She said the costs of the measure would be too high. She urged the Legislature to focus on promoting climate-friendly technologies such as “hydrogen, carbon capture, biogas, biomass.”
“Those are the kinds of jobs that will create a livable wage and also give us the opportunity to meet our climate goals,” Caballero told the committee. “And I think we’re all interested in the same goal … but we’re not going to get that through this litigation.”
Sen. Henry Stern, a Democrat who lost his home in the 2018 Woolsey Fire, addressed the union workers directly before he voted to support the legislation.He said the bill was about making multinational corporations accountable. He said the oil companies had been threatening “their workers that they’re going to fire them” if the Legislature passed SB 222.
“This is targeting those shareholders and those boardroom folks who are making the big decisions back at some corporate headquarters out in Houston or somewhere else, but not you,” he told the committee.
Wiener said in an interview that he wasn’t surprised the trades unions “are fighting to keep those jobs.”
“But it continues to surprise me that the California Legislature doesn’t pass the oil accountability bills, with only a few exceptions,” he said. “I hope that the Legislature will start taking a much more proactive stance to hold the oil companies accountable for the huge harm that they have done and are doing to California and to the planet.”

HB 437 was sent to the Senate for its consideration.
  Rep. Heather Rhyne (Photo: NC General Assembly)
Rep. Heather Rhyne (R-Lincoln) said the bill is needed because the state’s homeless population is under regular threat from dealers seeking to sell them controlled substances.
“By making homeless shelters drug-free zones, we reduce the opportunity for these criminal elements to further victimize the homeless while holding operators of these facilities accountable,” said Rhyne, a bill cosponsor. “Providing a safe and secure environment where treatment is provided and the people can get the help they need to become self-dependent is the focus of the bill.”
Rhyne noted that HB 437 also requires signs designating them as drug-free zones. She said shelters needing anonymity such as those serving victims of domestic violence would be allowed to place signs inside front entrances.
The House approved the legislation over the objection of service providers, 140 of which signed a letter opposing the bill. Rep. Julia Greenfield (D-Mecklenburg) shared part of the letter with colleagues.

“As a nurse who was always working in the trenches, I kind of believe it’s important to listen to those who are working in the trenches and to take into consideration their concerns,” Greenfield said.
She said service providers support the larger intent of HB 437 to keep drug dealers away from facilities serving people experiencing homelessness. They are concerned, however, that the bill would hold service providers criminally responsible for “intentionally allowing” drug dealing to takes place within 100 feet of their property.
Greenfield read this passage from the letter: “This implication that service providers are the enemy in working to keep those we serve safe instead of a partner in an incredibly challenging effort to provide both welcoming and safe space is incredibly hurtful and disappointing. This work carries enough risk without the threat of a felony conviction and jail time, depending on how someone interprets “intentionally allows.”
Service providers are also concerned about the expenses of possibly having to hire armed security and fencing off property to ensure criminal drug activity doesn’t take place.
“If the General Assembly would like to work to protect those we serve, homeless service providers would welcome specialized funding to support the personal and design enhancements to improve safety on our campuses,” the service providers said in the letter to lawmakers.
Rep. Allen Chesser (R-Nash) said service providers’ words “fall flat” because the bill speaks to possession with intent to sell and deliver drugs, not simple possession.
“So, we’re not sending the users, the end users to jail with this, we’re targeting dealers,” Chesser said.
He said the burden will be on law enforcement officials to prove a facility is “intentionally allowing” drug sells to take place.
“There’s going to be footage. There’s going to be investigations,” Chesser said. “This isn’t something that’s going to be fly by night. We’re trying to protect a very vulnerable population.”
Last week, Dr. Latonya Agard, executive director of the North Carolina Coalition to End Homelessness, shared concerns about HB 437 during a rally at the legislature to lobby for affordable housing.
“I think this is unconscionable because it places and unfair burden on those facilities to increase security, to figure out what this means, to reestablish relationships that are trustworthy within the community,” Agard said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3501-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-16 09:08:46.077403

An Inland Empire lawmaker wants to make it easier for Californians with disabilities to deal with police traffic stops, by enabling drivers to present law enforcement with special blue envelopes containing information about their vehicle and disability accommodations.
San Diego introduced a blue envelope program in 2023, and Riverside and San Bernardino rolled theirs out last year. Several East Coast states and Colorado also use blue envelopes. 
State Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh, a Redlands Republican, introduced a bill in February to expand the program throughout California.
“It provides preparation and awareness on the public safety side of it but also accommodates and eases the fear and the panic that our constituents with disabilities may have,” Ochoa Bogh said. “It deescalates the potential of police stops in our state.”
A traffic stop under the program could go something like this: an officer stops the driver and asks for identification. The driver asks to present a blue envelope, which contains copies of the driver’s license, insurance and registration, and possibly relevant information about the person’s disability.
The blue envelope signals the officer to slow down and be patient, and it makes the driver more comfortable interacting with law enforcement.
But critics have concerns about privacy and say the bill doesn’t include resources needed to make sure the program rolls out effectively.
“It would need to be a quality program, and this bill falls short,” said Beth Burt, executive director of the Autism Society Inland Empire.
Ochoa Bogh’s bill calls for the Department of Motor Vehicles to print and distribute the blue envelopes with safety and communication tips for officers and drivers. They would also provide blank spaces where drivers can write in their needs, accommodations and emergency contact information. 
The DMV would offer the blue envelopes upon request. Ochoa Bogh acknowledged some people don’t want to disclose their disabilities; no one would be required to participate. 
The bill will go to a hearing of the Senate Transportation Committee April 28.
During a traffic stop, some people with disabilities may react in ways that officers could read as signs of guilt or defiance.
For instance, Ochoa Bogh said, people with cerebral palsy may have tremors that could be misconstrued as nervous or guilty behavior. Burt said officers sometimes mistake their shaking symptoms for driving under the influence. 
People with limited verbal abilities “may take time to process the information and articulate an answer” to an officer’s questions, Ochoa Bogh said, while those with physical disabilities may take longer to get out of a vehicle. 
For drivers with autism, a traffic stop can worsen communication difficulties and exaggerate stims, which are reflexive, repetitive movements, and other anxious body language. 
Miscommunication over disabilities has led to tragedy. Last year San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Deputies shot and killed a 15-year-old Apple Valley boy who had autism, after he charged at one of them with a garden tool. News reports at the time said it was unclear if the deputies knew he had autism, but the family filed a lawsuit alleging civil rights violations.
That’s why Burt thinks a statewide blue envelope program should apply to all public safety encounters, including those involving pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders, not just traffic stops. And she said there should be training to make sure everyone is on the same page.
Officers need to learn how to communicate with people with disabilities and how to calm down tense situations, she said. People with disabilities and their families must know how to react safely during a traffic stop. And they need to know what the program does and doesn’t do.
“One of our concerns is that families will think it’s a get-out-of-jail-free program; it’s okay that I run a stoplight or get caught speeding because I have a blue envelope,” she said.
Burt said her organization worked with San Bernardino County law enforcement and the Inland Regional Center to build the county’s program, spending $50,000 to produce merchandise, including envelopes, bracelets, key chains, lanyards, stickers and seat belt covers to help people communicate about their disabilities. They also provided written materials in multiple languages.
Burt said she appreciates Ochoa Bogh’s intentions, but a successful blue envelope program takes more time and resources than her bill would provide.
“When you’ve got a good quality program, we’ve seen what it does for adults with autism and other disabilities,” she said. “They feel safe and heard, versus a free program where you would just put the envelopes out with the DMV.”
Last year Assemblymember Kate Sanchez, a Rancho Santa Margarita Republican, introduced a similar bill to create a statewide blue envelope program, which would have cost an estimated $8.3 million. That bill failed in committee. 
This time Ochoa Bogh is calling for community organizations to help cover the cost of producing and distributing the blue envelopes. She said creating a statewide system would provide consistency for people traveling with disabilities.
“This is a framework that local jurisdictions can work with and modify, so that no one is reinventing the wheel and that there is some commonality between adjacent counties,” she said. “It deescalates, it educates and empowers everybody to have a more amicable interaction.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/050622-TRAFFIC-STOP-AP-CC-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-16 09:08:46.077403

Dual enrollment courses are growing on high school and college campuses but access gaps linger, particularly for students in rural areas of California as well as for Black and Hispanic male students.


Students tap on their keyboards as a professor lectures at the front of the room. It looks like any other college course, except that it’s taking place at a high school. This year, more than 150,000 California teens are earning college credit in dual enrollment courses.
Dual enrollment offers high schoolers the chance to attend community college, typically for free, often without having to leave their campuses. By helping students tackle the college academic experience, the programs increase the likelihood that students attend college after graduating high school. 
About 80% of California’s dual enrolled high school students go on to a community college or university, compared to 66% of California 12th grade students in general, the Public Policy Institute of California found. More than a third of California’s dual enrolled students go on to attend the same community college they attended while in high school after they graduate, according to the Community College Research Center.
Many college and high school administrators have pushed to increase students’ college attainment rates, and the state has invested more than $700 million in dual enrollment, leading to a significant expansion. The number of students in these courses tripled between spring 2015 and spring 2024, according to state data. The Public Policy Institute of California found that about 30% of California’s high school graduating class of 2024 took at least one dual enrollment course. 
The growth of high schoolers is a bright spot in overall student totals at the state’s community colleges, which have struggled to fully rebound after enrollment tanked during the pandemic. However, some community college faculty have pushed back against widespread dual enrollment due to concerns about academic rigor and working conditions for educators.


Furthermore, data shows that some of California’s rural students, as well as males and students of color, don’t enroll in and complete these courses at the same rate as others. Some experts and administrators say they’re not just missing out on a couple of college credits, they’re not getting the same opportunities to envision themselves as future college students.
“When high schoolers complete these courses, they are able to fulfill requirements that help them access associate degrees and bachelor’s degrees,” said Daniel Payares-Montoya, a PPIC research associate. “The students benefit, but so do the community colleges, because it helps them enroll more students.”
Rural schools and colleges face dual enrollment hurdles 
In Siskiyou County, at the northern tip of California, the only community college serves a sprawling region that covers mountains, forests and rural towns. Although the county has a population of just 43,000, it is the fifth largest county in California by area, meaning that often the hardest part of supporting dual enrolled students isn’t the actual teaching — it’s having the right technology and transportation to reach them in the first place.
“The personal interaction is a challenge, because we have high schools that are two hours away,” said Kim Peacemaker, a counselor and dual enrollment coordinator at College of the Siskiyous. The college currently has about 230 dual enrolled high school students and about 2,390 students total, based on state data.
Peacemaker said the college has worked to make dual enrollment accessible by allowing professors to meet virtually with students in their high school classrooms. However, she added that some students don’t have reliable internet access at home for homework or tutoring. In Siskiyou County, 13.7% of households don’t have broadband internet.

California’s rural colleges generally lag behind urban colleges in dual enrollment. Kern Community College District in the southern Central Valley and the Compton Community College District near Los Angeles had the two highest percentages of high school students in 2024, at 41%  and 36%  respectively, based on state data. In comparison, 9.7% of students at College of the Siskiyous are dual enrolled high schoolers, and this drops to about 5% in some other parts of the state.
Sonya Christian, the chancellor of the California Community College system, previously led the Kern Community College District, spearheading its expansion of dual enrollment. Now, dual enrollment in the district is “one of the most successful models in the state,” Christian said in an emailed statement to CalMatters.
“I prioritized dual enrollment because I saw it as a potential pathway to increase college-going rates, accelerate degree completion and provide students — especially those in rural and low-income communities — with early exposure to college-level coursework,” Christian said in the statement.
“Everyone should do dual enrollment. It saved me time, it saved me money and it made me feel more prepared for college.”Manuel milke, san diego state student
For many high school students in the small city of Blythe, which sits along California’s border with Arizona, the only people they know with bachelor’s degrees are their teachers. That’s why Clint Cowden, the vice president of instruction and student services at Palo Verde College, said the exposure to college that dual enrollment provides these students can be transformative.
“It’s really a win-win for the community,” Cowden said.
A recent alumnus of Palo Verde College’s dual enrollment program, Manuel Milke earned his high school diploma and his associate degree simultaneously, while juggling varsity soccer and football. Now Milke, who is 19, is set to graduate in the fall from San Diego State with a bachelor’s degree in kinesiology. Milke said he chose to attend San Diego State to stay close to his family in Blythe, and aspires to work as a physical therapist somewhere nearby. 
“Everyone should do dual enrollment,” said Milke. “It saved me time, it saved me money and it made me feel more prepared for college.”
Student gaps remain in dual enrollment
As a Latino male, Milke is in the minority for dual enrollment. Based on state data, Black and Latino students are both underrepresented in dual enrollment courses. In the spring 2024 semester, 41% of dual enrollment students were male, while 56% were female. According to Payares-Montoya, these gaps in access to dual enrollment can make it so Black, Latino and male students are less likely to see higher education as an option, compared to their dual enrolled peers.

For Jesse Medrano, an 18-year-old senior at Daniel Pearl Magnet High School in the Los Angeles Unified School District, dual enrollment has provided “a good outline of what college is like.” His high school first placed him in dual enrollment in ninth grade, and since then he has taken five classes, covering topics including economics and political science.
“I didn’t have the drive to seek these courses out, so the fact that they put me in them set this standard for me, and now I’m meeting it,” said Medrano, who is Latino and plans to study accounting at Cal State Northridge. “I didn’t have the motivation, but now I do, and I’m able to succeed.”
At Compton College more than a third of the current students are still in high school, according to state data. Latino and Black students comprise 75% and 9% of dual enrollees, respectively, which are significantly higher than state averages. Keith Curry, the college’s president, said that when students of color complete dual enrollment courses, this gets them comfortable with college academics and leads to better representation at colleges and universities. 
Some faculty push back against expansion
Some community college faculty have raised concerns about the process by which dual enrollment partnerships are established, the level of readiness of high school students for college courses, and who teaches these classes. In many districts across the state, some dual enrollment courses are not taught by community college faculty, but by existing high school teachers who hold the credentials required to teach at a college level. In the Kern Community College District, about 60% of dual enrollment courses held on high school campuses are taught by high school teachers who meet the college qualifications, according to district spokesperson Norma Rojas. 
“Completion is important, but our primary responsibility is for students to learn something along the way.”tim maxwell, college of san mateo english professor
Tim Maxwell, an English professor at College of San Mateo, is a “conscientious objector” to California’s expansion of dual enrollment. Maxwell said he is concerned about what he sees as a focus to get as many students to graduate and earn college credits as quickly as possible, sacrificing college-level rigor and evaluation. 
“Completion is important, but our primary responsibility is for students to learn something along the way,” said Maxwell, who has taught community college courses for about 30 years.
Maxwell has taught creative writing courses on his college campus with several dual enrolled students, one as young as 15 years old, and he said these students are “phenomenal.” But, he added, there’s a difference between a handful of proactive high schoolers going to a community college campus and a high school classroom that “switches to a college class during fifth period.” He said he is concerned about poor working conditions for professors, primarily adjunct faculty, who have to travel to high schools and teach without the proper background or support.
“We need to resist this, and we need lawmakers who understand something about education and not just spreadsheets,” Maxwell said.
Wendy Brill-Wynkoop, the president of the Faculty Association of California Community Colleges, said dual enrollment is beneficial for students, but that she has “heard grumblings” about a need for faculty to have a more active role in setting standards and policies for dual enrollment.

While in high school in Blythe, Milke said his dual enrollment courses were generally easier than the courses he takes at San Diego State. But they still challenged him and prepared him for a college-level workload, he said.
Lawmakers work to continue growth
Several state laws have been enacted in the past decade to expand dual enrollment in California. In 2015, Assembly Bill 288 established the College and Career Access Pathways program, allowing community colleges and high schools to enter into dual enrollment partnerships. These institutions bring the courses to students, as opposed to those students having to seek them out. The state streamlined the pathways program with the passage of Assembly Bill 30 in 2019, allowing students to submit fewer forms to enroll. Assembly Bill 731, which is currently in committee, would, among other changes, increase the number of units that students in the program can take.
Based on PPIC research, students in the College and Career Access Pathways program now account for about 37% of dual enrollees. This program has a higher percentage of underrepresented students compared to other dual enrollment programs, in part because it eliminates some of the restrictions that can make it hard for schools to offer broad and barrier-free dual enrollment. 
As dual enrollment continues to expand, it increases costs to California beyond the more than $700 million that the state has already invested. That’s because both community colleges and high school districts are typically both able to receive state funding for dual enrolled students, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office.
According to the statement from Christian, state leaders are working to increase dual enrollment access by expanding partnerships between high schools and colleges.
“My vision is to make dual enrollment a standard opportunity for all California students, not just an option for a select few, increasing equitable access to higher education and workforce-aligned learning,” Christian said in the statement.
Alana Althaus-Cressman, who runs the dual enrollment program at Golden Eagle Charter School, a K-12 school in Siskiyou County, markets the program to all students, not just those who already have a record of high achievement. She studied dual enrollment access for rural students for her graduate school dissertation at Sacramento State University, and started the early college high school program at Golden Eagle Charter in 2024. Students in the program take dual enrollment courses for part of the school day, and high school courses for the rest.
“We don’t want students to think that they aren’t the type of student for this program. It’s for everybody.”alana althaus-cressman, golden eagle charter school
Althaus-Cressman said that because dual enrollment offers students a glimpse of college, it’s important that the classes aren’t only filled with students who already plan to attend college. Some high schools require minimum grade point averages or have other barriers to entry for dual enrollment, which Althaus-Cressman said can perpetuate inequalities.
The early college high school program enrolls about a third of Golden Eagle Charter’s ninth graders. Althaus-Cressman attributes this level of participation to extensive outreach, which included working with school staff to call the families of every incoming high school student to invite them to a dual enrollment orientation. 
“We don’t want students to think that they aren’t the type of student for this program,” Althaus-Cressman said. “It’s for everybody.”

CHICAGO — After nearly five days of testimony, state Sen. Emil Jones III’s federal corruption trial appeared to be nearing its end Tuesday afternoon — until the senator unexpectedly took the witness stand.

Over the last week, the jury has gotten to know Jones’ voice and mannerisms through several hours of secretly recorded footage taken by corrupt red-light camera entrepreneur-turned-cooperating witness Omar Maani in addition to a covertly taped FBI interview. Jurors have learned about Jones’ affinity for wagyu steak and New Orleans from those recordings, which captured conversations the feds characterize as having crossed the line into bribery. Prosecutors also allege the senator lied to federal agents about it.

Now, jurors would hear from the senator in real time. Taking the stand gave Jones, D-Chicago, a chance to give additional context or explanations for key moments heard on the tapes. But it also opened him up to potentially confrontational cross-examination from government lawyers.

As Jones crossed the wood-paneled courtroom to swear an oath to tell the truth during his testimony, he became the first sitting state official in nearly 20 years to testify on his own behalf in trial. Former state Rep. Patricia Bailey, D-Chicago, did the same before her 2005 conviction on felony perjury and forgery charges stemming from her use of false addresses on election documents, though hers was a bench trial with no jury to perform for.

“Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be a state senator like my father,” Jones told the jury, briefly explaining that he decided to run for the Senate after his father, former Illinois Senate President Emil Jones Jr., announced his intention to retire from his near-40-year legislative career.

The senator did not mention the heat he took when he replaced the elder Jones on the November 2008 ballot months after the primary election was over. Former president Jones has been in the courtroom most days of his son’s trial but left the Dirksen Federal Courthouse before his son took the stand Tuesday.

After finishing his associate’s degree, Jones worked for a decade in various jobs within state government, starting with “selling license plates,” he said. By the time he won his father’s Senate seat, Jones had spent nearly two years at the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity helping “small and large businesses relocate to Cook County” by taking advantage of state incentives.

In contrast to his father’s reputation, Jones has mostly flown under the radar during his time in the General Assembly. The senator didn’t land on the FBI’s radar until Jones was a decade into his role as a lawmaker — and only because he’d caught the attention of Maani, a co-founder of Chicago-based red-light camera company SafeSpeed, who began cooperating as a government witness in January 2018.

Maani had been caught bribing several public officials in connection with his red-light camera business, including Jones’ colleague, then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago. As chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, Sandoval was in a position to protect SafeSpeed from legislation the red-light camera industry viewed as potentially harmful.

And in the spring of 2019, Maani flagged a measure that Jones had introduced as one of those potentially harmful bills. Jones’ legislation called for a statewide study of red-light camera systems. The bill echoed similar proposals Jones filed for several years running, which never became law.

On Tuesday, Jones explained on the stand what he’d also said on the tapes secretly recorded by Maani and the FBI agent in 2019: That he’d become skeptical of red-light cameras after seeing the impact of the expensive tickets on his constituents while the companies made “millions and millions of dollars.”

The senator claimed he’d seen reports showing that cameras at certain intersections “could make $50,000 a day from violations.”

But he also testified that there was nuance to his criticism of the industry and came to believe that the city of Chicago’s red-light camera program was more egregious than red-light camera systems in other communities. The original 2007 law that allowed municipalities in Illinois to adopt the technology allowed Chicago to operate by its own rules but put far more state oversight on programs adopted by suburbs.

And as a representative of Illinois’ 14th Senate District, Jones was able to compare the programs between the half of his district that covers Chicago’s South Side and the other half that encompasses five of the city’s southwest suburbs.

Still, Jones’ 2019 legislation called for a study of red-light cameras everywhere in Illinois, and Maani made it his mission to talk Jones into limiting his bill to studying only the city of Chicago. After Maani brought up Jones to Sandoval during a March 2019 dinner, SafeSpeed lobbyists — who happened to be friends of Jones’ — invited the senator to a site visit and informational meeting the following month.

But on secretly recorded video of that meeting, Jones told company officials and the lobbyists that he couldn’t commit to changing his legislation.

Jones’ bill went nowhere during the remainder of the General Assembly’s spring legislative session, but at the FBI’s direction, Maani asked Sandoval to set up a dinner between himself, Sandoval and Jones.

The jury earlier Tuesday heard Jones tell FBI agents that he became wary of his meal companions’ intentions during the June 2019 dinner at a suburban steakhouse as Sandoval told Jones that Maani “wants to be your friend.”

Still, Jones agreed to two more dinners with Maani as the summer wore on. At the July dinner at yet another steakhouse, Maani pushed the senator to come up with a number that Maani could contribute to Jones’ upcoming fundraiser.

Eventually, Jones relented, telling Maani, “If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good.”

“But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office,” Jones continued. “And I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job.”

Prosecutors alleged Jones agreed to accept the $5,000 from Maani and the job for his former intern as bribes in exchange for changing his proposed legislation as Maani requested. And although the $5,000 never materialized and Jones never amended his bill, the feds say the agreement is enough to prove Jones’ “corrupt intent.”

The jury spent the morning listening to prosecutors pick apart a roughly 40-minute recording of Jones speaking to FBI agents at his home in September 2019. Special Agent Timothy O’Brien testified he and his partner told the senator they were there to ask him questions for their investigation into Sandoval — but opted to not tell Jones that they were also investigating him.

The feds allege the senator lied to agents during that interview, downplaying both his willingness to accept the $5,000 and to change his legislation. Prosecutors lingered on those parts of the interview while questioning O’Brien Tuesday morning, also pointing out that Jones told the agents he didn’t know how much his former intern, Christopher Katz, was being paid by Maani, even though they’d discussed paying him $15 an hour at a dinner 1 ½ months prior.

But while cross-examining O’Brien, Jones’ attorney Joshua Adams pointed to all the times during the recording when the senator volunteered information even before the agents told him that he’d be subject to federal charges if he hadn’t been telling the truth.

O’Brien testified that when he returned Jones’ cellphone later on Sept. 24, 2019, after it was searched at the FBI’s Chicago offices post-interview, Jones made a passing comment that he was “chewed out by his dad and his attorney for speaking to me.”

Nearly five months later, Jones sat for another interview with federal agents and a prosecutor at the Internal Revenue Services’ downtown Chicago office. The senator changed his story, agreeing with agents’ contentions that he’d made a deal with Maani to amend his legislation in exchange for a campaign contribution and a job for Katz.

Five years later, Jones will return to the witness stand Wednesday morning in a courtroom across the street from those offices and finish testifying in his own defense.

Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the House Finance Committee, in charge of the operating budget, listens to debate Monday, April 14, 2025, on the operating budget. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)For the first time in more than 25 years, the Alaska House of Representatives has voted against budget language that seeks to limit Medicaid coverage for abortions.
On Monday, the House failed by a single vote to approve a budget amendment that would forbid the state from spending money on abortions unless they are deemed a “mandatory service” under Medicaid. 
The amendment received 20 votes, all from Republicans; 21 votes were needed to approve the amendment, which has been a feature of the state budget since at least 2001. 
Hours later, the House approved a different amendment that seeks to adopt a similar approach with regard to gender dysphoria and care for transgender Alaskans. 
That amendment passed 21-19 on a strict party-line vote, as both Republican members of the House’s coalition majority joined members of the minority Republican caucus to pass it.
Both actions are not final — they would have to be mirrored by the state Senate — but nonetheless have significant symbolic value.
The Alaska House of Representatives has repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempted to restrict abortion access since the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that the privacy clause of the state constitution protects abortion rights.
Each year, under an amendment to the state budget, state lawmakers have attempted to restrict abortion under Medicaid by limiting coverage to only what’s deemed medically necessary.
Introducing the abortion amendment was Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Kodiak.
“The courts have weighed in on this issue, and it is the value and the principle of Alaskans that we preserve life,” she said. 
“The executive branch has provided support for this, the Legislature has provided support for this. So this is simply restoring the language that we have previously had,” Vance said.
The budget language has had limited practical effect because doctors need only fill out a form to demonstrate that a procedure is medically necessary, and an attempt to define what’s medically necessary was struck down in court. 
The Alaska Supreme Court ruled that using different definitions for abortion and for other cases violated the right to equal protection of the laws under the Alaska Constitution.
Nevertheless, the amendment has turned into an annual statement of intent. In 2019, the state Senate initially failed to adopt the amendment, though the final budget included language from the House. Until this year, the House had never failed to adopt the amendment.
This year’s amendment came down to Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, who initially voted in favor of the amendment but changed her mind before voting closed.
“I’m just trying to do the right thing, and putting it in the budget is the wrong thing,” Stutes said afterward. “Aside from the fact that I believe the state doesn’t belong between a woman and her doctor — and our state constitution protects that — I think the intent language, if it were enforced, it’s unconstitutional. So it’s kind of meaningless to put it in the budget.”
Hours later, Stutes and Rep. Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, the majority leader, joined 19 members of the House’s Republican minority to add similar language regarding gender dysphoria to the state budget.
If adopted by the Senate and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, it’s unclear what effect the amendment would have. Although a 2021 lawsuit resulted in a federal ruling that requires Alaska’s Medicaid program to cover gender-affirming care, the Alaska Supreme Court has not considered the issue, and the case law around the topic is not established as well as it is for abortion, experts said.
“We’re grateful that for the first time in recent memory, the House did not insert the harmful and performative amendment aimed at stripping patients with low incomes access to coverage for abortion. Unfortunately, the same body adopted an equally harmful and performative amendment attacking gender affirming health care,” said Rose O’Hara-Jolley, Alaska State Director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates. “We urge the body not to adopt either amendment in its final version — we’re relying on them to stand with all Alaskans, regardless of their income or gender identity.”

(Photo by Pete Starman/Getty Images)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone.
After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes.
Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC — the primary psychoactive component in cannabis — in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.










Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug


“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back.


SC opinions
More than three-fourths of South Carolinians support marijuana prescribed by a doctor, while 56% support recreational use.
The latter is more lopsided by party: 45% of self-identified Republicans favor legalizing recreational use, compared to 62% of self-identified Democrats, according to an April 2023 Winthrop Poll, the last that asked about marijuana.
That compares to 76% of all adults responding to an April 2015 Winthrop Poll saying marijuana should not be broadly legalized for personal use.
Source: Winthrop Poll


But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
That’s roughly in line with the latest polling in South Carolina, where marijuana remains illegal.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
In South Carolina, efforts to legalize marijuana for patients with chronic illnesses have failed repeatedly for over a decade. The idea has twice passed the state Senate but never received a vote on the House floor, with opponents arguing it would create the framework for a full-scale marijuana industry and wide-open legalization.
Medical marijuana in SC likely dead, again, as House lets clock run out

GOP Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort, who’s led the effort, has refiled legislation to try again. But his bill has yet to even get a hearing this year.
Mallinson acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers.
One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws.
The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
(In South Carolina, that’s already the case. The state constitution doesn’t allow voter-driven ballot initiatives. Only the Legislature can create laws, and it takes a supermajority approval in both chambers to put a question on ballots asking voters whether the constitution should be amended.)
In Idaho, advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel, the House minority leader.
Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
Pot smell and safety concerns ignite disputes over public smoking

“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
Trump’s support of Florida marijuana legalization may show growing bipartisan consensus

In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives passed a bill Tuesday that prohibits people from using a foreign national drivers license or ID to vote in Alabama elections.
Sponsor of  HB 480, Rep. Alan Treadaway, R-Morris, said he has heard of people using one of these IDs to vote in Alabama elections. Treadaway did not say where or how many.
“My understanding is there’s been some confusion at the polling places,” he said.
People from foreign countries with legal status in the country may apply for driver’s licenses or IDs from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency but are not authorized to vote.
House Democrats criticized the legislation saying it is unnecessary. Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, prodded Treadaway for proof that this has happened.
“I would like to know where it happens and how frequently it happens before we jump into this,” Moore said.
Rep. Laura Hall, D-Mobile, questioned the need for a law if the ID is not on the list of approved photo-IDs to vote.
“If it’s not one of them, why do we need a bill? It’s already not one of the ones you can use to vote,” Hall said.
Treadaway said the IDs have caused confusion at polling locations and the bill would clarify that one could not be used in order to vote. 
“If they have, or haven’t been used, this bill simply says they cannot be used unless they get their U.S. citizenship,” he said.
The bill passed 76-5, with 21 abstentions. It goes to the Senate.

Bills and resolutions had to pass out of a committee by Friday, which marked day 68 of the 120-day session; 281 did not. The remainder of the bills either did advance or are exempt from the deadlines.
Among the most high profile to die on Friday: a proposal to amend the Nevada Constitution to allow for a state lottery. Assembly Joint Resolution 5 was passed by the 2023 Legislature and needed to be passed by the 2025 Legislature in order to advance to the 2026 General Election ballot for final approval by voters. It was not given a hearing before Friday’s deadline.
The lottery proposal was pushed by Culinary Union, which on Monday issued a statement deriding Democratic leadership for not giving the resolution a hearing this session.
“With federal cuts looming, uncertainty around the state budget, and lack of funding for education and mental health, Nevadans need real solutions and we need it now,” Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement. “Politicians cannot complain about budget shortfalls while refusing to even consider a bill that would bring in new revenue.”
A second bill being pushed by Culinary, Senate Bill 360, also died Friday. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo had said he would veto the bill if it made it to his desk, and the bill would have faced significant resistance in the Legislature anyway.
Dubbed the Hotel Safety Act, SB360 was sponsored by state Sen. Lori Rogich, a Republican who Culinary endorsed over a Democratic incumbent in last year’s general election. Culinary had previously endorsed the incumbent, Dallas Harris, but withdrew support for her and other Democrats after they voted against a similar room cleaning proposal in 2023. (Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, who sponsored the lottery resolution, was also “unendorsed.”)
Another high-profile bill that died Friday was Senate Bill 415, which would have allowed local jurisdictions to use automated traffic enforcement cameras. The more sweeping of two red light camera bills introduced this session, SB415 was considered problematic by civil rights groups like the ACLU of Nevada.
The second red light camera bill, Democratic Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett’s Assembly Bill 402, is still alive. That bill is exempt from standard deadlines but cleared the Assembly Growth and Infrastructure Committee last week. It would authorize traffic monitoring cameras in construction work zones when workers are present.
Opponents of automated red light cameras say they will continue monitoring bills to see if lawmakers attempt to amend parts of SB415 into other bills, including AB402.
“The deployment of red-light cameras is often framed as a matter of public safety, but in reality, most civil liberties abuses happen under the guise of public safety,” said ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah in a statement Monday.
Two bills sponsored on behalf of the Nevada Highway Patrol also failed to advance. Assembly Bill 54 would have subjected a driver to a felony if they failed to move over for an emergency services provider and that resulted in the death of a first responder. The bill received a hearing but was not passed out of committee.
A second Nevada Highway Patrol proposal, Senate Bill 37 would have criminalized road rage. It never received a hearing.
Other bills and resolutions the Nevada Current has covered that are now dead:

Assembly Joint Resolution 6, sponsored by 27 Democrats. The resolution, which passed in 2023 but needed to be passed once more by the Legislature and then by voters, would have had Nevada enter the National Popular Vote Compact, an interstate agreement wherein states commit to allocating their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the national popular vote. AJR6 was not given a hearing by the Senate Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections.
Assembly Bill 33, sponsored by Republican State Controller Andy Matthews. The bill would have established a Nevada Inspector General. Described by some as having “DOGE vibes,” the bill was heard by the Assembly Government Affairs Committee but no action was taken.
 Assembly Bill 141, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Duy Nguyen. The bill would have required judicial candidates to have participated in at least 10 trials. The bill received a poor reception in the Assembly Judiciary Committee during its hearing and no action was taken.
Senate Bill 242, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Edgar Flores. The bill would have prohibited investment companies from purchasing residential properties unless they have been listed on the market for at least 30 days. The bill never received a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but other attempts to rein in corporate ownership of single-family homes did move forward.
Assembly Bill 129, sponsored by Republican Assemblymember Jill Dickman, and Senate Bill 221 and Senate Bill 222, sponsored by Republican state Sen. Carrie Ann Buck. This trio of homeowners association bills died without receiving hearings, but at least half a dozen other HOA-focused bills have advanced.

Of course, nothing is ever truly dead in the Legislature. For proof of that, just look to Assembly Bill 381, dubbed Reba’s Law, which mandates prison time for killing a domestic animal. Sponsored by Republican Assemblymember Melissa Hardy, the bill failed to advance out of committee by Friday’s committee deadline only to be posthumously given a waiver and advanced on Monday.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20230123_NVSoS_1717-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 08:07:02.026799

It could stop a probe of our governor.,"Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, seen here in 2024 with President Donald Trump, said she's investigating New Jersey's governor and attorney general over their refusal to allow state and local cops to assist with civilian immigration enforcement. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba has a big hurdle to climb in her alleged pursuit of an investigation into our governor and attorney general: the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Habba said she’s pursuing a probe of Gov. Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which bars law enforcement from becoming de facto immigration agents in the Trump administration’s mass deportation push.
But legal experts told me the Tenth Amendment — which says “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people” — has long been recognized as one that protects states against intrusions by the federal government. Intrusions like, say, conscripting local cops in a federal push to detain and deport undocumented immigrants.
Conservative hero U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a 1997 decision that, under the Tenth Amendment, the federal government “is one of enumerated, hence limited, powers.”
Concerns about protecting the division of authority between an overly powerful federal government, particularly when it comes to criminal justice policy, is a longtime concern of well-regarded jurists appointed by conservative and Republican presidents, according to Jenny-Brooke Condon, who teaches law at Seton Hall University.
“I think Justice O’Connor and Justice Scalia were long critics of an overly powerful federal government and protective of states’ rights and strong advocates for robust Tenth Amendment protections,” Condon said.
This might be an area of the law Habba should study.
I wrote last week about my doubt that there is any such investigation. Habba, a loyalist to President Donald Trump, has learned from her boss that it’s easier to issue a dramatic threat than to follow through on one.
But if Habba proceeds with her probe of Murphy and Platkin, she’ll have to contend with decades of court precedent on the limits of federal power. Steve Wasserman, a retired public defender and an adjunct associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the question of whether states can opt out of assisting with immigration enforcement is a difficult one. But he noted that the 1997 case, called Printz v. United States, could back up Murphy and Platkin here.
In that case, county sheriffs in Montana and Arizona objected to a requirement in the federal gun control measure called the Brady bill that local chief law enforcement officers perform background checks on prospective gun owners. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court found that the 10th Amendment bars the federal government from compelling local officials to fulfill federal tasks.
“They said that the Constitution does not require the state officials to allow themselves to be conscripted by the feds in order to enforce the federal law. It’s a principle of autonomy, that state and local officials are not subordinate to the feds,” Wasserman said.
Ron Chen, who teaches law at Rutgers Law School, said he thinks former Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, whose office drafted the Immigrant Trust Directive, probably studied the 10th Amendment and relevant case law before issuing the order.
Chen cited the “anti-commandeering doctrine,” which emerged in the Printz case and an earlier one, New York v. United States in 1992. In the New York case, the court ruled 6-3 (with Justice Thomas on the winning side again) that the federal government cannot “‘commandeer’ states into the service of federal regulatory purposes.”
“Presumably Ms. Habba disagrees with that decision, but if so, her efforts might be better directed at asking the courts to reconsider, rather than announcing that she is ‘opening an investigation.’  Indeed, I am not sure there is much to investigate here, since the state’s policy has been a matter of public record for some time,” Chen said.

Earlier this month, the Esmeralda County Board of Commissioners approved a development agreement with Ioneer that […]","Goldfield is the county seat in Esmeralda County. (Photo: Sydney Martinez/Travel Nevada)Esmeralda County has secured an agreement with lithium developer Ioneer that will bring the rural county at least $15 million in funding to mitigate the impacts of a massive planned mine in the least populated county in the state.
Earlier this month, the Esmeralda County Board of Commissioners approved a development agreement with Ioneer that will provide the county with at least $5 million in funding for emergency services and more than $10 million for road improvements and maintenance. 
The seven year development agreement is meant to “reasonably mitigate the land use impacts that the development” of Ioneer’s 7,000 acre Rhyolite Ridge Lithium-Boron Project “will have on the citizens of Esmeralda County.”
Esmeralda County is the least populated county in Nevada, a fact reflected by the county’s infrastructure and services. The county is built to support the roughly 750 residents who live there, but if the projected 500 construction jobs it will take to build the lithium mine is accurate, that influx alone would nearly double the county’s population within a couple of years.
  Ioneer’s Rhyolite Ridge lithium mine is in the Silver Peak Range in Esmeralda County near the state line with California. (BLM map)
Under the agreement, Ioneer will reimburse Esmeralda County for the cost of three sheriff’s deputies and six emergency services staffers, including salary and insurance and retirement and benefit costs. Esmeralda County will also be reimbursed for three converted patrol vehicles, one fire truck, and one ambulance under the agreement.
“Ioneer’s investments will make for a safer and more secure Esmeralda County,” said County Fire Chief Jeffrey Bushnell in a press release Monday. “We’re grateful for their financial support and look forward to our continued partnership for the many years that follow.”
The agreement is in the final stages of approval with the county. A signed copy of the agreement will be posted once finalized, according to county officials. 
“Ioneer has embraced our entire community, welcoming our input. They have left no stone unturned in a quest for a fair and harmonious development agreement,” said Mary Jane Zakas, Esmeralda County Commissioner for District 3 in a statement.
For years, county officials have raised concerns about how the largest development project in the county in the last 22 years would require significant investments from the county to expand law enforcement, emergency services, and waste disposal.  The county will also need to take on higher maintenance expenses for the wear-and-tear on roads carrying heavy machinery, a concern reiterated by county commissioners last year during the project environmental review period. 
Those impacts will now be partially mitigated by the development agreement which is designed to “promote the health, safety and general welfare” of Esmeralda County residents while ensuring the “highest economic benefit and least fiscal cost to its citizens,” according to the agreement.
Dyer, a small town about 13 miles from the proposed lithium mine, would likely face the brunt of the impacts from the project. 
State Highway 264 and other transportation routes through the town of Dryer would be used to transport hazardous materials and hundreds of diesel fuel vehicles a day to and from the mine, according to the environmental review.
Under the development agreement, Ioneer would be required to prepare and deliver an emergency response plan to the county before the company starts transporting or storing hazardous materials on the project site, including truckloads of boric acid needed to mine lithium. 
Ioneer would also be required to pay up to $25,000 annually for emergency response and fire protection training as soon as the company begins delivering equipment for construction of the mine.
The increase of emergency services needed to accommodate mining operations also calls for an emergency facility to house the additional emergency workers the county plans to hire, according to the development agreement. Ioneer will be required to pay up to $900,000 for the construction of an emergency facility near the intersection of State Highway 264 and State Highway 773. 
Water and conservation
Lithium extraction requires massive amounts of water, a tough sell in a state plagued by two decades of drought. Ioneer plans to source water from Esmeralda County’s Fish Lake Valley, where the groundwater supply is already over-appropriated and over-pumped. Over the past 50 years agriculture has reduced groundwater in Fish Lake Valley by up to 200 feet in some areas, drying up residential wells.
The agreement acknowledges the need for groundwater mitigation by establishing a county-administered program to help residents in the region who need domestic water wells drilled deeper or rehabilitated.
However, the program would only be funded if Esmeralda County secures grants to fund the jobs and associated costs that Ioneer would have covered under the agreement. In that scenario, Ioneer would get paid back the costs in annual payments and half that money would be set aside for the well digging program.
County officials have also raised concerns about the costs of expanding waste disposal services to accommodate the boom in workers needed to construct the mine. 
The agreement addressed that concern by noting that Ioneer will reimburse the county for the cost of a garbage truck if the volume of household waste increases to the point where another is needed.
“We are dedicated to being good neighbours, providing the County with the necessary resources to ensure that our funding assists the County and services it provides in preparation for the commencement of project construction,” said Bernard Rowe the Managing Director of Ioneer in a statement Monday.
Federal land managers gave their final approval for the mine in October, after a four year federal permitting and environmental review process. Ioneer also secured a $996 million federal loan in January to fund the mine processing facilities and associated infrastructure. 
However, the project was hit with a financial setback in February when South African mining company Sibanye-Stillwater pulled back plans to invest $490 million in Ioneer for a 50 percent stake in the project following cratering lithium prices.
Despite the setback, Ioneer said Rhyolite Ridge is construction ready and the company is currently focused on seeking a new equity partner to bring the project into production.
Once constructed the massive 7,000 acre project would be in operation for 23 years and remove enough lithium from Nevada’s public lands to supply nearly 370,000 electric vehicles each year. 
The project has also attracted fierce opposition from conservation groups opposed to the mine’s encroachment on critical habitat reserved for the only known population of the endangered wildflower Tiehm’s buckwheat. The flower grows on just 10 acres of lithium-boron rich soil near the Silver Peak Range in Esmeralda County.
A week after the federal government approved the mine, the Center for Biological Diversity initiated a lawsuit against the mine under the Endangered Species Act.
If constructed, the mine would create a 66 acre quarry — a deep open pit characteristic of mines and where the lithium would be extracted — and directly disturb about 191 acres of critical habitat for the Tiehm’s buckwheat. In total the mine would result in the removal of more than 2,000 acres of nesting sites and foraging habitat for a number of species.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Goldfield-cropped.jpg,,,2025-04-16 10:02:49.064037

This year, marijuana advocates are playing defense in multiple state legislatures. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.
“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

Ellison agrees with his interlocutors that state agencies are discriminating against East African vendors, saying “we are in the middle of the battle with the agencies now.” 
Most distressing is who Ellison is talking to: individuals ensnared in the massive Feeding Our Future scandal that drained at least $250 million from a program intended to help hungry children — but was instead spent on fancy cars, real estate, jewelry and foreign travel. 
The conversation, which was recorded by the Feeding Our Future participants and entered into evidence during a recent trial, took place in December 2021, just a month before the FBI executed a bevy of search warrants. The investigation led to charges against 70 people, with 38 pleading guilty and seven convicted at trial so far. More charges could be coming. 
In the audio, Ellison seems genuinely oblivious to the investigation, as the people — one of them eventually convicted, another awaiting trial —  lobby him to keep the money flowing. The Minnesota Department of Education had halted payments flagged as suspicious, but a judge ordered the agency to resume payments.  
His ignorance about what was happening offers some bizarre comfort — at least he wasn’t aware of the fraud — though it’s also disquieting that he was so uninformed, especially since his office had defended the Department of Education in trying to put a stop to the suspicious spending.  
Ellison isn’t the only elected official who offered his ear to future fraudsters. That’s what’s so striking about the case, though it’s often overlooked: The perpetrators had political ties to influential Democrats. 
Listen to Aimee Bock, the mastermind of the Feeding Our Future fraud who was convicted last month of all seven counts, including wire fraud and federal programs bribery: “Political leaders have been watching the way (the Department of Education) is treating Feeding Our Future and, more importantly, the communities we serve,” Bock said in an interview with the Star Tribune in early 2022. “And they have been intervening and asking the questions that needed to be asked.”
In other words, this convicted fraudster alleges that she used her juice with politicians to get them to lean on bureaucrats who were trying to put a stop to the fraud.   
State Sen. Omar Fateh said in June 2021 — at a party to celebrate Feeding Our Future’s legal victory over the Department of Education — that the pressure tactic was paying off: “What I can tell you is that leadership hears you. Folks at the Capitol hear you. The pressure is really on, and … it’s working.”
With Bock finally convicted, Minnesotans should brush up on how the scandal’s tentacles have touched elected officials. 
Attorney General Keith Ellison
Until last week, there wasn’t much reason to include Ellison on this list of elected officials. His office represented MDE when the agency tried to put the brakes on the millions going out to Feeding Our Future. And once the federal government intervened, the investigation was theirs. 
But the audio reveals something new: Ellison seemed to have no idea about a huge fraud perpetrated on the state of Minnesota and the United States government. Even though his office represented one of the agencies defrauded when Feeding Our Future sued the Department of Education to turn the money spigot back on. 
Moreover, during the 54-minute conversation, he seemed to be commiserating with these strangers about the state agencies he ostensibly represents, and seemed to agree that the agencies were discriminating against immigrant-owned businesses. 
He told them that he had a recent conversation with Jodi Harpstead — at the time the commissioner of the Department of Human Services — telling her to go easier on state contractors: “You’re running small, tiny businesses out of business over nothing.” 
Although we can’t know for sure what was said in that meeting with Harpstead, the commissioner had reason to be focused on program compliance. 
In fact, Ellison’s own office was investigating a boatload of Medicaid fraud in what was known as PIT Stop. The defendants in the case are alleged to have used the identities of hundreds of Somali Minnesotans to fraudulently schedule and bill for provider, interpreter and transportation services that were never provided.
And if Harpstead wasn’t focused on fraud in the state’s rapidly growing autism program, she should have been. When FBI agents served search warrants on two autism centers last year, they alleged “substantial evidence that many of these companies have been submitting fraudulent claims for (autism) services that were not actually provided or that were not covered.”
Why were they investigating autism providers, as the Reformer first reported last year? Because some Feeding Our Future fraudsters were also running autism treatment facilities. 
We’ve listened to the recording, and Ellison’s role isn’t as nefarious as Republicans have insinuated the past week. After all, the fraudsters’ attempt to lobby him wasn’t fruitful. The FBI conducted the raids a month later, and dozens of people have been convicted since. Ellison also received a pile of campaign donations after the meeting; during the meeting, however, he brushes off their talk about campaign funds more than once.  
You can listen to the full recording here. 
Mostly, Ellison just sounds credulous and clueless about what would seem to be an important case for his office. Which is starkly at odds with what he sought to portray when he was running in a tight reelection battle a year later; his office put out a lengthy statement: “For two years, Attorney General Ellison’s office has been holding Feeding Our Future accountable.”
In answers to some questions from the Reformer, Ellison’s office maintains the recorded meeting was an ambush that left him bereft of his usual preparation: “AG Ellison was asked to sit down with a friend that day, Imam Mohamed Omar. When the AG arrived, he was surprised to find others present but agreed to meet with them. It is a shame that these fraudsters tried to exploit the Attorney General’s good faith engagement, but they were not successful. Nothing happened as a result of the meeting.” 
Ellison’s office says after the meeting, he had a conversation with his staff working on the Feeding Our Future case, which got him up to speed, and that was the end of it.  
Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman*
At the June 2021 Feeding Our Future celebration, Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman boasted that he introduced a resolution urging the Minnesota Department of Education to allow minority and low-income communities to participate in the federal meals program. 
“I’m one of those people that push back and call it what it is. Which is racist tactics,” Osman said, smearing MDE employees. The Star Tribune, through a public records request, discovered that the resolution Osman sought to introduce was sent to him by Bock via Abdi Salah, then a policy aide to Mayor Jacob Frey. 
The 6th Ward Democrat’s involvement in Feeding Our Future, it turns out, was extensive. During the same time that Osman was lobbying MDE, Osman’s wife was operating a meal site, which claimed to feed 2,500 children a day and was reimbursed more than $460,000. 
Osman’s wife’s nonprofit was later shut down by none other than Ellison because it was found to have been created for “the purpose of directing funds to herself, her family members, and her co-conspirators.” (She has not been charged for her role in the case.)
Two months after Osman was sworn in after winning a special election in August 2020, he transferred a nonprofit he had incorporated called Stigma-Free International to individuals who then used it to steal millions meant to feed hungry children, according to federal prosecutors. 
We sent him a text and email with some questions, like, why did you transfer control of the nonprofit? And, did you know your wife was running a meal site? And, what have you learned from all this? Osman, who is running for reelection, didn’t respond.
Sen. Omar Fateh
In June 2021, the Minneapolis Democrat, who is now a leading candidate for mayor, was effusive in his praise for the now convicted fraudster Bock. “I want to thank Aimee and her team at Feeding Our Future for making this first court victory a reality,” he said. 
The fraud went on for another eight months or so until the FBI raided a number of businesses and nonprofits that were running phony meal sites. 
During the recent Feeding Our Future trial, a witness testified that Fateh had also reached out to Ellison’s office in an effort to get them to back off. 
Fateh says on the June 2021 video that the problem of the persnickety bureaucrats extends beyond just Feeding Our Future. 
“MDE, DHS whether it’s a Democratic administration or Republican administration. Folks who own group homes and home cares. They see this as an ongoing pattern.” 
Later, Fateh sought to keep up the pressure on the bureaucrats to keep the money train moving.
In December 2021, just weeks before the FBI raid, Fateh spoke at the 1st Annual Somali American Elected Officials Town Hall and alleged that MDE, MDH, and DHS were “consistently targeting” immigrant businesses.
In a statement to the Reformer, Fateh said he heard from constituents about payment delays to government contractors enrolled in the food program. 
“As a senator, I did my due diligence and reached out to the Department of Education; at no time did I advocate on behalf of a specific provider or organization. In my conversations with the administration, I was repeatedly told they did not suspect fraud was occurring,” he said. 
He added: “As we now know, some of the providers were lying to me, and have since been tried and convicted of crimes. I am furious about the theft of public funds, the damage to community, and most of all, the depriving of the children and families who were supposed to receive support during a pandemic.”
Fateh pointed to the 2023 legislative session, when lawmaker created an inspector general at the Department of Education and put accountability measures in place for state grants. He said going forward he’d “make sure funds and programs are reaching the people who need them.”  
Gov. Tim Walz
Walz’s Departments of Education and Human Services sent hundreds of millions of dollars out the door to people who stole it. 
His own Department of Education, represented by Ellison’s office, did try to stop payments to the fraudsters, though it was such a failed effort that the judge in the case found MDE in contempt. 
At various times, Walz has acknowledged the scope of the problem and tried to reassure Minnesotans that he gets it. 
When he proposed a slew of anti-fraud measures in January, he said the theft of public dollars had angered him: “It’s maddening and it makes Minnesotans and myself angry about this.”
At other times, he’s seemed uninformed. 
When a reporter asked him in December about concerns about fraud in the autism program, he seemed caught unawares. 
“We always investigate it and those people go to jail.” Except there’s been no charges yet. 
The number of Minnesota providers who diagnose and treat people with autism spectrum disorder increased 700% in five years, while the amount paid to providers during that time increased 3,000%, from about $6 million to nearly $192 million — according to data provided to the Reformer by the Minnesota Department of Human Services last year. 
Not long after Walz’s confused statement, the FBI executed the search warrants on an autism center in Minneapolis and another in St. Cloud. 
Ellison says during the newly unveiled taped conversation from 2021 that Walz concurred with him about his own agencies. 
“Walz agrees with me that this piddly stupid stuff running small people out of business is terrible,” Ellison tells the group. 
A Walz spokeswoman told the Reformer that since 2021, the “administration has implemented dozens of oversight measures, created a statewide fraud investigation unit, and asked the Legislature to pass his plan to prevent, detect and penalize fraud.” 
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who is running for reelection, had a meeting with the Minnesota Department of Education in 2021 to talk about Feeding Our Future, after the agency had stopped payments to get a handle on the program’s fantastical growth. The point of the meeting was to browbeat MDE Commissioner Heather Mueller and get the agency to resume payments.  
The talking points for the meeting were prepared by none other than Bock. 
Frey told the Star Tribune that he had never met Bock, and that her talking points were delivered to him via his then-policy aide Abdi Salah. 
And who is Salah? He pleaded guilty earlier this year. Frey fired him shortly after the feds seized property he had invested in with his ill-gotten Feeding Our Future gains. 
Frey’s office didn’t respond to a Reformer request for comment. 
Coda
The frauds perpetrated on the state of Minnesota the past few years have been consequential. Money that should have gone to people who needed it wound up enriching people who didn’t. Just as important, these episodes have surely eroded Minnesotans’ trust in government programs, which will make life harder for people who need help.  
Let’s hope the experience has been educational for elected officials, now and in the future.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Eleven mostly rural counties will lose judges under a bill passed 33-16 by the Indiana Senate Tuesday.
House Bill 1144 — which adds judges and magistrates in Elkhart, Hamilton, Lawrence and Vigo counties — has moved through the entire session without language abolishing courts.
Then, on April 10, hours before a committee deadline, an amendment was added in the Senate Appropriations Committee eliminating one court each in Blackford, Carroll, Gibson, Greene, Jennings, Monroe, Newton, Owen, Pulaski, Rush and Scott counties, along with six juvenile magistrate positions in Marion County.
This provision is estimated to save the state approximately $748,885 in Fiscal Year 2027 and up to $2.75 M in Fiscal Year 2032, according to a fiscal analysis.
  Sen. Jean Leising, R-Oldenburg, speaks on a bill on April 15, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Sen. Jean Leising, R-Oldenburg, said constituents in her district were shocked by the move.
“That created quite a frenzy from the people that maybe should have been expecting it. I don’t know, but they weren’t expecting it,” she said.
Leising tried unsuccessfully to add her judges back into the bill on Monday. She voted against the proposal.
She said she knows the courts were chosen based on caseload statistics but she wished the list had been made public earlier in the process.
“I would just hope that in the future when things like this are done that maybe it was a more open process so those counties can come speak up,” Leising said. “If a county now has two judges and you do away with one of them, it’s a tremendous impact.”
The general idea of reallocation was discussed in a study committee in October 2024. Essentially, Indiana uses a weighted caseload study that assesses how much judicial time is needed for different types of cases. Then it looks at how many cases are filed to determine how many judges and magistrates are needed for the caseload.
For years lawmakers have added state-funded court officers when the statistics have shown more judges are needed to handle additional cases. But as population has shifted away from some rural counties, they have never taken a judge away — even if the weighted caseload shows they have too many court officers.
Sen. Liz Brown said every two years the study committee looks at the need for court officers when lawmakers are crafting a new state budget. That’s because the state pays for the salaries of judges and magistrates — currently about $183,000 and $146,000, respectively.

“At the same time we looked at where there is not a need in the state,” she said. “I want to assure you that this was not done with any sense of personality … this is strictly where is the need in the state of Indiana.”
Brown said “courts that are losing a judge, we looked at them on their own, independently, and said there is not sufficient need here.”
The weighted caseload study shows, for instance, that Monroe County has ten judges but only needs 7.87. Blackford County has two judges but the study shows it needs less than one.
The bill now goes back to the House, where court abolishments were not originally part of the measure. That chamber can either accept the changes or send the bill to conference committee for final negotiations.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Last week, my best friend, who lives in South Florida, was explaining the hellscape that undocumented immigrants have been forced to endure since Gov. Ron DeSantis – in his slavish devotion to nastiness and cruelty – mimicked the federal government and called a special session in which the Republican-dominated Legislature passed a law that would further punish them.
DeSantis has savaged lawmakers for not doing enough to support President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to detain and deport as many as 20 million undocumented immigrants. He has worked assiduously to engineer Florida’s reactionary version of “how many ways can we screw over immigrants?”
In addition, DeSantis announced in February that the Florida Highway Patrol, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and the Florida State Guard had entered into agreements to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement round up migrants.
Immigration-rights activists and lawyers report that ICE agents have set up checkpoints, raided people’s homes, and showed up unannounced at construction sites, grocery stores, immigration hearings, and a range of public places where immigrants — with and without papers — hang out.
An assortment of once-safe spaces where men, women, and children congregate are now danger zones. So far, agents haven’t been allowed to invade hospitals or churches.
At any moment, ICE and/or cops deputized by ICE can stop someone under a dubious pretext and demand proof that they are in the state and country legally.
While state and city officials claim that enforcement actions are focused on undocumented immigrants, these actions will have ripple effects across millions more people living in immigrant families, including U.S.-born citizen children, the Kaiser Family Foundation says.
According to its data, as of 2023 47.1 million immigrants lived in the United States, including 22.4 million non-citizens, of whom the Pew Research Center estimates 11 million are undocumented.
There are other immigrants whose lawful status is at risk if they lose temporary protection status (TPS), which many of them are under Trump. That includes almost 1.2 million immigrants who either have or are eligible for TPS, the more than 530,000 active DACA recipients, and people in the country with pending asylum cases.
Millions of others living in immigrant families also are likely to be affected, KFF said.
“Many undocumented immigrants live in families with mixed immigration statuses that may include people with lawful status and U.S. citizens,” researchers said. “As of 2023, 19 million, or one-in-four children in the U.S., had an immigrant parent, including one in ten (12%) who are citizen children with a non-citizen parent.”
Meanwhile, about 4.4 million U.S.-born children live with an undocumented immigrant parent.
 ‘People are afraid’
I talked to Thomas Kennedy of the Florida Immigration Coalition, a grassroots movement that includes community organizations, farmworkers, youth, advocates, lawyers, and union members.
“We’re seeing or have heard of checkpoints in Gadsden County,” he said. “In South Florida, we’re seeing heavily armed agents carrying semi-automatic weapons, involved in specific pickup/raid operations, mainly at people’s homes.”
Kennedy — who said both he and his parents have been undocumented at some point — reported that immigrant communities are awash with fear.
“People are afraid, worried, preoccupied. But they still have to do the day-to-day. Most people are resilient, trying to navigate the maze,” said Kennedy. “Cops are acting as immigration, asking for papers. Theoretically, they need to have some sort of reason to make a stop. Traffic violations are easy. People can be stopped for loitering or suspicion of some type.
“It wasn’t great before but it’s getting worse.”
Kennedy recounted the case of a University of Florida student here on student visa studying Food Resource Economics who was picked up by ICE because of expired tags.
“Now he’s at Krome,” Kennedy said when we spoke in a week ago. Felipe Zapata-Velásquez has subsequently been deported to Colombia.
None of what we are seeing in the immigration crackdown sphere is new, Kennedy reminds us.
He said a group of activists have met and protested at the ICE/Miramar Processing Center since 2017, where unmarked vehicles leave and come back on Wednesdays full of undocumented men, women, and children.
Advocates are fighting back with lawsuits, protests in Tallahassee and points across Florida, as well as engaging in other forms of civil disobedience and opposition to these tactics, but DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier have threatened lawsuits against those who resist while also threatening to withhold state funds from offending municipalities.
Fort Myers is a case-in-point.
The City Council there voted against but then voted in favor of an ICE agreement (it had failed on a tie vote) — the about-face coming three days after Uthmeier sent a letter warning that DeSantis could remove councilmembers from office unless they approved the agreement, whereby the federal government deputizes Ft. Myers police officers to act as immigration enforcement.
“We were never told this vote could expose us to becoming labeled as a sanctuary city despite the city’s continued lawful cooperation with ICE. That omission is critical to the lack of efficacy that we were displayed,” council member Darla Bonk said during a recent meeting.
Under the 287(g) federal-state task force model, city police officers receive training allowing them to question people about their immigration status and detain them if they are subject to deportation.
 ‘Cruelty’
Floridians for Immigrant Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union assert that “Florida’s anti-immigrant laws that weaponize programs against lawfully present immigrants and their families, separate families, harm DREAMERS, require local resources to be spent on enforcing immigration law, must be ended.
“Cruelty is not an immigration policy. Policies that make Florida a ‘show your papers’ state are un-democratic and do not align with our values.”
Representatives from both organizations note that one out of every five people in Florida was born outside the United States, making the state one of the most diverse in our country.
“It is critical that every single person in our state is able to live, work and travel without fear of violence, harassment and discrimination. As a state with a vibrant and unique immigrant community, we must ensure the movement for immigrant justice is a reality in Florida,” they say.
Further, the activists argue, “local governments should decide how local resources are spent and local law enforcement should spend their time serving local communities — not enforcing federal immigration law.
Policies like SB 168 — approved in 2019 to outlaw “sanctuary cities” in Florida and requiring local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE — and new laws passed this spring requiring cops to perform street-level immigration enforcement — contribute to a climate of fear and demonization of immigrants.
These laws will tear families apart; further weaken trust in law enforcement by encouraging racial and ethnic profiling; endanger communities by discouraging victims and witnesses from reporting crime; and waste taxpayer money by forcing local police to do ICE’s job at taxpayer expense.
A larger question Floridians should be asking is: Who are we as a state? What are our values? What do we stand for? And what do we want as Floridians and Americans?
DeSantis and his culture war crusaders are on the front foot and have capitalized on their recent success with a firehose of legislation, policies, lies, and bullying. But those opposed to his cruel, reckless assault on immigrants have to fight back.
“Now they are empowered,” Kennedy said of DeSantis’ ramped-up anti-immigrant campaign. “It’s extremely concerning with law enforcement’s involvement. It’s costly, a liability, and affects public safety. Most cops don’t want to be ICE, but some will abuse it.”

Mike Kehoe’s longevity raise plan in full and sets up a showdown between two powerful lawmakers over earmarked projects for their districts.
To get the bills to the full Senate, appropriations staff will have to overcome or work around a faulty new software system that crashed Tuesday while the Senate Appropriations Committee took a lunch break. Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield, said staff would use spreadsheets to track changes that were lost when the $100 million system malfunctioned.
He also cut $13 million from the Office of Administration, which signed off on the software system, to show his anger with the problems.
Despite the difficulties, the committee on Tuesday finished amending nine of the 13 budget bills that pay for the day-to-day operations of state government. When passed in the House, the 13 bills proposed spending just under $48 billion.
For public schools, the Senate plan will include almost $300 million more than recommended by Kehoe in his January budget proposal or the Missouri House was willing to spend. The money will fully fund the state foundation formula by matching the state adequacy target — how much high-performing districts spend per student.
The foundation formula was given $3.7 billion for the current year with an adequacy target of $6,760. The calculation made in 2023 shows it should be $7,145 for the coming year.
“I’ve been very, very on the record in a number of ways, saying that if we’re going to pass legislation, and we know that there’s costs associated with it, we’re going to pay the bill when it comes due,” Hough said.
The budget actions taken Tuesday did not include many offsetting cuts large enough to cover the $300 million item. One possible cut that would provide a portion of the money was not discussed Tuesday.
Kehoe requested — and the House endorsed — $50 million in general revenue to expand a scholarship program for private school students called MoScholars that is supposed to be funded from donations and tax credits. 
The money would be spent in the state Treasurer’s budget, where MoScholars program is housed. That budget will be discussed Wednesday and Hough would not say what he intended to do.
The move to spend more on public schools is sure to win support among Democrats, and many Republicans have said they feel the same as Hough. Kehoe in January said he would establish a bipartisan commission to study the current formula.
State Sen. Karla May, a Democrat from St. Louis, said she welcomes the additional funding but feels it is not enough. The most recent changes to the formula were designed to reduce its cost.
“We’ve got to figure out for our state, you know, what is the actual cost to educate our students?” May said in an interview after the committee adjourned. “We want a very intelligent Missouri, and we’ve got to figure that out for every school district.”
The committee also included $107 million Kehoe requested in new federal funding for child care to revise how providers are paid. Instead of being paid based on attendance at the end of a month, providers would get their money at the beginning of the month based on the number of children enrolled.
The current system, where payment comes at the end of the month based on days of attendance for each child, has been plagued by missed and delayed reimbursements since a new software program was launched.
Other changes to the budget Wednesday include:

Increasing the base funding for each college and university by 3% rather than the 1.5% recommended by Kehoe and approved in the House. The Senate budget plan cuts $28 million the House approved for one-time maintenance needs.
Restoring Kehoe’s full longevity pay plan of a 1% raise for every two years of state employment, capped at a 10% raise. The House had cut the plan in half, allowing 1% for every two years up to 10 years.
Diverting federal highway aid from the State Road Fund to a new Federal Road Fund. The move would reduce by hundreds of millions of dollars the funds under the direct control of the Highways and Transportation Commission and mirrors a change mandated by legislation that passed the Senate this week.

The committee will finish its work Wednesday, Hough said as the panel adjourned. The remaining spending bills allocate money for the state health, mental health and social services departments as well as the judiciary, elected officials and the General Assembly.
Committee staff will be given a week to produce revised bills that can be debated, with the week starting April 29 set aside for debate by the full Senate, Hough said.
Just before the committee began meeting, the Missouri House gave first-round approval to three additional spending bills for construction and maintenance projects. There were few changes in the bills that spend almost $4 billion and include 45 new earmarked items.
About half of that amount is in a bill using American Rescue Plan Act funds and state revenue for projects approved in previous years. 
All spending bills must be approved by May 9.
Including the three capital appropriation bills, the House added 148 earmarked items costing $289 million, all but $27.5 million coming from general revenue. In the rapid-fire run through budget lines, Hough announced cuts from House earmarks and the addition of Senate items, cutting and spending amounts that could not be tracked as fast as he spoke.
The House Budget Committee releases a list of proposed changes as it begins the amending session. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not provide a master list for the assembled department officials and staff, lobbyists and reporters who watched the proceedings.
For each item, Hough generally had one of three responses to staff announcing a line — the “House position” or “Governor’s position” or one of those plus new items.
The speed showed Hough had discussed each earmarked item with its backers and made sure no one else objected well ahead of the meeting. There was rarely a murmur about any decision he made.
May, the senior Democrat on the committee, said she was satisfied with the decisions.
“We have got an excellent system, and we move very quickly,” May said.
The challenge over earmarks was set up by House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel.
During committee work, Deaton moved a large number of Department of Transportation projects approved in previous years to a reappropriation bill. Keeping them in the MoDOT bill added to its apparent size when the items represented the remaining money on unfinished multi-year projects.
But instead of shifting $8 million to rehabilitate a historic footbridge in Springfield to the reappropriation bill, Deaton cut it. In retaliation Tuesday, Hough cut $19 million Deaton added to buy land for a state park in McDonald County where he lives.
First came the footbridge. As appropriation staff announced the cut, Hough’s eyes opened in mock surprise.
“Well, that’s changed,” Hough said. “We’re putting it back in.”
After lunch, the committee worked on the Department of Natural Resources budget, where the park money was added. The park funds were not recommended by Kehoe and a similar item was vetoed last year by then-Gov. Mike Parson.
As the staff reached the line, “governor’s position” was all Hough said.

ScreenshotFormer Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox has jumped into the race to be Michigan’s next governor.
Cox, a Republican who served as attorney general from 2003 to 2011, posted to social media Tuesday his intention to seek the GOP nomination.
“I’ve protected people my entire life, fought and beat the worst of the worst. Let’s not stand by and let radical politicians or woke bureaucrats undermine us any longer. I’m running to be your Governor, and together, we can Make Michigan Great Again,” said Cox, paraphrasing President Donald Trump’s trademark slogan.
Cox is now the fifth Republican to announce for governor, joining Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson and Traverse City native Evan Space.
On the Democratic side, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson have each announced their campaigns for governor, while Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, is running as an independent.
Cox, who is married to former Michigan GOP Chair Laura Cox, previously ran for governor in 2010, but came in third in the Republican primary behind Rick Snyder, who went on to serve two-terms as governor, and Pete Hoekstra, a former congressman, who was confirmed last week as the U.S. ambassador to Canada.
Cox, a Marine Corps veteran, later opened his own law firm, best known for representing former University of Michigan student-athletes in litigation against the university for sexual abuse perpetrated by former sports physician Robert Anderson.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — More Oklahomans have been getting vaccinated against measles since cases started to be reported in Oklahoma and neighboring states. 
Between Jan. 1 and April 8, 2024, nearly 24,000 MMR shots were administered according to data provided by the Oklahoma State Department of Health. In the same time frame for 2025, that number increased by 25% to almost 30,000 shots, according to the Oklahoma State Immunization Information System, a registry of electronic vaccine records. 
The first case of measles in Oklahoma was reported March 11 by OSDH. There are currently 12 cases of measles, 9 confirmed and 3 probable, with exposure sites in Oklahoma City, Claremore, Owasso and Weatherford. All cases are in unvaccinated individuals. 
Nearby, an outbreak in Texas and New Mexico has sickened over 620 people and killed three. Oklahoma’s initial measles cases had reported links to these outbreaks. Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports over 700 measles cases in 25 states. 

Erica Rankin, a spokesperson for the Health Department, said in a statement Tuesday that the agency has observed a “concurrent growing rise” in interest in the “MMR vaccine information, administration of MMR, and immunization records at our local county health departments.” But state health officials stopped short of directly linking the increase in vaccinations to the rise in measles cases. 
The Health Department provided Oklahoma Voice with data recorded in OSIIS, which does not include all vaccinations given in the state, only those entered into the system. 
Dr. Mary Clarke, former president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association, said all “Medicaid-driven” vaccines are required to be reported and many providers choose to report other vaccines. While some pharmacies and clinics may not report vaccinations, OSIIS is still the most accurate and complete dataset available on vaccinations records in the state, she said. 
Clarke, a family medicine physician in Stillwater, said she and all of her colleagues have experienced more interest than normal in the MMR vaccine, particularly among adults. She said she’s had five to 10 people reach out per week. 
“I would say the vast majority of my pediatric patients are fully vaccinated so I’m personally not seeing a lot of parents calling for their children,” she said. “But I have a lot of adults calling on for themselves, asking about themselves, asking about their grandchildren or great-grandchildren, and how to keep them as safe as possible.”
Receiving the MMR vaccine as an adult is equally as effective as being vaccinated as recommended in early childhood, Clarke said. The vaccine is recommended for children at 12 to 15 months of age and again at four to six years of age, according to the Health Department. 
The recommended age is so young because children are at “very high risk” of contracting measles, Clarke said. 
The MMR vaccine is 97% effective when given two vaccines, she said. Clarke said measles is “extraordinarily” contagious and can be spread airborne.  
“If someone is infected, we don’t go around just giving people antibiotics for measles,” she said. “There really is no good treatment. It’s supportive care only.”

Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, responds to House Bill 1004 criticism on April 15, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Senate Republicans and Democrats alike split on a vote for House Bill 1004 Tuesday ahead of a key deadline, torn between whether its language instituted “price caps” or simply brought nonprofit hospital prices inline with state standards. 
Under the proposal, large nonprofit hospitals exceeding a benchmark price for services could be penalized, even potentially losing their state tax-exempt status by 2029. 
Two other health care bills — one in each chamber — passed with near-unanimous support before the third reading deadline on Tuesday. All three bills return to their originating chamber for further consideration.
Under House Bill 1004, Sen. Chris Garten said the Office of Management and Budget will conduct a price study to identify a statewide average that, calculated as a percentage of Medicare, will be incorporated into the final average price for a particular service. 
“It’s not a price cap. You can charge whatever you want, but being a nonprofit in Indiana is a privilege,” said Garten, R-Charlestown. “… if you can’t be competitive with your pricing as a nonprofit with the systems that are for profit, then why should you enjoy the privileges of being a nonprofit in Indiana?”
Garten pointed to increasing hospital prices, though hospitals and employers have frequently sparred over studies analyzing that growth. By using a state agency, Garten said he hoped to create a pricing study that everyone could use. 
OMB will also analyze the potential pitfalls of requiring a higher physician reimbursement of “at least” 168% of the Medicare rate under newly adopted language. 
Additionally, Garten pointed to wins for hospitals, including a reformed Hospital Assessment Fee that leverages larger reimbursements from the federal government — a long-sought win for hospitals — as well as prohibiting insurers from coupling commericial contract negotiations from Medicare Advantage plans.
“I’ve been told by almost every hospital I talk to … that, alone, it would be the biggest thing we could do for rural health care,” Garten said.
A bipartisan coalition of 29 senators moved the bill while another 19 senators, including Republicans and Democrats, opposed the measure.
 Pushback to HB 1004

After a relatively smooth path through the House, the wide-ranging health care bill has encountered more trouble in the Senate, where committee members begrudgingly advanced the bill after one senator called it “the worst bill” she’d ever seen.
Sen. Liz Brown — who twice opposed the bill in two different committees — praised the community support from her local nonprofit hospital, Parkview Health, which would be included as one of the “big five” nonprofit hospital systems targeted under this bill. 
  Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, speaks on a bill on April 15, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“This is a Sophie’s Choice,” said Brown, referring to a movie in which a mother faced an impossible decision. “This is a price cap. Now, you can say they don’t have to hit the cap — which is true. They can become for profit. But we all know that our hospitals and their expansions are heavily dependent on the tax-exempt bonds that they use.”
Such bonds were used by Parkview to purchase a struggling hospital in Logansport that was losing $9,000 a day, Brown said, keeping their doors open for crucial health care services.
“Now people in Logansport, on the other side of the state, are going to be able to stay there for their cancer chemotherapy. Why? Because my not-for-profit hospital is reaching out and wants to save the care in that community.”
Sen. Tyler Johnson, an emergency physician with Parkview, criticized the for-profit hospitals in his area for backing away from health care services for underprivileged Hoosiers relying on Medicaid.
“So now all of the prisoners and the overdoses and the gunshot wounds and the psychiatric patients land in my emergency department … because they don’t get to make money off of those people,” said Johnson, R-Leo.

If the criticism was solely linked to high pay for nonprofit hospital CEOs and assets on Wall Street, Johnson asked whether other employers with high-paid leaders and out-of-state investments should also be penalized. Companies affiliated with the Employers’ Forum of Indiana, whose former leader is now the state’s health services secretary, have been some of the most ardent supporters of House Bill 1004. 
“I really don’t understand why (employers) would want to bring a bill that starts price controls … I’ve got a nice pickup truck, but I’d love for it to be cheaper. Let’s put some price controls on that,” Johnson said. “… all we’re going to do is provide chaos to the (health care) system.”
But Sen. Ed Charbonneau defended the move to potentially penalize hospitals in 2029, noting that the deadline was four sessions — and two budget cycles — away.
“I’m not concerned at this point about what will happen in 2029. I am concerned about what happens today,” said the Valparaiso Republican. “If we don’t like what’s happening today, we have to pass House Bill 1004.”
In a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, the Indiana Hospital Association said its members strove to make health care more affordable “without sacrificing … quality and access.” It praised the inclusion of certain provisions, such as direct contracting with employers and the Hospital Assessment Fee, but expressed a concern about a hard price cap.
“IHA is neutral on the bill in its current form, but as conversations continue in the coming weeks and beyond, we will remain concerned by inflexible solutions that do not take into consideration the uncertainty of rising cost pressures such as inflation, tariffs, and other economic factors that will further threaten the financial stability of Indiana’s health care ecosystem,” said IHA President Scott Tittle. “We look forward to continuing our work with legislators to strike the right balance of lowering costs while maintaining access for Hoosier patients.”
 Other health care measures move

Two other key health care bills met the third reading deadline, but will need to get the stamp of approval from their originating chamber before going to Gov. Mike Braun for his signature.
Amendments to the wide-ranging House Bill 1003 on Monday struck various portions that have been contentious in previous hearings, including site-of-service language and clarifying pricing transparency requirements for diagnostic imaging services.

Staff with the Indiana Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit will also no longer be allowed to act as law enforcement officers — which was a request from the office to expand their investigative powers. 
The bill got the support of nearly every senator, with the exception of Sen. Andy Zay. The Huntington Republican opposed the measure because of the stripped-out portions that regulated pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.
“I think it’s time to shine the magnifying glass on areas where we can reform and find savings,” said Zay about PBMs. “I implore those in positions of leadership and authority to take one more look at this.”
Across the Statehouse, the House unanimously approved another PBM measure tackling drug costs and the “unchecked power” of the drug middlemen.
Senate Bill 140 would require PBMs and insurers to have accessible networks and fair reimbursements. Complaints against the two would be filed with the Department of Insurance. 
House sponsor Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis, described the proposal as one “to ensure that patients are placed at the center of our health care system.”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)At the Art Museum of Eastern Idaho in Idaho Falls, a program called the Teens at The Art Museum is meant to encourage youth to participate in museum activities. 
“​​The demographic that visits museums is aging, and so teenagers and young adults are really the demographic that need to feel like a museum is a vital part of their community,” Amy Thompson, the museum’s development director, told the Idaho Capital Sun.

The program consists of a teen leadership council that plans art-related events throughout the year. Thompson said it gives youth the opportunity to learn marketing, leadership, community outreach and public speaking skills, and it encourages their peers to visit the museum.
The program is funded through a $10,000 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a federal agency that has funded millions of dollars in projects supporting libraries and museums throughout Idaho. Its other contributions include funding a quarter of the Idaho Commission for Libraries’ budget, providing interpretive signs at the Boise Zoo, supporting programs for individuals who are deaf at the Boise Art Museum, and supplying library materials to different Native American tribes across the state.
But funding for programs like hers is in jeopardy.
In late March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to reduce the federal agency to its “statutory functions,” ordering that “non-statutory components and functions shall be eliminated to the maximum extent.” 
Since then, all the institute’s staff has been placed on administrative leave, NPR reported. This has caused delays in processing federal funds that have already been approved, and libraries have no way of contacting the agency. And so far three states, California, Washington and Connecticut, have all had their federal library funding cut. 
As the federal government continues to reduce funding — including this month’s cut to the Idaho Humanities Council — organizations that rely on federal support, like the Idaho Commission for Libraries, are preparing in case they are next.
“I don’t know about how we’re going to fund it next year actually, but we’re hoping that we still can, because it’s kind of gaining momentum,” Thompson said. “It would be really sad to shut it down when we’re just getting speed.”











The Teens at The Art Museum program is so impactful to me because it allowed me to get real world experience while also having fun! Before, I wasn’t too interested in art but now with the experience I have I want to take more art history classes when I go to college. I think working at a museum is a job not many people think about and being able to take a glimpse into that world is so valuable and a very unique experience.

 Idaho Commission for Libraries prepares for potential funding loss

Funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services makes up 26% of the Idaho Commission for Libraries’ funding, or on average $1.6 million each year.
So far, the commission has not had federal funding withheld, but on Friday, the commission held a special meeting to create a contingency plan in case its federal funding becomes unavailable.
The commission requested board approval to allocate $300,000 to cover personnel costs through the end of the fiscal year, which ends on June 30. The board approved the funding. 
Some of the commission’s key programs that are federally funded include: 

The Idaho Talking Book Service, a free audiobook library for Idahoans who are blind, have low vision or experience other qualifying conditions. The $435,200 in annual funding pays for six full-time workers who administer the program.
My First Books/Early Learning, a program that has existed for more than 27 years and provides a book a month for eight months to children who are unlikely to have many books at home. Since the program began, it has served more than 68,000 Idaho youth, and distributed 617,000 books. It costs $114,880 each year.

Other programs include the Library Linking Idaho databases, which provides Idahoans free 24/7 access to online education, business and recreation resources; programs and professional development for Idaho youth; and continuing education opportunities and training for Idaho library staff. 
Processing for 2025 grants has ceased, and 2026 funding applications have paused, according to the Idaho Library Association. 
“The Idaho Library Association implores President Trump to reconsider this adverse action against the Institute of Library Services and the millions of Americans who love and use their libraries,” the statement reads. 
Two lawsuits have been filed to challenge Trump’s executive order. One lawsuit was filed by 21 states’ attorney generals is scheduled to be heard in court on Friday, and a second lawsuit was filed by Democracy Forward on behalf of the American Library Association.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)Legislation that would add new restrictions to the process of qualifying for Medicaid is on hold in the Wisconsin Capitol after meeting with resounding opposition at an Assembly hearing less than a week ago.
At a meeting Tuesday to vote on two other bills, State Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown) told the Assembly Committee on Public Benefit Reform that he chairs that the Medicaid measure “has some work to be done yet.”
The bill’s author, Rep. William Penterman (R-Columbus), told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email message Tuesday that the legislation “is still in the Assembly Committee on Public Benefit Reform. The conversation on how to improve the bill is ongoing.”

An opponent of the measure, however, suggested that opposition testimony had prevailed in keeping it from moving forward.
“I think you all realized how terrible and harmful that legislation was,” said committee member Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), directing his comment at his four Republican colleagues. “We heard two and a half hours of testimony overwhelmingly against that [bill].”
Clancy spoke before voting against two other bills that the committee passed 4-2 along party lines — one making sweeping revisions to Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance (UI) system, and the other barring local governments from instituting guaranteed basic income programs using tax dollars. 
Recipients marshal opposition to Medicaid measure
Medicaid covers acute and long-term medical care for low-income people as well as people with disabilities. It’s funded jointly with federal and state money and managed by the state under federal rules and guidelines.
With some exceptions, recipients must have incomes at or below the federal poverty guideline. Most Medicaid recipients must be reviewed once a year to confirm they are still eligible for the program.
AB 163 would direct the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) to conduct eligibility reviews every six months.
It also would add restrictions on the verification process — forbidding the state from automatically renewing Medicaid beneficiaries, forbidding the state from automatically filling in electronic forms with the recipient’s information except for their name and address, and cutting off a person’s ability to enroll in Medicaid for six months for failing to report a change that might make them ineligible.

Penterman, the only witness who testified at the bill’s April 10 public hearing, highlighted the statistic that 20% of Wisconsin residents are on Medicaid. 
He described the legislation as an effort to “reassess and restore integrity to the system by ensuring that only those who are truly needy and truly qualified for this coverage receive benefits.”
But the recurring message from a stream of hearing witnesses — the vast majority of them people with disabilities who rely on Medicaid for long-term health care in their homes or in the community or their family caregivers — was that the current eligibility requirements are already burdensome, and strict enough to keep out people who aren’t eligible.
“We heard from so many people who do a tremendous amount of work to prove to the state that they have low enough income, low enough assets, that they are who they say they are, that they meet the functional screen and all of the other requirements that the department has [for them] to be able to get in or stay in the program,” said Tamara Jackson, legislative policy representative for the Wisconsin Board of People with Developmental Disabilities, in an interview Tuesday.
The hearing came just two days after the bill was introduced April 8. Its fast track prompted an overnight opposition campaign by Medicaid recipients.
“We heard from people across the state who had said that they had contacted their state lawmakers about this particular bill and had really used it as an opportunity to tell them what they do to be allowed in the Medicaid program,” Jackson said.
Federal Medicaid debate draws attention
Recent Congressional action on federal legislation to extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 has included spending targets that would appear to make Medicaid reductions inevitable. Medicaid recipients have been following those debates and making public appeals to oppose cuts in the program — priming them to oppose the state proposal as well.
“I think that people are paying attention, and the reason there were so many contacts is because Medicaid is so important to folks and they’re willing to show up and talk about it,” Jackson said.
At the very start of the April 10 hearing, Penterman alluded to communications he had already received from advocates and said he planned an amendment to exempt people with developmental disabilities from some of the bill’s restrictions. He introduced the amendment later that day.
Several witnesses, however, criticized limiting the amendment to people with developmental disabilities, arguing that the bill’s requirements would be needlessly onerous for many other people.
Sandra Lomeli of Pewaukee was one of the hearing witnesses against the Medicaid bill. She is the mother of two adult children with severe disabilities who are able to get long-term care through Medicaid. One requires 24-hour care as a sexual assault survivor, she said.
Lomeli is also covered by BadgerCare Plus, the Wisconsin Medicaid plan for primary and specialty health care and hospitalization, because being her children’s family caregiver limits her working hours to a part-time nonprofit position.
She told the committee that she fills both sides of a ream’s worth of forms each year to confirm her children’s Medicaid eligibility. She said she spends 54 hours completing those forms and 10 hours confirming her own eligibility each year.
In her testimony Lomeli challenged lawmakers to enlist Medicaid participants and advocates if they wanted to write legislation to improve the program.
It appeared to Lomeli that her suggestion “took people by surprise that we would even be at the table,” she said in an interview Tuesday. “I don’t think they valued that we could add value — because if they did, somebody would have reached out.”
She said she doesn’t consider the legislation dead, however, which concerns her.
“The issue is not off the table yet,” Lomeli said. “They’re just going to reword it. We have won the battle now. We haven’t won the war.
UI change, basic-income ban, both pass on party lines
While setting the Medicaid bill aside Tuesday, the Committee on Public Benefit Reform advanced two others with only Republican votes.
AB 164 would rename Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance system as a “re-employment assistance” program with new requirements for workers and for the state agency that administers it.
Those include requiring recipients, who must currently make four work searches a week, to make two of those in the form of direct contacts with prospective employers. It also adds a variety of additional counseling procedures and requirements for people who receive unemployment benefits.
Department of Workforce Development Secretary-designee Amy Pechacek submitted written testimony expressing “concerns about this proposal due to the anticipated reporting burden for employers, potential costs, bureaucratic requirements, and lack of sustainable funding.”
Gov. Tony Evers vetoed similar legislation in 2023, citing similar complaints as well as the fact that it did not go through the state’s joint labor-management unemployment advisory council.
AB 165 would bar local governments from using tax dollars to create guaranteed income programs without a work or training requirement. Evers vetoed a similar bill to that one in 2023 as well, on the grounds it usurped local control. 
Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) made the same argument against the current legislation.
Knodl defended the both bills as helping to “protect the integrity of these systems, and that’s important if we want them to be sustainable in the future.”
Clancy argued that both should have been put on pause along with the Medicaid bill.
“But all three of those . . . bills are fundamentally the same,” Clancy said. “They are kicking people when they are down. They are hitting people at their most vulnerable, and frankly, in 2025, when national and state Republican policies have meant that people have more needs. We should not be attacking those social safety nets.”

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas House will consider a bill denounced by advocates for transgender Arkansans on Wednesday, the final day of the 2025 legislative session.
Senate Bill 486 would allow Arkansans to sue for damages if they encounter someone in a bathroom, changing room, shelter or correctional facility who does not align with the “designated sex” of the restroom. The bill narrowly passed the House Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs on Tuesday after 14 people spoke against it and no member of the public spoke for it.
“The intention here is to make it so that trans people cannot exist in public,” said Maricella Garcia, Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families’ race equity director. “If you cannot use the restroom, you cannot go out in public.”
Garcia was among several people who said that enforcing SB 486 would require policing and making assumptions about people’s bodies and likely lead to frivolous lawsuits costing taxpayer money.
SB 486 is among many bills related to transgender Arkansans that Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, has sponsored in the past few legislative sessions, including one the Senate passed Tuesday pertaining to gender-affirming healthcare.











It’s not good legislation, it’s not good for our community and it’s not good Christian values.


– Marie Mainard O'Connell, a Presbyterian pastor speaking against SB 486



Bentley sponsored Act 317 of 2023, which prohibits K-12 students from using bathrooms that do not match their gender assigned at birth and requires schools to have a “reasonable accommodation,” such as a single-occupancy bathroom, for those unable or unwilling to do so.
Similarly, SB 486 states that shelters, correctional facilities and other entities must take “reasonable steps” to comply with the policy; Bentley said signage indicating who is allowed and not allowed in a space would be sufficient, and she said SB 486 is meant to be an extension of Act 317.
Bentley also supported Act 619 of 2023, which initially would have criminalized entering and remaining in bathrooms and locker rooms that do not match an adult’s gender assigned at birth if children are present. After hours of public pushback before the House Judiciary Committee, that legislation was amended to limit potential criminal charges and prosecutions to adults present in those spaces with criminal intent.
The conservative Family Council worked with lawmakers from both political parties to formulate the amendment to Act 619 two years ago. On Tuesday, Family Council attorney Stephanie Nichols said SB 486 would close “loopholes” in the law to more closely regulate who can enter gender-specific bathrooms.
Evelyn Rios Stafford, a Washington County justice of the peace and Arkansas’ first openly transgender elected official, spoke against Act 619 two years ago and against SB 486 Tuesday.
“We had a compromise that worked for everybody,” she said. “…Everybody walked away feeling that that was a bill that everybody can live with, and now I feel like that compromise and that promise is being broken.”

Arkansas House committee changes controversial public bathroom bill


 Sexual violence discussion

Nichols and Bentley repeatedly said SB 486 protects women’s and girls’ privacy, the same argument supporters of Act 317 and Act 619 used. Rep. Cindy Crawford, R-Fort Smith, was the House sponsor of Act 619 and said Tuesday that not passing SB 486 “opens the door” to men entering women’s bathrooms to commit sexual violence.
Several opponents of SB 486 said not only that transgender women in bathrooms are not a threat, but also that they are often survivors of sexual violence and that the bill does nothing to prevent such things.
“[This bill] exploits my trauma to push a political agenda that’s rooted not in facts but in fear,” Brittany Stockton said. “…The idea that predators are pretending to be trans to attack people in bathrooms is a harmful myth.”
Multiple speakers also said transgender people face a higher risk of identity-based violence and harassment than other demographics. Marie Mainard O’Connell, a Presbyterian pastor and mother of a transgender teen, said she fears one day having to conduct a funeral service for a transgender person dead by suicide or targeted violence.
“If I have to perform that service, you’re getting an invitation,” she told the committee.

Crawford said SB 486 is not intended to harm anyone and her “heart hurts” for transgender people who feel targeted.
“Why should we protect this minority, trans people, when we are putting in danger young women and women in bathrooms that are designated for their sex?” Crawford said.
O’Connell responded to Crawford’s statement by reminding the committee that one of Jesus’ parables in the Bible involves a shepherd leaving 99 sheep behind to search for one that was missing.
“Please vote no on this,” O’Connell said. “It’s not good legislation, it’s not good for our community and it’s not good Christian values.”
Rep. Nicole Clowney, D-Fayetteville, said transgender people who no longer physically resemble their gender assigned at birth would be at risk of violence if the law requires them to use the bathroom that does not align with their identity.
Bentley said Clowney was “way out there on a limb” and reiterated the “reasonable steps” portion of SB 486.
“We have two sexes, male and female, no matter how [many] drugs you take or the kind of surgery you have,” Bentley said.
She introduced the bill to the committee Monday, but was asked to pull it down before public comment. House Minority Leader Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, asked for an analysis of the bill’s fiscal impact, expressing concerns that public buildings would incur significant costs in order to meet the accommodation standards in SB 486.
The fiscal impact statement from the Department of Finance and Administration asserts that SB 486 will not require the expenditure of state funds or “the construction or modification of any state facilities.”
Rios Stafford disputed this and said not all government buildings in Arkansas have single-occupancy restrooms.
“Any county, any city that wants to do the right thing by their citizens is going to have to spend money and is going to have to spend a lot of money, and we know how much retrofitting a building costs, especially if it’s an older building that was grandfathered in before the Americans with Disabilities Act,” Rios Stafford said.
The Arkansas Senate passed SB 486 along party lines April 2.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Senate action on transgender health care

On Tuesday, the Senate sent a bill to the governor’s desk that would broaden the scope of a 2023 law that created civil liability for doctors who provide gender-affirming health care to transgender minors.
The Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act, or Act 274 of 2023, created a 15-year window for adults to sue physicians for “any physical, psychological, emotional, or physiological injury” incurred while the adult received hormone replacement therapy, puberty blockers or gender-affirming surgeries as a minor.
Bentley sponsored both Act 274 and its proposed amendment, House Bill 1916, which would add mental health care providers to the law’s list of medical professionals liable for “gender-affirming intervention.” She has repeatedly said gender-affirming medical care is harmful to minors; physicians who treat transgender children said otherwise during the 2022 trial over a Bentley-sponsored 2021 law that sought to ban this care.
The Senate Judiciary Committee passed HB 1916 Monday night. Bentley told the committee that gender-affirming care consists of “grotesque experiments that stunt and suppress a child’s natural development in service of scientific fantasies.”
All 29 Republican senators voted to send HB 1916 to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ desk Tuesday while all six Democrats voted against it.

Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, was the only member of the Judiciary Committee to vote against HB 1916 Monday. He said he agreed with public testimony that the bill’s use of the phrase ​​”gender-affirming intervention” is too broad.
Psychologist Lindsey Thomas said HB 1916 would hold therapists liable for using transgender minors’ preferred names and pronouns as “gender-affirming intervention”; Bentley agreed that the bill would preclude this from happening.
Thomas also said HB 1916 would increase the costs of providers’ medical malpractice insurance and increase wait times for all children to see a therapist in Arkansas.
The bill mentions hormones and puberty blockers, but the six health care professionals that opposed the bill Monday said mental health care providers do not prescribe these medications. Nine more people had signed up to speak against the bill but did not get to speak due to the committee’s time constraints.
“We don’t know if or when an issue of gender dysphoria might show up,” said Garry Teeter, a counselor and a Christian pastor. “We may be working with that child for months or years, and then this comes up in therapy… At that point, it would be detrimental and harmful to the client for the therapist to say, ‘Because of this particular law that’s now being considered, we’re no longer able to provide you the care that we have been providing.’”
In March, members of the House Judiciary Committee, the public and the Arkansas Attorney General’s staff expressed concerns that Bentley’s House Bill 1668 would infringe on the right to freedom of expression. That bill would have created civil liability for any adult who aids a minor’s “social transitioning,” including “changes in clothing, pronouns, hairstyle, and name.”
Bentley promised to amend HB 1668 but withdrew it the day after she filed HB 1916.

Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, addresses the House chamber on Tuesday, April 15, 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Multiple Republican energy bills dealing with incentives for nuclear power inched closer to the governor’s desk Tuesday following key votes in both the House and Senate.
That included House Bill 1007, a priority measure that would expedite approval processes for large-load customers like data centers and create cost recovery mechanisms for projects utilities take on to serve those big customers. 
It also would require a big prospective grid addition to make “significant and meaningful financial assurances” for such projects — reimbursing at least 80% of costs and protecting other existing and future customers from the expenses.
The bill additionally gets tough with utilities planning to close — or convert to natural gas — any coal-fired plants of at least 125 megawatts. Current law mandates utilities that are not generating at least 85% of peak demand to report three-year projections to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC).
The legislation would instead require all utilities to annually report the amount of resource generating capacity they plan to take offline. If, after an investigation, the IURC doesn’t think a utility can provide reliable service, it would have to block the utility’s plan or order it to either acquire or build capacity.
“This bill is about three things: high-wage advanced manufacturing jobs, protecting consumers from rate shifts from large-scale loads, and protecting consumers from rate increases through premature plant closures,” said bill sponsor Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford. “Those are three worthy goals.”
 Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, laughs with a colleague in the Senate chamber on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The bill advanced from the Senate in a 36-13 vote, with some bipartisan opposition. All but one Democrat — Sen. David Niezgodski, a co-sponsor — voted against the proposal, along with four Republicans: Sens. Ron Alting, Vaneta Becker, Aaron Freeman and Mike Young.
After strong pushback, senators removed more contentious provisions that intended to boost small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) development — including a 20% sales tax credit for SMR manufacturers.
But Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford, of Indianapolis, said he still had “serious concerns” about pieces left in the bill that could boost “a risky, unproven technology,” referring to SMRs.
“My constituents … they don’t  support this,” he said. “They don’t want to be the test case for nuclear experiments that have failed in other states.”










House Bill 1007 missed the opportunity to put important consumer protections in place.


– Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis


Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis, expressed additional concerns “about the message being sent to ratepayers and the entire state.”
“House Bill 1007 missed the opportunity to put important consumer protections in place,” she said. “We know that our utilities already operate as state-sanctioned monopolies, and we have to make sure that we are empowering the IURC, but also empowering ourselves and our ratepayers, to truly, truly get a handle on the increasing rates, and make sure that we’re not politicizing that in any way.”
Shortly after the Senate voted to return the bill to the House for final approval, Robyn Skuya-Boss, director for the Hoosier Chapter of the Sierra Club, reiterated the advocacy group’s concerns over what she called an “Energy Inflation Act.” 
She emphasized that legislative action came just days after Gov. Mike Braun signed coal-related executive orders similar to those endorsed by President Donald Trump. 
“Hoosiers should be alarmed that we’re witnessing a massive transfer of wealth from hard-working families to financially healthy utilities and tech companies in the form of higher utility bills along with increased air and water pollution,” Skuya-Boss said in a statement. “Renewable energy adds a tremendous amount of value to the grid, and it’s disheartening that lawmakers, utilities, and tech companies are actively standing in the way of progress for Indiana’s economy and our environment.”
House moves two Senate bills
Across the hall, lawmakers in the House made progress on two other bills, overcoming hesitation from some members of the supermajority.
The first, Senate Bill 423, forms a small modular nuclear reactor “pilot” program intended to attract interested developers to bring nuclear to Indiana. Bill sponsor Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valpraiso, made clear though that the legislation blocks program participants from charging ratepayers for no-cost contributions by third parties.
Opposition brings likely end to Indiana utility siting bill, but the issue isn’t going away

“Already, partnerships are being formed. …. What this bill does is place restrictions on those partnerships that currently do not exist,” he said. “It’s important that we have some control over these partnerships.”
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, said he while “appreciate(d)” the bill’s intent to require tech companies to “pick up some of these costs for SMRs, it still has a fatal flaw.”
“At the end of the day, if the project doesn’t pan out, which I think is maybe more likely than not … the ratepayers are going to be on the hook for some of those costs, which is going to be substantial,” Pierce said.
The bill ultimately passed in a mixed 67-29 vote, sending it back to the Senate chamber.
Also returning to the opposing chamber one last time — in a similarly divided 59-38 tally — is Senate Bill 425, which addresses transitions of coal-fired plants to natural gas or SMR sites.
Soliday said the bill seeks to ensure that locals don’t drag out rezoning processes needed for those transitions to move forward. 
Provisions in the legislation set timelines for both utilities and local zoning authorities to prevent yearslong “back and forth delays” that defer decisions.
“In some counties, not all, instead of making a decision, they keep deferring,” Soliday said, pointing to moratoriums, for example, that “keep investors’ money tied up, and they can’t move forward with a project.” 
The bill limits such moratoriums to just one year, then local governments “have to decide.”

“A ‘no’ is OK,” Soliday continued, “but do it in a timely way so the developers can move on.”
Pierce had reservations about this measure, too.
“What this bill is basically saying is if someone comes into your community and they want to put a small modular reactor into a generation facility that exists, your local communities have nothing they can say about that,” he said.
“I think it’s a mistake what we’re doing,” Pierce added. “We’re essentially saying that we value efficiency and speed more than we value public input, because under the current system, you kind of have this back and forth with advisory planning commissions … and that does take some time, but it gives people who are interested in that zoning issue an opportunity to be involved.”
Rep. Kendell Culp, R-Rensselaer, maintained that the bill still allows “an opportunity to go back and forth with the planning commission.” 
“The ultimate decision-makers are the county commissioners, the legislative body,” Culp held. “What a lot of these communities are doing is they’re using this as a stall tactic. … We’re trying to tighten up this loophole a little bit. Local units will still have a whole year to make a decision, and they can still say no, but they can’t delay decisions. … because this drives down development, currently.”

Both measures drew bipartisan support during a hearing Tuesday in the Assembly Way and Means Committee. 
One bill — AB 17 — would provide a tax credit to businesses that make the transition to a model that gives employees a stake. The credit would cover 70% of the costs for converting a business to a worker-owned cooperative or 50% of the costs for converting the business to an employee stock ownership plan. Businesses could receive a maximum of $100,000 from the tax credit. 
In a worker-owned cooperative, employees jointly own the business and have control over its operations. Employee stock ownership plans give employees partial or full ownership of a company’s stock as an investment for their retirement. 
According to the UW Center for Cooperatives, there are 728 cooperatives across the state, including 33 worker-owned cooperatives. 
The bill would create an individual income tax subtraction and a corporate income and franchise tax deduction for  the capital gain realized from the conversion. It would also instruct the Department of Revenue to create a program to promote employee-owned and cooperative business structures, providing education, outreach, technical assistance and training.
“More than ever, Wisconsin benefits from companies keeping jobs here, investing in their communities and staying locally owned,” bill coauthor Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) told lawmakers on the committee. This type of business structure, he said, is a “strong tool” to encourage that goal. 
James said the tax incentive would help businesses considering switching because the conversion process can be complicated and expensive.
According to the National Center for Employee Ownership, a transition to a worker-owned model can initially cost between $10,000 and $30,000. Converting to an employee stock ownership plan can generally cost between $100,000 and $300,000, with ongoing costs of $20,000 to $30,000 a year.
Several Wisconsinites who have benefited from making the switch testified in favor of the bill. 
John Dally, a veterinarian, said it would provide “critical support” for cooperatives in Wisconsin. Dally started a practice about 20 years ago with a colleague in Spring Green, and in 2020, they  acquired another location in Mazomanie. 
As they were getting older, he said, they began considering retirement and the future for their business, Cooperative Veterinary Care.
“We wanted to ensure the practice would stay in these small communities, continue to serve the families and the pets that we just come to know and love — we’ve worked with them for our entire careers — and we also wanted to have some fair and equitable options for our employees and have a return on our investment to sell,” Dally said. 
Dally said historically veterinary practices would be sold to younger associates, but with increasing costs of education, many young veterinarians cannot take on the additional debt that comes with taking it over. Private equity firms and large corporations have also been acquiring small practices in recent years, he said.
According to Brakke Consulting, a veterinary management consulting firm, nearly 25% of general veterinary practices and 75% of specialty practices, such as emergency and surgery care, are owned by large corporations. The issue of consolidation in the pet care field by large corporations has gotten the attention of U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. 
“We were looking around and thinking, what could we do, and I came upon this idea of employee ownership and it just made total sense,” Dally said. He said the transition in 2022 to a worker-owned cooperative cost about $30,000. He said a grant helped with the expense, and they also received support from the UW Center for Cooperatives. 
‘Tangible, positive impact’
Dally said that their team of veterinarians, technicians and assistants have been able to take ownership of the business. The employees, he said, range in age from 20 to 58 and come from a variety of backgrounds. 
“We all came together to create bylaws, manage the business, make decisions about how to allocate resources in smart and equitable ways,” Dally said. He said the cooperative has kept these veterinary services in these communities when they might have closed as they retired or sold to a large corporation who may or may not have kept them there. 
In the three years since transitioning, Dally said the worker cooperative has developed a beneficial health insurance program and a mental health program, invested in new equipment, raised wages and distributed additional profits back to the employees.
“It’s just created a tangible, positive impact on our local communities. It provides a clear pathway for employees to not only work for the business, but to own a piece of it and benefit from its success and all their efforts and enthusiasm,” Dally said. “Our experience in transitioning to this model is proof that it works, particularly in small communities.” 
Dally said it would not have been possible without the help they received, and  the bill could provide the necessary support to other businesses looking to make the transition. 
“It will allow businesses like ours to thrive and continue serving their communities while providing meaningful economic benefits for workers. It has the potential to change the landscape of business ownerships in Wisconsin, especially in these rural communities that are often overlooked by larger corporate interests,” Dally said. “We need your support to make this a reality.” 
Kristin Forde with the UW Center for Cooperatives told lawmakers that the center’s staff has  seen greater interest in employee ownership as a succession strategy for retiring owners, but the models remain largely unknown among business owners. 
Forde said the state is likely to face a crisis in business as Baby Boomers prepare to retire. 
“We really see employee ownership as… a solution to that problem,” Forde said. The legislation, she said, would tie together education and financial incentives to ensure that employee-owned cooperatives are a “feasible solution to retaining jobs and services in our communities.” 
Promoting safe gun storage 
Republicans and Democrats also appeared supportive of AB 10, which would eliminate sales taxes on devices meant to ensure safe storage of guns.
According to the CDC, unintentional injury is a top cause of death among children with guns being a leading method for injury. “It was kind of jarring to hear that,” bill coauthor Rep. Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee) said. 
Neylon said unsecured firearms are a major cause for those deaths and injuries, and that  he wanted to propose a way to make safe storage more affordable. 
“This isn’t about politics,” Neylon said. “This is about saving kids’ lives.”
Neylon said after hearing from constituents and consulting with the state Department of Revenue, he has amended the bill to cover a variety of devices in addition to gun safes. 
The amendment defines  a “firearm storage device” as a locked and fully enclosed container and excludes glass-faced display cabinets. It adds “firearm safety” devices, “installed on a firearm designed to prevent unauthorized access to the firearm or to prevent it from being operated without first deactivating the device.” 
Rep. Joan Fitzgerald (D-Fort Atkinson) said she supports the action, but called for more to be done. 
“Protecting our kids and our communities should be top of mind for many of us… and there are a lot of people that are not responsible gun owners, so I do think we need to do more in this area,” Fitzgerald said. 
Gov. Tony Evers has also included the proposal in his 2025-27 budget, but Republican leaders on the Joint Finance Committee have removed it from his previous budget proposals and have said they plan to write their own budget. Fitzgerald asked Neylon why he proposed the measure if it was included in Evers’ budget. 
“I think, personally, this is at risk of being pulled out of the budget as a public policy item,” Neylon said. While his bill does have a fiscal impact, “I think there’s precedent of doing this through legislation in the past,” he added. “But if it ultimately is in a budget that I support, I would be happy about that.” 
Deductions for teachers’ classroom costs
Lawmakers also considered AB 64, which would allow teachers to claim a tax deduction of up to $300 for expenses, including professional development courses, books and other classroom supplies. It, too, has bipartisan support.
Bill coauthors Sen. Dan Feyen (R-Fond du Lac) and Rep. David Armstrong (R-Rice Lake said) the bill mirrors the deduction that is already available for teachers when they file their federal taxes.
“This would double the potential benefit and bring teachers significantly closer to be made whole,” Armstrong said. 
Armstrong noted that teachers “sometimes find it necessary to purchase books or supplies for their classrooms.”  He added that he has  two daughters who are teachers and remind him about the costs “consistently at the beginning of school.”
CESA 6 CEO Ted Neitzke told lawmakers his wife, a Sheboygan middle school language arts teacher, has a classroom with likely “tens of thousands of dollars worth of Mrs. Neitzke’s investments in books and materials.” 
“This is something that… would be a great tool for local school systems, especially when we’re competing nationally for talent, to be able to support our staff in reimbursing some costs that they spend,” Neitzke said. “Any little bit helps.”

The drug take back day events are hosted by several eastern Idaho law enforcement agencies and health care organizations, Eastern Idaho Public Health announced in a news release last week.
Medications — prescribed, over-the-counter and veterinary drugs — will be accepted. Vaping equipment without batteries will also be accepted, such as vape pens, cartridges and other e-cigarette devices. Needles will not be accepted.
 Why are there drug take back sites?

Unused prescription drugs can be abused, or even hurt wildlife and the environment if flushed away, public health officials say.
Nearly 14% of Idaho high schoolers reported misusing prescription drugs at least once in their life, according to the 2021 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey. 
Almost 74% of Idaho students who reported misusing prescription drugs in the past year say they did it in their homes, the 2021 Idaho Healthy Youth Survey found. 
Around 48% of those students said they misused their own prescription drugs, while almost 21% say they received them from friends or family for free and nearly 19% say they bought them from friends or family, according to that survey, which surveyed kids in sixth, eighth, 10th and 12th grade.
 How to dispose of prescription drugs in eastern Idaho?

Drug take back sites will be open across the eight-county Eastern Idaho Public Health District, including:
Bonneville County: Blue Cross of Idaho Office, at 3630 S. 25th East in Idaho Falls
Jefferson County: Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office at 200 Courthouse Way in Rigby
Madison County: 

Walmart at 1450 North Second East in Rexburg
Madison County DMV at 510 North Second East in Rexburg

Fremont County: St. Anthony City Building at 420 N. Bridge St in St. Anthony 
Teton County: Teton County Sheriff’s Office at 230 N. Main St. in Driggs
Lemhi County: Steele Memorial Medical Center’s special clinic parking lot at 805 Main St. in Salmon

Republicans have repeatedly criticized Democrats over declining reading scores, which Gov. Gretchen Whitmer acknowledged in her 2025 State of the State speech, calling on lawmakers to support the Students, Metrics, And Results with Transparency (SMART) Plan included in her school aid budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2026. 
“Just 24% of fourth graders can read proficiently. The same percentage of eighth graders are proficient in math. I get that this is a national trend, but the reality is that we invest more per-pupil than most states and achieve bottom 10 results,” Whitmer said.

Scores are going in the wrong direction, even though schools in Michigan have been receiving record levels of funding, Hall said, telling reporters that lawmakers have to do something differently.
Rather than seeking a plan that would receive full support from Republicans and no support for Democrats, Hall said his caucus looked to changes they could implement immediately that would get bipartisan support. 
“And we’ve been moving on those things. And if that just moves the needle, 20% where, you know, we’re making a 20% improvement to education, well, that adds up over time,” Hall said. 
As the House returns to session this week, Hall said the chamber would vote on a number of policies including a plan to administer the state’s educational assessment test multiple times throughout the school year to help benchmark student’s progress over time. 
They would also be taking up a plan to modernize the state’s merit curriculum system, Hall said, with House Bill 4156 expanding the classes students can take to meet graduation requirements, with the intention of allowing them a pathway that better matches their talents and interests, including options for pursuing vocational training. 
“Things like computer coding could be a foreign language. Computer science could be a science class. Construction math could fulfill the math requirements. Accounting could fulfill the math requirements. Trade schools will count as dual enrollment. So what we’re trying to do is we’re trying to modernize the curriculum to focus on real life skills,” Hall said. 
The House will also be working to support curriculum development through legislation establishing a list of recommended curricula that have been proven to be effective and include strategies for differentiating instruction and ensuring they are accessible to all students, including those with disabilities. 
House Republicans have also put forth legislation ensuring reading and writing instruction for kindergarten through Grade 6 are based on science reading standards, while the content standards for Math from kindergarten through Grade 5 would include updated standards crafted by at least two faculty members from the mathematics departments of two separate public universities in Michigan. They must also include input from at least two elementary school mathematics teachers with an average classroom proficiency level of 70%, with at least 25% of their students meeting the income eligibility standards for federal free and reduced-price lunch programs.



Other pieces of Republicans’ education plan include:

House Bill 4148: which aims to improve representation from rural and northern school districts on the State Board of Education by dividing the state into four districts and requiring political parties nominate candidates from all four districts on a rotating schedule. 
House Joint Resolution E: which would place an amendment to the state constitution on the ballot, allowing the governor to appoint the state superintendent, where the position is currently appointed by the eight members of the State Board of Education.




Hall noted that a number of the policies that already passed received strong bipartisan support, including legislation expanding high school dual enrollment to include trade schools; eliminating fees in applying for or renewing a teacher’s certificate, endorsements or permit and requiring school systems to send an annual notification to students’ guardians that includes data on the school’s performance on state assessments by subject area from the MI School Data website.
As the House moves forward on education, Hall touted the GOP’s road funding plan, noting that it had received support from Democrats like Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel and Wayne County Executive Warren Evans.
While the House Republican plan aims to provide $3.1 billion for road repairs by diverting existing dollars and eliminating spending on corporate subsidies, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has proposed a $3 billion plan, which would bring in additional revenue by ending a loophole exempting the marijuana industry from the wholesale tax applied to other products like cigarettes and tobacco, and aiming to bring in an additional $1.6 billion in tax revenue from large corporations and big tech companies. 
Though he disagreed with Whitmer’s plan, Hall questioned where the Democratic-led Michigan Senate’s plan was, calling for the chamber to step up on the discussion. 
“We just need the Senate to come together and actually engage in this process. I think it’s very clear. You see me stepping into this moment. You see Governor Whitmer engaging. I don’t think either one of us are the problem here. There’s one of the three legs here that’s not engaging, and that’s the Senate,” Hall said. 
When asked whether Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) had discussed road funding with Hall, her spokesperson, Rosie Jones, said they’re not going into the details about what had been discussed, but noted the Senate Appropriations committee would be taking up the House’s road funding bills in its meeting on Wednesday.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0567-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 07:05:48.030069

Declining staffing and funding have left North Dakotans in the lurch, dealing with long wait times on the phone and in Social Security offices, busy signals on the phone, or being unable to reach anyone for their customer service needs. SSA scrapped a service change last week that would have forced many North Dakotans to go to a Social Security office in person for routine services currently handled over the phone. This would have been a significant barrier to service in a state where 13,000 people over 65 live 180 miles round-trip from the nearest SSA office. 
No organization has been more outspoken about tackling SSA’s customer service issues than AARP.
While we’re encouraged that SSA is listening to customer service concerns, we won’t take potential improvements for granted. The incoming Social Security administrator needs to focus on delivering effective and efficient customer service to everyone who needs access to Social Security. 

Learn more at aarp.org/socialsecurity.

According to SSA’s own data, call wait times, hold times, and customer service resolutions have been inconsistent for years. Call volume to SSA has increased substantially, and wait times are rising. Fewer people can reach a Social Security representative to meet their needs, and fewer people are getting resolutions to their problems.
It doesn’t help that Congress hasn’t provided the funding necessary to ensure Social Security can deliver quality customer service. Funding to improve the program has long been on the decline. SSA funding has dropped by 9% since 2018.
This challenge emerges just as more people – approximately 10,000 people every day – are retiring. 
Yet, SSA has been unclear and uncommunicative with the public about its customer service issues in 2025. From backtracking on phone service changes to confusion over office closures, SSA’s public controversies have driven anxiety for Americans everywhere. If they don’t commit to customer service improvements, it will cause real hardship for many older Americans trying to get the Social Security they have earned. 
The incoming Social Security commissioner would be well served by re-committing SSA to providing timely, efficient and effective customer service. SSA must be clear when communicating any possible changes and the effects of lower staffing levels. And Congress needs to provide oversight to ensure that customer service is prioritized at an agency that has struggled to serve Americans everywhere.

(Lue Palmer Verite)Residents of the mostly Black communities sandwiched between chemical plants along the lower Mississippi River have long said they get most of the pollution but few of the jobs produced by the region’s vast petrochemical industry.
A new study led by Tulane University backs up that view, revealing stark racial disparities across the U.S. petrochemical workforce. Inequity was especially pronounced in Louisiana, where people of color were underrepresented in both high- and low-paying jobs at chemical plants and refineries.
“It was really surprising how consistently people of color didn’t get their fair share of jobs in the petrochemical industry,” said Kimberly Terrell, a research scientist with the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic. “No matter how you slice or dice the data by states, metro areas or parishes, the data’s consistent.”
Toxic air pollution in Louisiana’s petrochemical corridor, an area often referred to as “Cancer Alley,” has risen in recent years. The burdens of pollution have been borne mostly by the state’s Black and poor communities, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The Tulane study’s findings match what Cancer Alley residents have suspected for decades, said Joy Banner, co-founder of the Descendants Project, a nonprofit that advocates for Black communities in the parishes between New Orleans and Baton Rouge.
“You hear it a lot – that Black people are not getting the jobs,” she said. “But to have the numbers so well documented, and to see just how glaring they are – that was surprising.”
People of color were underrepresented in all of the highest-paying jobs among the 30 states with a large petrochemical industry presence, but Louisiana and Texas had “the most extreme disparities,” according to the study, which was published in the journal Ecological Economics.
While several states had poor representation on the upper pay scale, people of color were typically overrepresented in the lower earnings tiers.
In Texas, nearly 60% of the working-age population is non-white, but people of color hold 39% of higher-paying positions and 57% of lower-paying jobs in the chemical industry.
Louisiana was the only state in which people of color are underrepresented in both pay categories. People who aren’t white make up 41% of the working-age population but occupy just 21% of higher-paying jobs and about 33% of lower-paid jobs.
The study relied on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Bureau of Labor Statistics and Louisiana Economic Development.
The chemical industry disputed the study’s findings.
“We recognize the importance of examining equity in employment, however, this study offers an incomplete and misleading portrayal of our industry and its contributions,” David Cresson, president and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association, said in a statement.
Cresson pointed to several industry-supported workforce development programs, scholarships and science camps aimed at “closing the training gap in Louisiana.”
But the study indicates education and training levels aren’t at the root of underrepresentation among states or metro areas. Louisiana’s education gap was modest, with college attainment at 30% for white residents and 20% for people of color. In places such as Lake Charles and St. John the Baptist Parish, where petrochemical jobs are common, the gap was minimal — five percentage points or less.
The industry’s investments in education are “just public relations spin,” Banner said.
“The amount of money they’re investing in schools and various programs pales in comparison to how much they’re profiting in our communities,” she said. “We sacrifice so much and get so little in return.”
Louisiana is also getting little from generous tax breaks aimed at boosting employment, the study found.
The state’s Industrial Tax Exemption Program has granted 80% to 100% property tax exemptions to companies that promise to create new jobs. For each job created in Cameron Parish, where large natural gas ports have been built in recent years, companies were exempted from almost $590,000 in local taxes. In St. John, each job equated to about $1 million in uncollected tax revenue.
“This tradeoff of pollution in exchange for jobs was never an equal trade,” said Gianna St. Julien, one of the study’s authors. “But this deal is even worse when the overwhelming majority of these companies’ property taxes are not being poured back into these struggling communities.”

Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond, chats with colleagues in the Senate chamber on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Tensions flared Tuesday in the Indiana Senate as conversations around an education deregulation bill devolved into a debate over social-emotional learning, or SEL.
In focus was House Bill 1002, a Republican-backed measure that despite its length — 165 pages in the latest draft — would strike multiple sections of current state education code, trimming about 35,000 words in all. 
Examples include the removal of dozens of “may” provisions, eliminating specific COVID-19 pandemic requirements and striking duplicate code. Republican bill author Rep. Bob Behning estimated that the cuts would reduce state education regulations by nearly 10%.










Teachers should be focusing on academic rigor, math, science, reading, writing and technical skills, instead of emotional regulation, empathy.


– Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville


There was bipartisan concern, however, about the bill’s deletion of existing requirements for teachers to complete training in SEL trauma-informed care and cultural competency.
The bill would remove “social, emotional, and behavioral functioning” evaluations from school psychologists’ list of responsibilities. School improvement plans also would no longer be required to incorporate “culturally appropriate strategies for increasing education opportunities” for certain student populations at the school, including different racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups.
SEL, in particular, has been targeted by Republican lawmakers in recent legislative sessions and criticized by conservative groups that say such practices are akin to liberal ideology and should not be permitted in schools.
Some senators push back
GOP supporters said the newest proposed rollbacks are in response to federal guidance. A recent U.S. Department of Education letter, for example, said considerations based on race in educational settings is “unlawful.”
“Teachers should be focusing on academic rigor, math, science, reading, writing and technical skills, instead of emotional regulation, empathy,” said Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville. “Teachers are not therapists, nor should they be treated as such. Trained, licensed mental health professionals are better equipped to handle the social emotional aspects of student life.”


Republican senators who voted against House Bill 1002:

Sen. Ron Alting, of Lafayette 
Sen. Vaneta Becker, of Evansville
Sen. Mike Bohacek, of Michiana Shores
Sen. Sue Glick, of LaGrange
Sen. Jean Leising, of Oldenburg
Sen. Jim Tomes, of Wadesville
Sen. Mike Young, of Indianapolis 
Sen. Andy Zay, of Huntington



But his colleague, Republican Sen. Ron Alting, of Lafayette, disagreed. He emphasized that “the best counseling I’ve had in my whole life was from my teachers and my coaches.”
“If it wasn’t for my coaches and my teachers in my life to keep me straight, to keep me going, I’m not sure where I’d be today. I sure wouldn’t be here, I can tell you that,” he said.
“Those of you saying teachers aren’t qualified … these kids need help … these kids need someone to love them,” Alting continued, becoming more passionate. “I will leave the room if I hear another senator in this place say that a teacher or coach is not qualified to talk to our kids, or that these kids don’t need to be talked to because they do.”
Across the aisle, Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, pointed to oppositional testimony provided by teachers.
“They thought that removing this requirement was going to be a bad thing for their classrooms,” he said. “I hear, by and large, from a lot of parents and teachers is that behaviors are the problem in the classroom, and that we need help. … Proponents of the bill say this is something that the parents should be taking care of at home … and that teachers aren’t therapists or social workers.”
“Ask a teacher, if they have a kid in their classroom that is having meltdown after meltdown after meltdown, disrupting the classroom, consistently jeopardizing the education of everybody else in the classroom … I can guarantee you that teacher is going to say, ‘Yes, SEL is probably going to be something that is going to provide some assistance to those students in those classrooms,” Pol noted.
Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford, of Indianapolis, doubled down that SEL “applies skills to manage emotions, build relationships and make responsible decisions.”
“I have seen this first hand with some of the students that I have been in with schools. Instead of a student striking another student, the educators were able to talk with the students and explain that we need to use our words, as opposed to striking another student. That’s social emotional learning,” Ford maintained. “That is a life skill that a student is going to need for the rest of their life.”
More than an hour of debate left Raatz on the defensive.
“I agree … we need counselors in the classrooms and social workers to help with the social-emotional needs of the children. There’s no two ways about it. What I disagree with is that we mandate, from this building, that there’s a certain percentage of your time that you have to counsel,” Raatz said in his final remarks. “The sheer thought that we’re pulling things out that’s going to hurt kids — I take offense. … We’re talking about kids’ lives and interaction between individuals. And the more the state gets involved, the more troubles we have.”
The bill advanced from the Senate chamber in a 31-18 vote. Democrats — along with eight Republicans — opposed the legislation, which now returns to the House for final deliberations.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht)With only days remaining in the 2025 Tennessee session, Shelby County lawmakers filed new legislation Tuesday that critics call a “hostile takeover” of Memphis Shelby County Schools by the state.
The bills sponsored by Rep. Mark White of East Memphis and Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County would create a state-appointed board with authority over the locally-elected school board on budgets, contracts, policy and potentially allow district directors and board members to be replaced. White’s bill isn’t to be taken up until the legislature approves a budget for next year, and Taylor’s version was deferred until April 21, then scheduled for Wednesday.










I’m disappointed in the tactics that have been used to gain control of the schools. This wholesale takeover is not good for business.


– Rep. Joe Towns, D-Memphis


Liz Marable, president of United Education Association of Shelby County, called the bills a “worst-case scenario” because the state could subvert voters’ decisions.
“We have so many positive things going on every day in our school district, and the state has shown that they are not in the business of running schools well,” Marable said, referring to the state’s failed Achievement School District. “I just feel like this is another version of the state trying to take over a local school district.”
Democratic Rep. Joe Towns of Memphis labeled the situation a “hostile takeover.” 
“I’m disappointed in the tactics that have been used to gain control of the schools,” Towns said. “This wholesale takeover is not good for business.”
Towns acknowledged he isn’t satisfied with students’ performance, but he said if the state starts overseeing Memphis schools, it could broaden that to cover every district in Tennessee.  
Tennessee planning $6 million audit of Memphis Shelby schools

Memphis leaders have been fighting the proposal for months, even as White has said action is needed to solve a “decades-old issue of underperformance.” 
In addition to the state “takeover,” lawmakers are putting $6 million in next year’s budget for a forensic audit of the school district.
Both bills create a state-appointed oversight board that would oversee operations of low-performing school systems for at least three to four years. The measures don’t name Memphis Shelby County Schools, but the district is clearly the target, even though the law could be used to go after other school districts.
The state-appointed board would hold authority over district budgets, contracts exceeding $50,000 and under-used and vacant school properties. 
Besides establishment of an advisory board, the Senate bill allows the state education commissioner to recommend that the district director and board members be replaced. The commissioner also could propose schools be put under a charter group.
Under White’s bill, the governor would appoint four members and the speakers of the House and Senate would select two members each, all of whom must reside in the school district’s county. The Senate version would give state leaders seven appointments and allow the Shelby County mayor or a designee to serve on the board. Under that version, the board would remain in place for at least four years and would end only if the state education commissioner decides the school district has made “sufficient progress.”
Tennessee lawmakers push Memphis-Shelby schools takeover

In addition to veto authority over district budgets, the oversight board would be able to override the regular elected school board’s decision to turn down charter school applications.
Both bills would kick in if 50% of students fail to meet grade-level standards in math and English; 30% of schools receive a “D” or “F” from the state Department of Education; 25% of students are chronically absent, and at least one school school is identified as a “priority” school for poor performance, and the local elected body declares it has no confidence in the school board. 
The Senate version is markedly different, requiring the oversight board to make a comprehensive study of the school district and recommend a “transformation plan,” including goals the district should meet. The review would cover everything from policies and disciplinary incidents to financial statements and accounting principles. The advisory board’s meetings would be closed to the public, except for the meeting in which it adopts final recommendations.
The advisory board would be able to hire up to three staff members for assistance, and they would be paid by the school district, not the state. Under both bills, the board would be paid by the local district.

Jared Polis to defend the state against actions — including legal proceedings, funding freezes and investigations — from the Trump administration.
“This is a special circumstance where this state needs flexibility to do everything we can and be able to fight, to defend our state and to draw down federal tax dollars that our good citizens have paid into the coffers of Washington, D.C,. and pull those funds back into Colorado,” said bill sponsor Rep.

The money would be appropriated from the state’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act cash fund, which was created in 2022 to bank state money to match federal dollars available through that Biden-era law, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The governor’s office would also be able to accept grants and donations for the legal fund.
The chamber gave preliminary approval to House Bill 25-1321, which needs to pass on a final recorded vote before heading to the Senate.
Specifically, the money could be used to pay for staff and contractors to defend against threats to obligated federal funding owed to the state, or reimburse the Colorado attorney general’s office for the work. The money could also be used to defend state employees in criminal proceedings if that need arises.
The bill comes after President Donald Trump issued a sweeping federal funding freeze in January in order to evaluate if the spending aligned with White House policy goals, which sowed confusion in how the state could pay for programs like Medicaid, early childhood education and grant-reliant services absent federal dollars.
A federal court later blocked the freeze and that decision was upheld by an appeals court, but the administration is still undertaking a broad effort to slash government spending and grant funding, especially for institutions that don’t bow to administration demands.
About one-third of the state’s annual budget comes from federal funding, and there is uncertainty about future cuts or other adverse actions by the federal government.
“We know there are going to be unlawful attempts to withhold money from our state. The only way we can defend against those unlawful attempts is to go to court. That costs money,” Rep. Bob Marshall, a Highlands Ranch Democrat, said.
Attorney General Phil Weiser signed on to the lawsuit challenging the federal funding freeze. He also joined a lawsuit earlier this month challenging the cancellation of about $230 million in public health cuts to the state.
“We are in uncharted territory, where federal funding has been frozen, and we have examples of that with Medicaid, (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and numerous independent grants. We need to have the flexibility to respond to protect the state’s interests. It is very concerning and should be to all of us,” McCluskie said.
House Republicans have repeatedly offered amendments on bills this session to invalidate a policy if it results in loss of federal funding. All of those amendments have been defeated.
“This is our own doing that we’re losing federal funding because of the bills that we’re passing here. We have tried to run amendments on these bills that say if they impact our federal funding, it will be null. This body has voted those down,” said Rep. Carlos Barron, a Fort Lupton Republican.
The state has not lost federal funding as a direct result of any bill this year, but Republicans argue that some bills involving firearm restrictions, immigration and gender affirming care protections could jeopardize that.

Reporting Highlights

Broken Promises: A Trump administration freeze of funds designated to help new refugees is causing chaos for families and forcing nonprofits to cut promised services.
Frustrated Families: Immigrants receiving less help from caseworkers are struggling to find work and navigate health care systems.
Overwhelmed Volunteers: Church members and other volunteers are filling some gaps, but they don’t have the same resources as the aid agencies that used to do this work.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. Were they helpful?



When Max Rykov started reading a Jan. 24 letter sent to the leaders of the country’s 10 refugee resettlement agencies, he found the wording vague but ominous. The agencies were ordered to “stop all work” funded by the Department of State and “not incur any new costs.”
At first, he wondered if the order from the Trump administration was only targeting refugee work in other countries. Rykov, then the director of development and communications at a refugee resettlement partner in Nashville, began texting colleagues at other agencies. “What does it mean?” he asked.
By Monday, three days after the memo, it became clear. The Nashville International Center for Empowerment, along with similar nonprofits across the country, would not have access to the money the government had promised to refugees for their first three months in the United States. That day, NICE laid off 12 of its 56 resettlement staff members and scrambled to free up funds to pay for the basic needs of nearly 170 people dependent on the frozen grants.
Rykov knew exactly what was at stake, and that delivered an additional dose of dread. Born in the former USSR, he and his family arrived in the U.S. as refugees in 1993, fleeing the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economic devastation and discrimination against Soviet Jews. He was 4 years old, and it was bewildering. Though his family was part of one of the largest waves of refugee resettlement in U.S. history, they ended up in a place with few Russian immigrants.

Life in Birmingham, Alabama, a post-industrial city shaped by the Civil Rights movement and white flight, revolved around Saturday college football games and Sunday church. Rykov said his family felt “barren” in the U.S. away from their culture. Birmingham’s Jewish community was small and the Russian population tiny.
But a local Jewish organization sponsored the Rykovs and paired them with a “friendship family.” The group rented them an apartment and furnished it. Then the organization helped Rykov’s parents find work. And Birmingham’s Jewish community banded together to fund scholarships for Rykov and other Soviet refugee children to attend a private Jewish school, where Rykov felt less isolated.
He went on to attend the University of Alabama and overcame his feeling of otherness. After graduation, he found purpose in bringing people together through his work organizing cultural events, including arts festivals and an adult spelling bee, doing social media outreach for the Birmingham mayor and, in 2021, finding a dream job at a Nashville nonprofit devoted to the very efforts that he believes helped define him.
When Rykov heard that President Donald Trump’s second administration had ordered cuts to the refugee program, his thoughts raced to the Venezuelan refugee family his organization was assisting, an older woman in poor health, her daughter who cared for her and the daughter’s two children, one not yet kindergarten age. None of them spoke English, and there was no plan for how they would cover the rent, which was due in four days.
“This is a promise that we made to these people that we have reneged on,” he said. “Is that really what’s happening? Yeah, that’s exactly what’s happening.”
As the realization of what lay ahead set in, Rykov started to cry.
Over the next two months, the Trump administration carried out and defended its destabilizing cuts to the refugee program. The moves brought wave after wave of uncertainty and chaos to the lives of refugees and those who work to help resettle them.
One of the largest nonprofit agencies that carry out this work, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, laid off a third of its staff in February and said Monday that it would end all of its refugee efforts with the federal government. A Jewish resettlement organization, HIAS, cut 40% of its staff. As the groups fight legal battles to recoup the millions of dollars the government owes them, some have been forced to close resettlement offices entirely.
The Nashville International Center for Empowerment is still struggling to keep its own afloat. Although NICE staff members had anticipated some cuts to refugee programs under Trump, they said they were caught off guard when reimbursements for money already spent failed to appear and by the dwindling opportunities to seek recourse.
After a judge ordered the Trump administration to restart refugee admissions, the administration responded by canceling contracts with existing resettlement agencies and announcing plans to find new partners. And the administration has indicated it will remain resistant, refusing to spend millions appropriated by Congress for refugees.
“Many have lost faith and trust in the American system because of this,” said Wooksoo Kim, director of the Immigrant and Refugee Research Institute at the University of Buffalo. “For many refugees, it may start to feel like it’s no different from where they came from.”
In court documents, lawyers for the Department of Justice argued the U.S. does not have the capacity to support large numbers of refugees.
“The President lawfully exercised his authority to suspend the admission of refugees pending a determination that ‘further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States,’” the motion said.
In Nashville, that anxiety has been playing out week after week in tear-filled offices and in apartment complexes teeming with families who fled war and oppression.
Rykov couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by the extreme shift in attitudes about immigrants in just a few years. In 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, his family’s dormant fears about Russia were reawakened — but they felt a surge of pride for the U.S. when it stepped up to help Ukraine and welcome its refugees.
Months after the invasion, Ukrainian athletes came to Birmingham for the World Games, which is similar to the Olympics. When they entered the stadium waving the Ukrainian flag, the crowd gave them a standing ovation. His parents, who’d never felt quite at home in the U.S., loudly joined in the “U-S-A” chant that followed.
But now, three years later, was all of America now ready to abandon refugees? Rykov was starting to see the signs, but he refused to believe it and instead recommitted himself to the work.
He and his colleagues reached out to every donor in their network and called an online meeting with local churches who might be able to help with rent payments, food, job searches and transportation.
Agencies would struggle without the help of the churches. And churches don’t have the resources, training or bandwidth to carry out the work of the agencies.
But Rykov knew that for the time being, he’d need more help than ever from church volunteers.
“Without your intervention here, this is gonna be a humanitarian disaster in Nashville,” he told them in the online meeting held about a week after the cuts. “And in every community, obviously, but we were focusing on ours. We’re not gonna be in a position to help in the same way much longer, and this is a stark reality that we’re facing.”
Then he went on the local news, warning that “this immediate funding freeze puts those recently arrived refugees really at risk of homelessness.” The responses on social media reflected the hate and intolerance that had polluted the national conversation about immigration.
“The common theme was, ‘Refugees? Do you mean “illegal invaders”?’” Rykov recalled. “People are so completely misinformed, clearly not reading the article or watching the story, and it’s very disappointing to see that. And I guess it’s sad too that I expect it.”
One Month After the Cuts
 “No Time to Screw Around”

In late February, church volunteer Abdul Makembe and a program manager from NICE squeezed into the cramped apartment of a family of five from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Both Makembe and NICE had been working with the family for months, but with the loss of funding, NICE could no longer offer support and had asked Makembe to be more involved.
A native of Tanzania, Makembe moved to Tennessee in the late 1970s. After working in infectious disease research and nonprofit management, which involved several trips to Africa, he retired in 2015 and began volunteering to help newly arrived African families. Rykov came to know him as a fixture of the refugee community, always eager to help.
In the apartment, Makembe perched on the edge of a couch and Mungaga Akilimali sat across from him on the floor.
“So, the situation has improved a little bit?” Makembe asked.
The Congolese man ran his hands over his head.
“The situation, so far, not yet,” Akilimali said. “I’m just trying to apply and reapply and reapply, but so far nothing.”
Akilimali and his family fled the Democratic Republic of Congo more than 10 years ago. Since 1996, soldiers and militias have killed 6 million people there and committed atrocities against countless civilians. War, political instability and widespread poverty have displaced millions of others.

Akilimali and his wife settled for a time in South Africa, where they encountered xenophobia and anti-immigrant violence. Immigrants and refugees have become political scapegoats there, spawning a rash of attacks and even murders. His wife, Bulonza Chishamara, nearly died there in 2018 after an ambush by an anti-immigrant mob.
Doctors gave her eight units of blood and Chishamara spent days paralyzed in a hospital bed, Akilimali said. She still walks with a limp.
The family had rejoiced when they got approved for refugee resettlement in 2024 in Tennessee. Their new life in Nashville began with promise. Akilimali, who speaks fluent English and trained as a mechanic, got a driver’s license and a job at Nissan.
However, he lost the job before his probationary period ended due to layoffs, and he hasn’t been able to find another one. NICE used to have a robust staff of employment specialists. But the cuts forced the organization to reassign them.
That left fewer resources for people like Akilimali, who had been in the U.S. longer than the three months during which new refugees were eligible for state department aid but who still needed help finding work.
For Rykov, the work of spreading awareness about the cuts and raising funds to offset them intensified throughout February. He and others working with refugees across the country were hoping that the courts might force the administration to release the federal money — that if they could keep things afloat in the short term, relief would come.
Then, on Feb. 25, a federal judge in Washington ruled in favor of the agencies. He ordered the administration to restore payments and restart refugee admissions.
The relief was short-lived. A day later, the administration canceled contracts with resettlement agencies, and lawyers for the administration have appealed the order. Their argument: The gutted refugee agencies no longer have capacity to restart resettlement, making it impossible to comply with court orders.
Rykov said some of the diminished number of remaining staff members began to look for new jobs.
After that, Rykov and his team kicked into emergency mode. They worked long hours making phone calls and arranging meetings with potential volunteers and donors.
“It was a cocktail of emotions,” he said. The generosity of donors and volunteers filled him with gratitude. But he couldn’t escape the sense of foreboding that consumed the office, where many desks sat empty and remaining employees voiced deepening concerns about the fates of their clients.
Rykov likened the urgent energy at NICE to the aftermath of a natural disaster. “There’s no time to screw around.”
At the same time, staffers worried about the cratering budget and the future of the organization. And it was hard not to notice how much the mood in Tennessee and around the country was shifting. In an order suspending refugee admissions, Trump described immigrants as a “burden” who have “inundated” American towns and cities.NICE had always felt protected, powered by an idealistic and diverse staff who chose to work in refugee resettlement despite the long hours and low pay. The cuts and the discourse eroded that sense of safety, Rykov said.
In February, a tech company offered him a job in Birmingham. It was a chance to be closer to his parents and back in the city where he’d come of age — a reminder of an era that felt kinder than the current one. He took the job.
“Working at NICE, it’s the best job I ever had and the most meaningful job I ever had,” he said.
Rykov packed up a few things from NICE. A Ukrainian flag lapel pin. A signed photograph of him and his coworkers. In his Birmingham apartment, he placed the picture on a bookshelf next to one of him and his parents at his high school graduation.
By the time he left, NICE’s refugee resettlement team was down to 30 employees; it had been 56 before the cuts. For its part, NICE has vowed to carry on. The organization has paired 24 families with volunteer mentors since the funding cuts.
Church volunteers, who were accustomed to helping furnish and decorate apartments for new arrivals, now had to help prevent evictions. They had to track down documents and help complete paperwork lost in the confusion of the nonprofit’s layoffs. And the group of mostly retired professionals now had to assist with the daunting task of finding unskilled jobs for refugees who didn’t speak much English.
Two Months After the Cuts
 One Volunteer, Many People in Need

On a mid-March morning, Makembe woke at 6 a.m. to begin tackling his volunteer work for NICE. Despite the long hours he clocks volunteering, the 74-year-old has kept his energy level and his spirits up. As he left the garage apartment he shares with his wife in a rough north Nashville neighborhood, he made sure to double-check the locks.
On this day, he was working not with the Akilimali family but with a family of four who recently arrived from Africa. The child needs to see a specialist at the Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt.
It was Vanderbilt that brought Makembe to Nashville decades ago, for his master’s degree in economic planning. He followed that with a doctorate in health policy and research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Over the years that followed, he made repeated trips back to Tanzania to do research on malaria and parasitic infections.
All that took a toll on Makembe’s marriage, and he and his first wife divorced when his two children were very young. They are now grown and successful. His son is an accountant and his daughter recently finished law school and works at a firm in New York. That leaves him more time to spend with refugees.
But the volunteer work does bring some financial stress. He is trying to save $5,000 to apply for a green card for his wife, which is tough. Because he spent much of his career working outside the U.S., Makembe receives less than $1,000 a month from Social Security. He drives a 2004 Toyota that was donated to his church to aid the congregation’s work with refugees, but he pays out of pocket for gas and car insurance. The costs can add up. It’s not uncommon for him to burn a quarter tank of gas a day when he is volunteering.
Makembe’s church, Woodmont Hills Church, is a significant contributor to the city’s refugee resettlement work — an ethos shared by its current congregants but that has led to the loss of members over the years. Though it had a congregation nearing 3,000 members in the late ’90s, attendance shrank as the church’s ideology grew more progressive and Tennessee’s grew more conservative. It’s now down to 800 members.
Yet the church remained steadfast in its commitment to helping refugees. Its leaders invited NICE to hold classes in its empty meeting rooms and made space to house a Swahili church and a Baptist church formed by refugees from Myanmar. And when NICE lost funding, Woodmont Hills members donated their time and money.
Makembe has helped dozens of refugees over the years but was particularly worried for the family he had to take to the Children’s Hospital that March morning, serving as both driver and translator. They arrived right before Trump cut off funding, and they had struggled to get medical care for their 5-year-old’s persistent seizures. A doctor at a local clinic had prescribed antiseizure medication, but it didn’t work, and the child experienced episodes where his muscles tensed and froze for minutes at a time.
Nashville has world-class medical facilities, but NICE no longer had staff available to help the family understand and navigate that care, leaving them frustrated.
It took months for the family to get in to see a specialist. During the long wait, Makembe said, the boy’s father began to lose hope. His son’s seizures had become longer and more frequent. Makembe stepped in to help them get a referral from a doctor at the local clinic.
The child’s father had to miss the doctor’s appointment that March morning so that he could go to an interview at a company that packages computer parts. Both he and his wife had been searching for jobs and striking out. Makembe has tried to help but has run into barriers. He does not have the same connections with labor agencies that NICE staffers did.
Makembe said he wants to get the child enrolled in a special school for the fall and find a wheelchair so his mom won’t have to carry him.
And that’s just this family. Makembe said new refugees have been waiting for months to get job interviews. When he visits the five families he mentors, their neighbors approach him asking for help. Many of their requests are for the assistance NICE and other refugee agencies once offered.
“I’m very much worried,” he said. “I mean, they have no idea of what to do.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250226-Gray-DOGE-Tennessee-Refugee-Cuts-11-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-16 07:05:48.030069

Mike Crapo (center) takes part in a listening breakfast at the Idaho State Capitol Building in Boise on June 2, 2017. (Lance Cheung/USDA)U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in an April 8 op-ed that “access to affordable housing is one of the most pressing issues” he encounters across Idaho. 
He has asked that Idahoans participate in a housing survey so he can develop policy solutions. The senator is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over issues that can profoundly affect housing in Idaho – trade, taxes, Medicaid and Social Security. He could actually have a tremendously positive effect on housing availability in the Gem State, merely by using his clout on this powerful committee, without needing a survey.
Donald Trump’s tariffs pose a serious threat to affordable housing by substantially increasing the costs of construction, remodeling and mortgage financing. 
Crapo could immediately join a bipartisan effort to take back the Constitutional power of Congress to regulate trade and tariffs. Congressional approval of Senate Joint Resolution 49 would terminate the tariffs, allowing Congress to target China with tariffs in specific industries where they would do some actual good. 
Crapo held an April 8 hearing on trade policy, but gave no indication he supported the resolution or any other means of stopping Trump’s tariff chaos. Crapo needs to hear from voters on the necessity of legislative action to prevent harmful tariff-related escalation of housing costs.
As chairman of the Finance Committee, Crapo should shoot down the false claims of Elon Musk that the Social Security system is a “Ponzi scheme” riddled with fraud. Musk has failed to provide an iota of proof. Someone in a position of authority should tell him to provide proof or shut his trap. 
Social Security is a lifeline for elderly Americans who contributed to the system. Many live from check to check, depending on those payments to stay in their homes or apartments. As Musk has rifled through the private personal information of older Americans, he is causing the system to break down. If retired folk lose their housing as a result of his misconduct, there really will be a crisis.
The Republicans in Congress seem intent on savaging another program that provides housing to senior citizens of modest means. Medicaid is the primary payer source for 65% of the residents in Idaho’s certified nursing facilities. If Crapo and other GOP members of Congress cut $880 billion out of the Medicaid program to finance tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, it is not clear where those folks will find alternate housing.
Strangely, Crapo’s April 8 op-ed transitions from housing affordability to the issue of those tax cuts for the rich. Crapo is desperate to permanently extend the 2017 tax cut law that was massively skewed in favor of the top one percent. 
It has been reliably estimated that extension of the tax cuts without commensurate cuts in spending would add $4.5 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years and $37 trillion by 2054. The debt currently stands at $36 trillion. 
The richest 5% of Americans would receive 40% of the benefits of extension in the first year alone. 
Sen. Crapo has been the leading advocate for a smoke-and-mirrors budget policy that would essentially ignore the fact that spending would exceed revenue by more than $4 trillion over 10 years. Crapo is championing the “current policy baseline” that essentially overlooks the effect of adding unlimited years to the 2017 tax cuts. 
Prominent GOP budget experts say it would be a “recipe for disaster, a fiscal Pandora’s box.” The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has called the scheme “ a blueprint for miring us in even more debt.” 
It may be that Crapo is merely looking out for the housing interests of the super rich, making sure that they have opulent housing options around the globe. For the ordinary American, the tax scheme does not offer much tax relief, and it certainly does nothing to address the affordable housing issue.
Were Congress to adopt Crapo’s fiscally-irresponsible budget gimmick, borrowing cost would rise out of sight, endangering everyone’s access to reasonable mortgage rates for housing. With the burgeoning national debt and reluctance of investors to continue financing America’s massive and growing debt, lending rates for housing will likely rise above the reach of most Americans.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution Tuesday opposing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents “operating outside the limits of the law in and around the Milwaukee County Courthouse Complex,” while also calling on the sheriff to work with the county executive and chief judge of the First Judicial District to “ensure access to services and safeguard every individual’s constitutional right to due process.” 
During the board committee meeting Chairwoman Marcelia Nicholson called the resolution, which she authored with Supervisors Caroline Gomez-Tom and Juan Miguel Martinez, both “reactive” and “proactive.” The resolution also calls for Milwaukee County residents to be educated on their rights during immigration encounters, such as distributing educational material around the courthouse complex.

“Let me be clear,” Nicholson said, “everyone regardless of immigration status deserves due process. And that’s not a radical idea, that’s the Constitution. And yet when federal immigration enforcement takes place in our courthouse complex, it sends families into hiding, deters survivors of violence from seeking protection and discourages tenants from asserting their rights.” Nicholson said that “it erodes trust in the very systems we are responsible for upholding.”
In early April, the community learned of two ICE arrests in the county courthouse. The Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office said in a press statement that ICE had not given prior notice of one of the arrests and that the sheriff’s office was not involved in making the arrests. Days later, the men were identified as Edwin Bustamante-Sierre, 27, and Marco Cruz-Garcia, 24. ICE said that the men had been convicted of violent crimes or were linked to gangs. Online court records show that one of the men, Cruz-Garcia, was arrested the same day he went to family court for a domestic violence-related restraining order, which was dropped that day. 
Nicholson said the arrests took place in the “public hallways of our courthouse and Safety Building.” She added, “That action didn’t just detain individuals, it delivered a message: ‘This space may not be safe for people who look a certain way, or speaks a certain language.’” 
The arrests were widely condemned by local officials and activists. Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a statement that the courthouse “stands as a cornerstone of justice where residents come to seek information, resources and fair participation in the legal process” and that “an attack on this safe, community-serving space undermines public trust, breeds fear among citizens and staff and disrupts the due process essential to our courts.” 
Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley, as well as members of the Board of Supervisors also decried the arrests. Local groups from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin to Voces de la Frontera, and the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression also blasted ICE for making arrests in the courthouse.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The ACLU highlighted that ICE enforcement often causes immigrant communities to avoid contacting law enforcement, even when they are in danger of becoming crime victims. On April 10, Congresswoman Gwen Moore said in a statement that “ICE has seemingly front-run Milwaukee’s justice system, potentially denying the city justice and potential victims a remedy.” Moore added, “This Administration’s decision to remove sensitive location protections will stir even more fear in our communities, prevent victims of crime from coming forward, and disrupt houses of worship, schools, and hospitals.”
In a joint statement Nicholson, Gomez-Tom, and Miguel Martinez said that the resolution “puts us on the right side of history and the right side of humanity.” The resolution is “about helping people … protection process…[and] protecting the promise of what our Courthouse is meant to be – a place of fairness, access, and truth.” 
During public testimony on Tuesday, Sup. Willie Johnson Jr. said that he agreed that the arrests “were an erosion of trust”. Echoing Nicholson’s words Johnson said that “we are stewards of Milwaukee County government, we represent the citizens of this county and we should be respectful of the rights of people to go about their business, be where they need to be, and do what they need to do.” 
Sup. Miguel Martinez said “this is just the first step towards creating more action.” The board is expecting a report back from the sheriff and county executive regarding rules around the courthouse, he  said.
“This administration really is descending into 1939 Nazi Germany,” Miguel Martinez continued. “And I’m not saying that with hyperbole because there’s people that are getting deported and people that are citizens, and are not returning. We have people with residency getting their residency stripped away from them. And every single day, it descends into more and more madness.”
He said that it was the responsibility of board members “as local representatives of our communities, that we make sure that we fight every single day against this unlawful administration, and make sure that we let everybody know that we are here to protect them, and we won’t let our country descend into absolute tyrannical madness.”
Sup. Gomez-Tom added that it is the county government’s responsibility “to serve our community, and all inhabitants of our county.” Milwaukee County residents go to the courthouse for many different services besides the justice system, including victim services, child support or obtaining legal documents, “and everyone should have a right to do so, and to do so in peace,” said Gomez-Tom.

Supervisors Anne O’Connor said that to her knowledge, the Trump administration is the first to pursue immigration arrests in what were once considered “safe places” such as courthouses or churches. 
At a press conference she attended in the days after the arrests, O’Connor said, ICE agents were parked illegally outside and wouldn’t identify themselves further. She described the feeling as “a cloak of anonymity” and said her constituents are concerned about vulnerable communities such as resettled Afghan-U.S. allies, Rohingya, and Congolese communities who get services from nonprofits.
Sup. Patti Logsdon abstained from voting on the resolution’s passage, saying her decision “is not a reflection of indifference or opposition to the values of justice or fairness,” but concern about the legal uncertainty surrounding the passing and implications of this resolution.” 
Logsdon asked for legal guidance as to what policies the county has in place already to guide ICE interactions, as well as the legal jeopardy elected officials who support policies that could conflict with federal immigration law may find themselves. Logsdon also questioned whether Milwaukee County could be sued for going against immigration enforcement, who would pay for it and how much it would cost “in defending and educating undocumented immigrants about their rights.”
Several members of the public also attended the board meeting, expressing support for the resolution, concern for immigrant communities and opposition to  Trump administration immigration policies.
Gomez-Tom noted that she is the daughter of Mexican immigrants.  “I know what that chilling effect looks like when someone in your family is at risk…maybe isn’t even at risk, but is scared that they could be at risk of being detained, of being questioned,” she said. “What happens is people get paralyzed.”

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.
“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
Debate headed for ballot
In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
 

“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
Targeting marijuana potency, revenues
In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
 

“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.

In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

This effort involves parole and probation agencies, social service providers, work-release employers, and support from the community.” — Joe Thornton, former Secretary of the West Virginia Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety (DMAPS) 
West Virginia is sometimes unfairly criticized by outsiders that are unaware of the state’s many positives, such as its friendly people and beautiful, scenic mountains. But even the state’s residents may not be aware of some of West Virginia’s other accomplishments. For example, the successful rehabilitation of people exiting state prisons. 
A recent report by Suzuki Law found that West Virginia’s recidivism rate is lower than all but four states. This positive finding is consistent with a PEW survey taken more than a decade ago which also found West Virginia to have the fourth lowest recidivism rate. 
More broadly, the American criminal justice system must do more than just say “goodbye” to discharged inmates; it must take pro-active steps to help with a very difficult transition. As indicated below, such action results in all of us being safer and lessens our tax burden.
 A large portion of the world’s total inmates are here in the United States, where almost a half million new inmates enter the system each year. Currently, we have nearly 2 million people incarcerated, the majority in state prisons at tremendous cost to state taxpayers. And 1 out of 5 are in jail due to mostly non-violent drug offenses. 
States like West Virginia with lower recidivism rates have more effective programs for dealing with people convicted of crimes and eventually released. While West Virginia’s 24% recidivism rate may sound high to the uninformed, it is less than half that of Delaware (65%), the highest state. And West Virginia’s historically lower rate did not simply happen by accident, prison reform has been a priority for a while.  
In 2013 and 2015, Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin and West Virginia’s Legislature made a very conscious decision to identify and employ “scientifically validated” “best practices” to improve the state’s justice system, for both youth and adults. In a rare illustration of how government can — and should — work, both the GOP and the Democrats agreed on the need for reform. Then, together, they accomplished it, all without pointing fingers as is so common in 2025.  
Senate Bill 371 (2013) enacted reforms regarding the adult offender system. The Justice Reinvestment Initiative employed assessment and treatment of “behavioral health and substance abuse” to reduce recidivism. Instead of incarceration, the state established “day report centers,” successfully utilizing “treatment and recovery services” versus incarceration. 
Senate Bill 393 (2015) zeroed in on “at-risk youth” where they lived, providing them with home-based guidance and mentoring. Previously, these children were committed to youth detention facilities, i.e. jails. As a state planning and budgeting senior analyst, I visited and evaluated such facilities in Georgia in the 1970s. I guarantee you that they were problematic, as well as personally disturbing. 
It is a true shame that other red and blue states with high recidivism rates — such as Delaware, Alaska, Arkansas, Rhode Island and Colorado — have not come together to install scientifically based reforms that have been proven to be successful in West Virginia and other more enlightened states. Per one legal expert, “By adopting evidence-based rehabilitation programs and supporting former inmates in their transition back into society, we can reduce recidivism rates, improve public safety, and ease the economic burden on taxpayers.” 
High recidivism can be reduced by providing inmate educational and rehabilitation opportunities, and support after release from prison including employment assistance, housing and education. But the first step is to recognize that there is a problem. 
Jim Rubenstein, a past WVDOC Commissioner, once stated, “I am proud of our staff’s commitment to the WVDOC’s goal of reducing offender recidivism.” Mr. Rubenstein, everyone reading this column will agree. I just hope other states will follow in your footsteps.

LITTLE ROCK — Crop-related flood damage in Arkansas from early April rains totals a “conservative” $78.9 million, according to estimates from the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.
Of the nearly 840,000 acres reported planted as of April 7 in the state, 31% was reported as flooded, and agronomists and economists warn additional acreage may flood as water moves downstream.
From April 2-6, Arkansas and parts of the Mid-South endured a series of storms culminating in what the National Weather Service labeled “generational” flooding. With more than a foot of rain falling in some locations, moderate and major flooding occurred along the Cache, Black, White and Ouachita rivers. Water levels along those rivers were not expected to decline significantly through April 18.
The UA System analysis estimated the total replanting expenses from flooded acres for corn, rice and soybeans to be $42.04 million. The estimated replanting cost per commodity is:

Corn — $11.44 million
Rice — $20.91 million
Soybeans — $9.68 million.

Winter wheat damaged by flooding won’t be replanted, and with fertilizer and other inputs already invested in the crop, wheat growers will still face production losses and sunk cost of production. This places the loss for wheat at around $18 million, the analysis said.
The value of federal crop insurance indemnities — the amount insurance would pay back to farmers — is estimated at $18.69 million.
Agriculture is the state’s largest industry, valued at more than $24 billion.
The Division of Agriculture released a fact sheet on Tuesday outlining these preliminary damage calculations. Agricultural economists and agronomists from the Division of Agriculture made their calculations based on observations from county Cooperative Extension Service agents.

“We recognize that this is likely a conservative estimate as we have not accounted for yield loss resulting from late planting, damage to farm structures such as grain bins, and unreported acreage that is flooded,” said Hunter Biram, extension economist for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.
“We note that these losses are one-third of the projected economic assistance to be received by Arkansas crop producers highlighting the significance of this flood event in the face of multi-year declines in net farm income and heightened market volatility.”
When calculating the total damage costs, planting expenses are estimated using operating costs from the 2025 University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture crop enterprise budgets, said Ryan Loy, extension economist for the Division of Agriculture.
“Only cost items such as seed, fertilizer, herbicides, labor and diesel are incurred when replanting a crop, while the remaining operating expenses — including crop insurance, interest and cash rent — are only incurred in the initial planting.”
Deacue Fields, head of the Division of Agriculture who is also an agricultural economist, said the damage assessment is critical to help obtain aid for affected farmers.
“We created this assessment to help our farmers and are sharing our findings with Gov. [Sarah Huckabee] Sanders and the U.S. Department of Agriculture,” he said, “Both are in a position to help the people of Arkansas agriculture through this very difficult time.
“We truly appreciate the speed at which our agents and faculty collected and processed this information under very difficult conditions,” Fields said.
The Division of Agriculture will conduct additional surveys to further refine the damage estimate.

Along the lower White River, the National Weather Service posted flood warnings until further notice.
Last week, Craighead County rice farmer Joe Christian posted an aerial photo of his farm on X, which showed the vast scale of the flooding. In it, the white roof of a storage shed surrounded by acres of brown water, with a few trees and outlines of fields visible.
Satellite analysis
Jason Davis, assistant professor remote sensing and pesticides application and extension specialist, was analyzing satellite imagery of the flooding to be paired and validated against ground observations made by extension agents.
“We’re one of the very few organizations that can do this,” Davis said. “With our direct connection to producers through both specialists and the county extension agents we are one of the very few organizations in the state that have the network to do this kind of validation with such a quick turnaround.”
For his analysis, Davis has downloaded imagery of 11 million acres in Arkansas’ Delta. The images are multispectral, so in addition to visible light, he has near-infrared images which can be used to “show very clearly where the water is.”
Using the visible and near-infrared images to create false color imagery, all water — “even the really turbid water that may look similar to soil in visible spectrum imagery, pops as fluorescent blue so it can be differentiated as flooded.”
Davis said he will also produce a “quantified map of where the water is pixel by pixel, so we can calculate the number of flooded acres by that. I use those two methods to calculate and validate where the water is.”
Davis said he overlays the satellite imagery with maps from the National Agricultural Statistics Service showing “where crop fields are and what commodity that field was planted in each year.”  While the NASS data is from 2024, agronomists and economists can use these numbers as a baseline to adjust estimates based on what was planted and crop rotations.
Rice
The problem plaguing all farmers right now is uncertainty as water drains southward.
“We are still so much in the middle of this insanity,” said Jarrod Hardke, extension rice agronomist for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. In the next few days,  “there is ground where the water is coming off and ground that is just now going under.”
The rising water won’t be dramatic like the original flood event, but farmers “will just start to see water getting deeper every day,” he said.
In the Payneway community, “they started sandbagging it last Wednesday, expecting it to flood this coming Wednesday,” Hardke said Monday. “They’re having to read the tea leaves about when and how this is all going to play out.”
Complicating the predictions are the different rates at which the rivers — all tributaries of the Mississippi River — drain.
“There’s the expectation that when the Mississippi River crest gets to Helena, that they’re going to need to protect the Mississippi River levees. They’ll be turning off their pumps and that means a lot of the water we’re draining out of the St. Francis and other rivers is going to start to back up.”
As for a rice redo, “we know we have a ton of levy damage and impacts. Tearing down and rebuilding damaged levees — that’s a substantial investment of time and money,” Hardke said.
“There is actually a little bit of replant seed available — seed that was deliberately held back for that purpose,” Hardke said. “But it’s going to be hit or miss depending on the type of rice they need.”
Soybeans
Jeremy Ross, extension soybean agronomist for the Division of Agriculture, said the high moisture levels left by the flooding are causing seedling diseases in stands that have emerged.
However, “we are still in the heart of the optimum planting window,” he said. “With less than 15 percent of the crop planted, there’s still time to maximize yield.”
Growers looking for seed to replant their soybeans may “not get the same variety you had, but you can still get the herbicide technology you’re looking for.
“The way I look at it is the best scenario is cotton and peanuts because nothing has been planted,” Ross said. “Second best is going to be soybeans, just because seed supply is really good.”
Ross cited the case of a grower in east central Arkansas who planted 2,700 acres of soybeans and 300 acres of corn.
“They’re going to have to replant the whole farm because of drowned soybeans and being hit pretty hard with seedling diseases,” Ross said. “But while it’s a bad situation, it could be worse. It’ll be a little more cost to recondition the beds, run the planter and then make an additional herbicide application, but they still have an opportunity to maximize their soybean yield.”
Corn
When it comes to corn, growers are also still within a good planting window, said Jason Kelley, extension wheat and feed grains agronomist for the Division of Agriculture. He said there should be seed available for replanting, but “it’s probably not going to be the grower’s first choice. They might get their second, third or fourth choices.”
Kelley said the late planting date for full crop insurance is April 25 in southern Arkansas and May 1 for northeast Arkansas, so most people are going to be able to get back in the field and replant corn before yields start dropping from late planting.”
Some growers that had corn emerging and plan to replant will have an unusual task: killing the rain-damaged first stand before planting again, since the partial initial stand will act like a weed for the replanted corn.
“A lot of people are probably just going to use tillage to get rid of the first stand as many of the raised beds are eroded down that irrigation later in the season may not be as effective,” Kelley said.
Raised bed erosion is a real issue “Producers may have planted the seed 2 inches deep,” he said. However, when the heavy rains came, “those beds ‘melted down,’ so now that seed isn’t 2 inches deep and it’s not nearly deep enough for proper root development, which can lead to plants falling over and plant loss.
“The silver lining is that if this rain happened a month from now, it would have been even more devasting since now, at least, we have an opportunity to replant corn,” he said.
Wheat
Kelley said, “Unfortunately for the wheat crop, we’ve got almost all the expenses in it already —seed, fertilizer, herbicides — so we’re basically waiting on harvest,” he said.
“Wheat can handle some water for a couple days like other crops, but the quicker the water recedes, the better,” Kelley said. “If the wheat is heading or in the flowering stage and the flood water is deep enough to go over the heads that would most likely result in blank heads with no grain.”

The proposal, House Bill 636, drew concerns from Democratic representatives over the subjectivity of which books are “harmful to minors” or “pervasively vulgar,” the standard for removal set by the bill, as well as protests from members of the public, some of whom were ejected by the sergeant-at-arms for vocal disruptions.
The bill requires each of the state’s 116 school districts to establish a committee made up of five parents or guardians and five educators tasked with reviewing all school library material for sexual content to determine if it is in violation of the state guidelines, as well as new additions and any book fair offerings. The bill declares any media containing “descriptions or visual depictions of sexual activity” to be inappropriate for all ages and grade levels.
The State Board of Education would be required to maintain a database of all banned media across the state and update it annually. In addition, objections from 10 parents, residents, or teachers would be sufficient to require the review of specific library materials. While the bill leaves final say over what materials should be included in libraries with school governing bodies, it also opens up a private right of action for parents, guardians, and residents to sue over noncompliance with the law by any school.
The bill comes amid a wave of book bans around the country as Republican-controlled legislatures have sought to give parents a veto over the material their children can access at school. In the 2023-24 school year, more than 10,000 instances of book banning took place around the country, PEN America found. Critics of the bans say books on LGBTQ+ and racial topics are disproportionately subject to removal, alleging ideological rather than educational motives for the restrictions.
Rep. Neal Jackson (R-Moore), one of the bill’s primary sponsors, contended that the removal process is “absolutely not book banning,” pointing to Supreme Court precedent that schools may bar any content that are “pervasively vulgar or educationally unsuitable.” He said controlling available library media is critical for parental rights.
“It’s not about fiction books. It’s not about nonfiction books. It’s not about novels,” Jackson said. “Very simply, it’s about pornography and not allowing pornography in our public school libraries.”

But that argument left opponents of the bill unconvinced. Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) said she feared books like Alice Walker’s “The Color Purple,” which depicts a young girl experiencing and overcoming rape, would likely be subject to bans despite their literary and educational value.
“That’s book banning, that’s censorship, that’s one of the all-time great books that kids learn to read with, that they get an interest in,” Morey said, comparing moves to ban controversial media to George Orwell’s “1984.” “I don’t see the line, I see subjectivity, and I’m really, really worried about that. I have very serious concerns that this is total censorship.”
Rep. David Willis (R-Union), another primary sponsor, said books like “The Color Purple” are not the target of the legislation, calling characterization of the bill as a book banning measure “personally offensive.” He said there is a clear legal definition of “what is vulgar, what is obscene, and what is pornography” that does not encompass books with educational merit.
“That is not what this is designed to do and the folks in this committee understand that clearly,” Willis said. “If I were to take one of these books and walk across the mall and sit down with one of the tour groups of kids that come through there every single day and start reading aloud — and start exposing the book and the pictures in these books — it wouldn’t take very long for me to get arrested.”
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) said that despite the lawmakers’ assertion that the bill seeks to protect parental rights, it instead infringes upon them by allowing other parents to block her children’s reading material. She recalled a teacher contacting her because her son, then a fourth grader, was reading “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,” a book that depicts the horrors of the Holocaust.
“It’s my job as the parent, not the school’s and not the government’s, to determine what is appropriate,” Budd said. “This is in fact book banning and a very slippery slope, because what you define as wholesome may not be the same for me.”
HB 636 was also approved the House Rules Committee Tuesday afternoon and is scheduled for a vote before the full House on Wednesday.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-04-16 05:59:13.397100

(Getty Images)Imagine being 35 years old and facing the reality that without the necessary help you would be forced into a nursing home. 
For many people with disabilities who live in Pennsylvania, this is not just a hypothetical — it’s a looming threat.
I’ve received home care since I was 18 years old, and because of it, I’m able to live in my own home, participate in my community, develop my hobbies, and advocate for others with disabilities. 
I live a full life. And that is because I’ve received care in the participant-directed model. This means I get to choose who provides my care and how it is delivered. This autonomy is critical — not only for my personal freedom and well-being but for the overall efficiency of the healthcare system. 
By avoiding agency profits and overhead, the participant-directed care system puts money back in the pockets of our care givers, ensuring state dollars are going where they belong. Investing in participant direction saves the state Medicaid program millions of dollars a year, an important consideration as our community-based service system continues to expand and federal funds become uncertain. 
Despite the vital role our home caregivers play, they remain drastically underpaid and undervalued. This chronic lack of funding threatens the future of self-direction, and self-dignity, for Pennsylvanians like myself.
My caregiver, Lynn provides deeply personal and essential services to me, such as lifting, dressing, and assisting with my hygiene. Even with decades of experience, she struggles to pay medical expenses for herself.
How can we expect caregivers to provide quality care when they are barely surviving financially?
Thankfully, there is recognition at the state level that change needs to occur to make progress. Governor Josh Shapiro’s 2025-26 budget proposal includes $21 million to support participant-directed care so that for the first time ever, caregivers such as Lynn, would receive the financial security they deserve. This includes a wage increase and funding paid time off. 
Participant-directed home care is essential. It is fiscally responsible. And it enables self-determination. Let’s start treating it that way.

(Courtesy the Berglund Center)Autumn Bushman’s age when she killed herself is unfathomable, gut-wrenching. The Roanoke County girl was just 10 years old, and her parents say she’d been bullied – citing that as a key factor in her death. Unfortunately, Autumn’s death reflects a troubling national trend: Children are taking their own lives more frequently.
Her  March 21 suicide in her own home has caused immeasurable grief for her family, and it has stunned a Southwest Virginia community. The incident, brought to wider attention by The Washington Post, should force all of us to grapple with some disturbing questions:
Are Virginia schools intervening sufficiently when bullying or harassment occurs? Are parents equipped with enough tools to discern normal adolescent angst from something more serious – and potentially fatal? Should parents prevent their children from having smartphones because of the constant bombardment of digital conversations that can be mean-spirited and abrasive?
Autumn had a smartphone, but her parents said they didn’t let her have her own social media accounts. Chuck Lionberger, a county schools spokesman, said in a statement the division encourages “parents to not give students access to smart phones and social media until age 14, to closely monitor online interactions, and to report any bullying concerns to the school so that we can work with parents to intervene.”
He also told me that elementary school students aren’t allowed to have cellphones in school.
The presence of smartphones is a key difference between yesteryear and today. Back then, you could put classroom nonsense and threats behind you when you went home. Today, social media and cellphones make that impossible.
Suicide prevention is a priority for me now

One bittersweet development since Autumn’s death: a call from all quarters for kindness, empathy and understanding. That was the message Sunday at the Berglund Center in Roanoke in a celebration of her life that was dedicated, in part, to squashing bullying; 300 people showed up, a center spokesman said. Folks have bought “Be Kind for Autumn” shirts. A forum April 29 in a neighboring county will focus on bullying.
“It seems like there’s a blind eye” toward the problem, Town of Rocky Mount Mayor Holland Perdue, organizer of the forum, told me. He’s been commenting online about the problem for months, and Perdue said some children in his area are being homeschooled now because of bullying.
The Post reported the family opened up Autumn’s funeral to the wider community and broadcast it live, hoping the fourth-grader’s story might inspire more tolerance. The young girl’s hobbies and extracurriculars included cheerleading, track, dance and archery.
A county police spokeswoman said last week the investigation of Autumn’s death is still active, pending the medical examiner’s report. Police also took her smartphone. 
“Police may examine devices to piece together the events leading up to a death,” Amy Whittaker told me by email.
Kids who are bullied are at risk of suicide, but bullying alone is not the cause, according to the government website Stopbullying.gov. “Many issues contribute to suicide risk, including depression, problems at home, and trauma history,” it said.
Yet federal statistics show suicidal thoughts among adolescents have worsened over the period from 2013 to 2023. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, citing a national youth risk survey released last year, said 19% of children in 2023 reported being bullied at school during the past year.
The survey found that in 2023, 16% of students made a suicide plan and 9% attempted suicide. Those numbers were slightly higher than in 2013.
I reached out to health care officials at Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, which operates Children’s Pavilion. That facility, which opened in 2022, provides inpatient pediatric mental health treatment and related services.
Dr. John Fanton, child and adolescent psychiatrist, noted that evaluating mental health illnesses has “come a long way, and we’re doing much more now in terms of screening and educating” and alerting families about risks.
Decades of national suicide prevention policies haven’t slowed the deaths

However, “the science has not evolved to the level where we can do 100% screening 100%  of the time,” Fanton added. “There’s no app, no equivalent of a stress test” that indicates what risk category a child will be in up to a year from now.
Parents should monitor their children’s mood, sleep patterns and changes in eating habits to consider whether something is hugely awry, said Stephanie Osler, director of mental health hospital support.
“If you see sudden changes, as a parent, you need to be vigilant,” added Osler, a licensed clinical social worker. Some changes in behavior might be normal. “But if they’re missing out on things, their grades are dropping, and they’re not as engaged on things they enjoy,” those are red flags, she said.
Both officials lead the mental health emergency department assessment team. They noted the arrival of smartphones and social media have made it tougher for children to distance themselves from external criticism – some of it especially harsh and cruel.
Autumn’s parents, Mark and Summer Bushman, as well as other parents and students in her school division, have questioned whether Roanoke County Public Schools handle complaints about bullying properly, and if the penalties go far enough. The current policy was discussed last week during a county school board meeting.
Summer told The Post she contacted her daughter’s school, Mountain View Elementary, early on to report concerning behavior. But, she said, she never received a clear explanation — only that the situation had been “handled.”
Mark, in another report, said, “As far as we know, what we were told – at least by our daughter – was that (the bullying) kept happening.”  
The division, in a statement spokesman Lionberger emailed to me, says it takes “all reports of bullying and conflicts among students very seriously. Our schools educate students and respond appropriately to specific situations when we are made aware, including working with parents and families of students involved.” He said federal privacy laws prevented him from discussing the specifics of Autumn’s case.
At the School Board meeting, when a division official noted the schools must legally notify parents about bullying accusations, Summer Bushman blurted out: “I was never notified. … My daughter is dead!” 
Lionberger told me later he couldn’t discuss that allegation, again citing federal privacy laws.
Since the 2022-23 school year, he said, the division had collected 72 bullying incidents without injuries, and none with injuries. It had tallied eight complaints of cyberbullying. There were three repeat bullying complaints.
Suicides among Autumn’s age group are low in the commonwealth, but still dispiriting. For ages 8-12, the Virginia Department of Health reported six deaths in 2022, one in 2023 and two in 2024, a spokeswoman said.
Nationally, though, the story has been shocking. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health found rates of suicide in the 8-12 age group have been increasing by approximately 8% annually since 2008, the institute said last year.
NIH noted the overall numbers remain low.
Autumn’s death is a wake-up call. Ask your own children questions about their emotional state. Stay involved with them. Consult counselors and psychiatrists. Know the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988.
Make all of that Autumn’s legacy.

Patients seeking psychiatric treatment sometimes had to wait days in Chesapeake Regional Medical Center’s emergency room for space at facilities across the state to open up, the hospital told the state in 2022.
Now those patients will have their own space on-site dedicated to treating them quickly.
“For far too long, individuals in this region experiencing a mental health crisis have had limited access to focused, immediate and respectful care. Today, that changes,” Amber Egyud, Chesapeake Regionals’ chief operating and nursing officer, said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony April 7 for the hospital’s new psychiatric emergency room.
The room will allow those in need of psychiatric care to get away from the stress of a typical ER and connect directly with appropriate clinical staff.
The first psychiatric emergency room on the south side of Hampton Roads, the effort was partially funded by a competitive $3.7 million state grant and is part of a larger psychiatric emergency program from the hospital.
The ER will start accepting patients in the next few weeks, once the finishing touches are complete. For those who can’t be treated and immediately released in the ER, the hospital plans to open an additional inpatient facility with 20 beds early next year.
The emergency department should reduce the need for police officers to monitor patients, said Chesapeake Police Chief Mark Solesky.
He said it’s not unusual for six or seven police cruisers to be parked at the hospital on any given night, with officers each tending to a different patient. The new ER will require just one officer.
Solesky said the facility “is going to go a long way towards freeing up our officers to go back out to their core services.”

(Photo by Paul Mansfield Photography/ Getty Images)Maine is trying again to catch up with its regional peers by introducing legislation to prioritize donating and recycling food waste, rather than throwing it away. 
The Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee is holding a public hearing Wednesday morning for a bipartisan bill from Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland) that could help address Maine’s mounting trash problem and greenhouse gas emissions by diverting food waste from landfills. Commonly called a food waste ban, Maine attempted similar legislation last session, but it died due to lack of funding. 
Thanks to a first-of-its-kind study in 2024, there is concrete data showing that more than 360,000 tons of food is wasted or lost in Maine annually. While much of that could be recovered to feed the one in eight Mainers who face hunger, it instead rots in landfills creating methane, a harmful greenhouse gas. 
LD 1065 would prohibit significant generators of food waste, which could include schools, hospitals, food producers and others, from disposing of food waste if they are close to a facility that could compost or otherwise dispose of the waste. Like the proposal last session, the bill outlines a gradual approach to expand the requirement based on someone’s location and the amount of waste generated.
If adopted, LD 1065 would initially cover entities that produce an annual average of two or more tons of food waste per week and are located within 20 miles of an organics recycler, starting July 1, 2027. In 2029, those parameters would be reduced to one or more tons per week and within 25 miles of an available recycling facility. 
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection opposed the proposal last session, saying it would require additional staff to help people understand if they are subject to the ban and how to comply. Additionally, the department argued that the state lacks the infrastructure for food waste collection, processing and composting for the ban to be effective.
Brenner’s proposal does not yet have a cost estimate, but the previous bill was estimated to cost upwards of $550,000 for five staff positions and other associated costs for the department. 
Currently, Maine is the only New England state without some version of a food waste ban. Advocates argue that adopting such a prohibition not only offers social and environmental benefits, but is crucial to achieve Maine’s goal of cutting food loss and waste in half by 2030, as outlined in the state’s most recent climate action plan.
Connecticut was the first New England state to pass a food waste law back in 2011. Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island followed suit in the years after, and New Hampshire joined them in 2023.

,Maryland Matters,2025-04-16 09:04:45+00:00,Maryland Matters,Study: Marylanders could save hundreds on electric bills if grid undergoes reform,Christine Condon,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/04/16/pjm-grid-reform-study/,"Maryland ratepayers could save hundreds of dollars a year on their electric bills if the regional power grid operator could speed up approval of energy projects, some of which have languished for five years in the current system.","Contractors complete work on a transmission line ina 2024 file photo from Puerto Rico. (Photo by Dave Palmer/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)Maryland ratepayers could save hundreds of dollars a year on their electric bills if the regional power grid operator could speed up approval of energy projects, some of which have languished for five years in the current system.
That is main finding of a new report on PJM Interconnection, the grid operator that distributes power in Maryland, the District of Columbia and 12 other states, stretching from the mid-Atlantic to parts of Illinois.
The report, released Tuesday by a national environmental nonprofit,  predicts that Maryland households could see an average of $546 in annual savings on their electric bills from 2025 to 2040, with savings peaking at$1,006 a year in 2036 over current practices. The report, by Massachusetts-based research and consulting firm Synapse, predicts that bills across PJM will grow by 60% between now and 2036 with no change in policies; with the changes, bills would actually decrease by 7% in that period.
“Folks probably don’t know much about PJM or what this organization is doing behind the scenes, but it’s about to hit their pocketbooks,” said Charles Harper, senior policy lead for the power sector at Evergreen Collaborative, the environmental nonprofit that commissioned the report.
“So, we wanted to look at what PJM has done to contribute to this problem, by not adding new energy projects efficiently to the electric grid, and to really look forward and look proactively at what reforms we could do now,” he said.
It’s not just PJM. Harper said grid operators around the country are feeling the pinch of a “new paradigm.”
“Historically, maybe a few large power plants would be in the queue and would need to be studied. But now, a hundred smaller solar, wind and storage projects are in the queue instead,” Harper said.
As demand for AI rises, so do power-thirsty data centers

The slow pace of approvals is no longer suitable in a world where the demand for energy is soaring, driven by data centers that require massive amounts of power, including those in Northern Virginia, a data center hotbed. Between 2025 and 2040, energy load growth is expected to increase by 72%, and data centers will account for the majority of that increase.
“That status quo of approving projects slowly is no longer tenable, because it’s starting to lead to massive cost increases,” Harper said.
But studies have shown that PJM is particularly slow. A February 2024 scorecard from GridLab handed PJM a grade of D-minus, worst of the seven grid operators studied. Tuesday’s study indicated that PJM has had 64 energy projects, which together account for 5 gigawatts of production, in its queue since 2020 or earlier. PJM’s board has estimated that the region could face capacity shortages as soon as the 2026-2027 delivery year.
The report comes as Maryland customers are bracing for increases as high  as $18 a month in their residential electric bills this summer, depending on their utility, according to another Synapse study, this time commissioned by the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel. The increases are the result of a record-breaking electricity auction last summer by PJM, that set prices for power beginning June 1, 2025.
Maryland lawmakers, spurred by complaints of already rising utility bills, approved sweeping energy reform legislation in the just-ended General Assembly session, which included redirecting an energy efficiency fund into refunds for Maryland ratepayers in fiscal 2026. Those refunds are expected to average about $80 per household.
The main goal of the legislation, which is awaiting Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) signature, was to expedite state-level approvals for new power facilities, for everything from nuclear and solar to natural gas and battery storage. Even then, however, Maryland is still beholden to PJM, which must assess every utility-scale energy project before it can come onto the grid, determining whether transmission upgrades are needed to accommodate new projects, from solar arrays to wind turbines and battery storage.
Maryland Energy Secretary Paul Pinsky said during a virtual news conference Tuesday that PJM is “one of the largest obstacles,” to achieving Maryland’s clean-energy goals and lower customer bills.
“For too long, PJM has caved to the interests of fossil fuel generators and utilities that profit from high electricity prices and scarce new generation,” Pinsky said. “That’s, in my opinion, why PJM has slow-walked reforms that would lower prices.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Pinsky said he does not believe Maryland should leave PJM, but called on the member states to pressure the grid operator to speed up interconnection.
In a statement, PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields said the grid operator began “significant interconnection process reform in July 2023” that has already trimmed the backlog, with additional approvals coming soon.
“In 15 months, PJM relieved the interconnection backlog by 60% and placed more than 6 [gigawatts] of new generation into service,” Shields wrote.
Shields added that the “significantly higher prices in PJM’s last capacity auction confirmed concerns that we had been calling out over the past two years — that the supply/demand balance has been tightening.”
PJM’s reforms included streamlining “Surplus Interconnection Service,” allowing new energy projects to come online at points where the facility does not run continuously — battery storage beside a renewable energy project, for example. PJM also got approval to start a “Reliability Resource Initiative,” fast-tracking up to 50 “shovel-ready” projects.
But critics, including Pinsky, argue that the criteria for the initiative favor natural gas, rather than renewable energy projects.
“PJM promotes their Reliability Resource Initiative, which fast-tracked projects like gas plants. Many projects in the queue are solar paired with storage. Why aren’t these fast-tracked?” Pinsky asked.
Tuesday’s study called on PJM to embrace additional reforms, including a requirement from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that grid operators complete new-project reviews in 150 days. PJM pushed back against that requirement in a filing with the FERC. The study also said PJM needs to update its understanding of battery storage from its current outsated assumption that “energy storage will charge during peak and require associated transmission upgrades.”
The Evergreen report’s best-case modeling included some items that PJM said it is already pursuing, such as a “first-ready, first-served” process that prioritizes approval for projects that could be operational sooner, as well as a clustered approach, where projects can be considered as a group, rather than one-by-one.
The study predicts that carbon dioxide emissions would fall 14% if PJM completes the reforms, which it assumes would lead to an increase in renewable energy generation — even though it concedes that the reforms could lead to approval of new gas-fired power plants.
Lawmakers approve energy reform bills aimed at cutting rates, boosting in-state generation

“We are not hiding those results, even though we think that better options are available for people and the climate — and for ratepayers,” Harper said.
The biggest beneficiary of the reforms would be battery storage, which the report’s computer model predicted would increase by 59 gigawatts compared to the status quo scenario. But new gas combined-cycle units came in second with 25 gigawatts, and onshore wind took third place with 8 gigawatts.
After a recent appeal led by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), and backed by Moore, PJM has pledged to lower the cap set for the next two annual auctions, thereby lowering rates for customers.
PJM has also made a change regarding Maryland coal plants.
Talen Energy had planned to close two Maryland coal-fired plants, Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, but PJM required them to keep running to meet electricity demand, under arrangement, known as a “reliability must run” agreement. Those plants will continue operating past their June 1, 2025, closure dates, with Baltimore Gas & Electric ratepayers footing the bill.
But the energy to be provided by the two plants was not accounted for in PJM’s record-breaking energy auction last summer, raising prices further. In effect, BGE customers are paying for Brandon Shores and Wagner twice: once because of the auction and again because they will pay the plants to run.
After pushback surrounding the auction, PJM said it will include RMR agreements in future auction calculatiohs. Had Brandon Shores and Wagner been included, BGE customers would see a $5.50 per month increase starting in June — rather than a $16 monthly increase, on average.
In a filing Monday, the Office of People’s Counsel asked FERC to give BGE ratepayers a reprieve — or give them a refund if a ruling comes after June.
“PJM ran a flawed auction resulting in prices that—unless corrected—will cost Maryland residential electric customers hundreds of dollars per year in unreasonable and unnecessary capacity costs,” Maryland People’s Counsel David S. Lapp said in a statement. “We are asking FERC to undo those unjust results.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/4277383-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 05:59:13.397100

It’s been almost six months since state Supreme Court candidate Jefferson Griffin narrowly lost last year’s election to incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. Two recounts confirmed the result.


Unfortunately, Griffin’s effort to overturn the election based on the farfetched theory that thousands of registered voters should have their ballots thrown out continues.


And last week, four Republican state Supreme Court justices endorsed the scheme — ruling that the votes of numerous military and overseas voters will be trashed unless they can somehow provide a photo ID in short order. This despite the fact that state rules required no such thing at the time of the election.
It’s a remarkably dangerous ruling that Republican Justice Richard Dietz blasted as an invitation to losing candidates of all kinds to engage in post-election meddling.


The bottom line: If there’s any fairness left in the world, Justice Riggs will prevail in her appeal to the federal courts. But even if she does, the damage done to the legitimacy of our judiciary and our democracy by the Supreme Court ruling will be immense and long-lasting.

Photo by Dr. Gwendolyn Unzicker.OTTAWA COUNTY — After a yearlong legal battle with a far-right county commission, Ottawa County’s administrative health officer has been recognized with a statewide award for her dedication to defending the role.
Adeline Hambley was awarded the 2025 Jean Chabut Health Policy Champion award in Lansing on April 9 from the Michigan Public Health Week Partnership as part of Public Health Week in Michigan.
The award recognizes individuals or organizations for significant contributions to the health and well-being of Michigan citizens in the policy arena at local and/or state levels that strengthens public health.
“I didn’t know anything about it, so they told me that I was awarded it. That was pretty cool,” Hambley said.
The award comes after Hambley successfully fought off attempts by the county’s former far-right majority, known as Ottawa Impact, to remove her from her position.
In January 2023, the far-right Ottawa Impact controlling majority on the board of commissioners attempted to demote, then fire Hambley in favor of a candidate who had no prior experience in public health.
Hambley sued the board and the county in February 2023, claiming the board overstepped its legal authority and that health officers had certain inalienable rights afforded under state law. What followed was two years of unprecedented strain between the board and the county’s health department.
In April 2023, a circuit court judge granted Hambley a preliminary injunction, allowing her to remain in her role until a trial could take place. However, the Michigan Court of Appeals partially vacated that injunction, saying the board had the legal right to fire Hambley as long as state law was followed.
Throughout summer 2023, the board, then-administrator John Gibbs and Hambley battled over a proposed budget for the department. In the end, the OI majority voted to cut $4 million from the health department’s budget and left its rainy day funded nearly depleted.
The board then held a termination hearing in October 2023, which led to an infamous Nov. 6 meeting where the board voted 7-3 to settle with Hambley for $4 million in exchange for her resignation — although OI commissioners soon attempted to walk back the agreement, claiming a deal hadn’t been reached.
In January 2024, a Muskegon County judge found that, although an agreement was discussed, the board’s vote wasn’t clearly worded enough to be legally binding.
Ultimately, the parties settled in February 2024, with Hambley remaining in her role and the county paying her legal fees.
Hambley said she is grateful for the support she received over the past two years.
“The community as a whole has been really supportive, and that has been great … because I can’t imagine doing this for this length of time — people that were constantly outside picketing and sending death threats and hating you,” she said. “I mean, I still would have done it, but certainly having the community backing makes it and the support of staff makes it so much better. So it was nice to see it on a statewide level.”
She said she wants people to look at her story as one of inspiration
“If nothing else, I think it helps to maybe set the tone for other health officers in the state that our positions are important, they are legally protected, and that they should stand up and protect the role and their community. So I’m hopeful that perhaps others will see that importance,” she said.
She said it’s unfortunate that public health has become a political football in the context of the current political climate.
“Some people say it’s lawfare, or it’s politics, and it’s, like, ‘No, man. I didn’t make public health political. Just because they’re using it as a political tool doesn’t mean my defending the laws that govern the work makes it political in nature,’” she said. “It’s really frustrating. But they’re never gonna feel differently, so, oh well.”

Hambley said public health can be taken for granted when it’s working successfully, which has led to a scenario where everyday citizens might not realize all the benefits and advancements that have resulted from its various services and programs.
“I feel like the success of public health has made people blind to the importance of public health to the community,” she said. “We don’t want to go back to the days of people dying of dysentery and typhoid and tetanus.”
Hambley said conversations at the Lansing conference included health officers asking what they can do to help get the word out on why public health is so critical to healthy communities.
“And I spoke up and said that I think that it is being champions of public health in your community. We are the closest to the community where the boots are on the ground — we are the community; we live here,” she said. “That’s why we have those legal protections in place — so we can make, sometimes, those uncomfortable decisions to protect everybody, including the most vulnerable.”
“And that’s how you’re going to have people even know what we do, what public health is … by being that person that stands up. Also, it gets buy-in for what we do, and people see value in it, rather than rely on the rhetoric of lazy bureaucrats.”
Hambley said showing up and standing tall sometimes includes making unpopular decisions, particularly when it comes to infectious disease mitigation, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Really reinforcing that public servant aspect — we are here to serve the community, but that may not please everybody, because it’s to protect the most vulnerable as well, but you have to stand in that space,” she said. “You have to be willing to be uncomfortable and there’s going to be members in the community you’re never going to win over, but there’s going to be a whole lot that see that for what it is.”
The Jean Chabut Health Policy Champion award recognizes individuals or organizations that have made significant contributions in the policy arena to strengthen public health. In 2015, this award was renamed in memory of Jean Chabut, who served as deputy director of Public Health at the Michigan Department of Community Health from 2003 to 2012. From her beginnings as a public health nurse in Detroit, through her transition to public health administrator, until her death in 2014, Chabut was a tireless advocate who fought for improved health for Michigan’s most vulnerable citizens.
Prior to becoming the department’s chief executive, Hambley served as environmental health manager from 2011 to 2022. She has held various local, state and national leadership positions. She holds a master of business administration degree and a bachelor of science degree from Grand Valley State University.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Gov. Kelly Armstrong signed two bills last week that will change laws surrounding political communications and advertisements in North Dakota.
House Bill 1167, sponsored by Rep. Jonathan Warrey, R-Casselton, would require a disclaimer in capital letters on any political communication or political advertisement created wholly or in part by artificial intelligence tools.
The bill would include advertisements and communications involving political candidates, political committees, political parties and initiated ballot committees or petitions.
“With capital letters, (House Bill) 1167 is a step forward in setting perimeters for the use of AI within political communications,” said Rep. Austen Schauer, R-West Fargo. 
The House unanimously passed the bill in February. The Senate unanimously passed the bill in March.
Another bill signed by Armstrong, House Bill 1204, expands state law against publishing knowingly false political advertisements.
If a person “knowingly, or with reckless disregard for its truth” publishes an “untrue, deceptive or misleading” political advertisement or news release, they could be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, according to the bill.

The bill expands the types of media covered under the law to include text messages, phone calls and social media posts, in addition to radio, television, newspapers, pamphlets and billboards, among others.
The bill was amended on the floor of the Senate by Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, former campaign manager for North Dakota U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak.
On the day of the 2024 primary election, anonymous text messages were sent to North Dakota voters saying Fedorchak had dropped out of the race, which she did not. 
“Knowingly spreading falsehoods about an opponent undermines the integrity of our elections,” Cleary said.
On the House floor, Rep. Colette Brown, D-Warwick, said, in today’s political climate, misinformation can spread faster than ever before.
“Whether on social media, television or traditional campaign materials, this bill ensures that when someone deliberately publishes falsehoods about a candidate, a ballot measure, or any election-related issue, they can be held responsible,” Brown said.
The bill passed the House unanimously in February and the Senate on a 45-1 vote in March.
The new laws will take effect Aug. 1.

(Getty Images)To Nancy Biederman, proper teaching is about staying on the right side of the line. On one side are the topics and behavior appropriate for students; on the other, subject material that is overly personal, political, social, or religious. 
Teachers should remain on the first side, Biederman believes. The second should be the sole domain of a student’s parents. And lawmakers should establish legislative safeguards to make sure the line is respected. 
“Teachers are just stepping over the line and trying to become the parents of the children,” said Biederman, a New Boston resident and former elementary and middle school teacher, in an interview. “And that’s not their job.” 
That sentiment has driven a raft of school-related Republican legislation, such as the parental bill of rights, which passed the House, 212-161, in March. It’s also inspired a less prominent bill.
House Bill 235 would update the state’s educator code of conduct to require that teachers pledge a responsibility to parents — not just students. Teachers found by the State Board of Education to have failed that responsibility could face disciplinary sanctions. 
Some, like Biederman, a strong advocate for the parental bill of rights, have cheered HB 235. “I think it would definitely make teachers stop and think for a second before they discuss certain topics,” said Biederman. “And I think it would put that line in the sand that seems to have disappeared, of where they are allowed to discuss and give opinions … on certain topics.” 
But the move has drawn fierce criticism from teachers, who say they already do maintain productive relationships with parents but that legislating those relationships would constrain their ability to do their job.
“I just think you could be abused,” said Mary Ann Cadwallader, a Hanover resident and former teacher, in an interview Tuesday. 
Under current law, the educator code of conduct requires that teachers and other educators maintain four responsibilities: to the education profession and educational professionals; to students; to the school community; and to the “responsible and ethical use of technology as it relates to students, schools, and other educational professionals.”
HB 235 would simply add the phrase “and parents” to educators’ responsibility to students. Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and the chairman of the House Education Funding Committee, said it would solidify what should already be part of a teacher’s job.
“Parents are involved in your schools,” Ladd, a former school administrator, said. “… It’s important that we recognize, and I think by recognize in this code of ethics that parents or guardians need to be there.”
The legislation comes as increasing parental involvement in schools has been a top priority for conservatives, amid accusations that teachers are usurping the role of families. House Bill 10, the parental bill of rights, would enumerate a number of rights of parents with respect to their school districts, including the right to direct their child’s education or care, make health care decisions for their child, review school records, consent to any medical tests, and consent to any video recordings of their child. It would also obligate teachers and administrators to communicate and review curriculum with parents, 
HB 235 is a much simpler bill. But teachers’ unions have warned it could still have a broad and negative impact in the classroom.
“There’s a lot put on educators when it comes to all sorts of rules, regulations that you need to follow,” said Brian Hawkins, director of government relations for the National Education Association of New Hampshire, at a hearing on the bill in the House Education Policy and Administration Committee. “And they just want to go in there and teach and educate.” 
Hawkins added there is “no doubt” that partnerships between parents and teachers are important. But he said that complex issues and demands from parents are often better handled by school administrators, not individual teachers.
If passed by the Senate and signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte, it is not yet clear how HB 235 would be implemented. The bill itself is short; the exact requirements put into the educator code of conduct would be fleshed out by the State Board of Education and the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules after the bill’s passage. Hawkins warned lawmakers that because the term “responsibility” is not defined, the bill could give broad leeway to JLCAR to add expansive requirements for teachers. 
In written testimony to the House committees, other teachers expressed opposition to the idea of having a formal statutory responsibility to teachers. 
Some said it would be too high a time burden. Others said the bill would eliminate the potential for schools to act as a safe space for children who are struggling internally. 
“I am a professional who treats all of my students with respect,” said Heather Fabbri, of Hampton Falls, who identified herself as a 29-year teacher. “I fear this bill will open doors to parents who have an agenda about who does and does not deserve to feel safe within my classroom.”
Cadwallader hasn’t been teaching since 2001. But she says when she was a teacher, any issues with parents were dealt with head on, without the need for legislative mandates. 
“Public education is very important for everyone and parents certainly have a role in that,” she said. “There’s teacher conferences for parents to talk. A parent who’s really upset with what’s happening can go and talk to the principal in the school.”
To Cadwallader, the current climate can feel oppressive for teachers. 
“I don’t think the general motivation to be a teacher is to stay out of the reach of the law for Pete’s sake. It’s to attend to a child. It’s to be the best teacher you can be, which means you have to get your coursework across to the student.”
But Biederman says teachers can avoid that scrutiny as long as they stay in their professional lane, as she says she and her colleagues did before she retired from the profession 10 years ago. 
“A teacher needs to respect a parent’s right to bring their child up the way they want to bring their child up,” she said. “And how dare you step over that line. As long as the child has their basic needs met, there is no reason for a teacher” to get involved.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/classroomparents-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-16 05:59:13.397100

The attorneys general […[...],"(Stock photo Mint Images/Getty Images)Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost on Monday joined the vast majority of state attorneys general in demanding that Congress make a major change in the business of selling drugs. 
They want to prohibit giant health conglomerates from owning both powerful middlemen and pharmacies that compete with the other pharmacies the middlemen serve. The attorneys general say it’s a setup that gives an unfair advantage to the conglomerates, some of which are among the largest companies in the United States.
In a letter to congressional leaders, they said rapid consolidation and “vertical integration” have raised prices, limited competition, and shut off pharmacy access — especially for the most underserved populations.
In Ohio, the once-obscure middlemen — known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs — have been the subject of controversy for more than seven years. When he was still state auditor, Yost investigated their dealings with state agencies, and since he became AG in 2019, he has sued several.
PBMs represent insurers in drug transactions by creating pharmacy networks, reconciling claims, extracting rebates and fees from drugmakers, and monitoring drug utilization. They say they create savings for insurers and consumers, but the bipartisan attorneys general said that’s not the case.
“PBMs were supposed to help consumers access low-cost pharmaceutical care through negotiated volume-pricing discounts, generic substitution, manufacturer rebates, and other tools,” it says. “While the promise of PBMs was to lower healthcare costs, the reality has been the opposite: Healthcare costs in the United States have skyrocketed. PBMs are using manufacturer rebates to increase, rather than decrease, drug prices. Healthcare costs are higher in the United States than any other developed country in the world, but healthcare outcomes in the United States are not equally extraordinary.”
That last assertion is a big understatement. The Commonwealth Fund last year compared health outcomes in the United States to those in nine other developed countries. Our system is by far the most expensive, yet the outcomes it produced ranked dead last.
A spokesman for CVS Health, one of the conglomerates that owns a big-three PBM, said the attorneys general were just trying to help the big drugmakers with their letter. 
“Earlier this week, 38 attorneys general intentionally chose Big Pharma over people by asking the government for more ways to help drug companies make more money,” the spokesman, Phillip Blando, said in an email.
Spokespeople for the other two conglomerates — UnitedHealth Group and Cigna-Express Scripts — didn’t immediately respond to questions for this story.
Blando said that “CVS Caremark does not set the price of drugs, and rebates do not increase the cost of drugs.” However, academic research and the Federal Trade Commission have both concluded that rising manufacturer rebates to PBMs has resulted in higher costs to consumers.
In their letter, nearly four-fifths of state attorneys general said all three companies are a part of why health care functions so poorly in the United States.
“Over the past few decades, horizontal consolidation and vertical integration have transformed PBMs from useful administrative service providers into market-dominating behemoths that control the industry,” it said. “The three largest PBMs process 80% of the nation’s prescriptions and bring in 70% of the (high-cost) specialty drug revenue. Furthermore, these same PBMs, along with the next-largest three, are vertically integrated both upstream and down.”
That means they own upstream companies such as major insurers that employ them, and doctors’ practices that write prescriptions. And they own downstream companies like the retail and mail-order pharmacies they reimburse for drugs.

The attorneys general said there are inherent conflicts in the arrangements. 
“Each of the top six PBMs (which control 94% of the marketplace) operate their own affiliated pharmacies, while five of the top six are also a part of parent conglomerates that operate insurance companies and health care clinics,” the letter said. “Even now, PBMs continue to devour more of the pharmaceutical industry: three of the top PBMs have recently opened their own manufacturing subsidiaries or entered into ‘co-manufacturing’ agreements with existing manufacturers. This vertical integration allows PBMs and their parent companies to control every step of the prescription manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and dispensing process.”
Because the six biggest PBMs control access to almost all the insured patients in the United States, independent pharmacists and small chains say they have little choice but to accept whatever terms they’re offered to join their networks. Many of those opaque deals include low reimbursements, arbitrary rules and big clawbacks, many have said.
Because contract terms aren’t public — and because PBMs are allowed to own pharmacies — they’re unfairly squeezing their competitors, the attorneys general said.
“This creates the situation where the PBMs — through ownership of affiliated pharmacies — are contracting with and have power over their own pharmacies’ competition,” their letter said. “The PBMs then use their place as middlemen to exert this power in ways that harm independent pharmacies, forcing these small businesses to accept contractual terms that are ‘confusing, unfair, arbitrary, and harmful.'” 
The arrangement creates incentives for PBMs to give their own pharmacies “more favorable contract terms, steer consumers away from independent pharmacies to their own affiliated pharmacies, and otherwise engage in tactics aimed at forcing their competition out of business,” the letter said. “Over the course of the last decade, approximately ten percent of rural independent pharmacies in the United States have closed.”
Blando of CVS said that his company’s PBM’s only goal is to lower costs.
“CVS Caremark represents the only part of the health care industry whose sole aim is to lower costs. Across the country, CVS Pharmacies are the main point of contact for people to get their medicines,” he said. “Together, we work to make medicine more affordable, improve patient care, and deliver better outcomes.”
It wasn’t immediately clear Tuesday how the AGs’ demand would be received by Congress. But several parts of the federal government have shown greater interest in regulating the PBM industry.
Late last year, then President-elect Donald Trump publicly criticized the middlemen. Sweeping reforms were built into a bipartisan deal to keep the government open. 
The reforms were estimated to save the government $1 billion over 10 years. But then billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy tanked the deal by claiming it spent too much. Despite their expected savings, the PBM reforms didn’t make their way into the massive spending plan that passed with Trump’s backing.
Yost is advocating for similar measures in the current Congress.
The Federal Trade Commission has also undertaken a major investigation of the PBM industry, and is suing it over its practices regarding insulin. But the federal antitrust watchdog now is in turmoil as Trump tries to remove the two Democratic-appointed commissioners in disregard of what the 1914 law creating the agency says.
For his part, CVS’s Blando said the if successful, the state AGs will only make American health care more expensive and less effective.
“Hindering our work would make health care more challenging and less affordable, exactly the opposite of what American consumers want,” he said.

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
Black colleges ponder their future as Trump makes cuts to education dollars

The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Tribes, Native students sue feds over education cuts

Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.











There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher



Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)The Baltimore region could get a new trash wheel, one of 21 environmental projects for which Baltimore City is providing funding to compensate for pollution caused by the failure of two city wastewater treatment plants during the pandemic.
The projects, announced Tuesday, will be funded by $1.7 million from the city under a consent decree with the Maryland Department of the Environment. The decree also required millions of dollars in repairs and other improvements to the treatment plants, $1.4 million in penalties and the potential for another $1.4 million of improvement efforts fall short.
The Chesapeake Bay Trust will distribute funding for the projects, which include tree plantings, rain gardens, waterway sampling, trail stabilization and educational efforts around the Baltimore region.
“These projects, they’re going to provide real benefits to those communities that have really faced pollution for way too long,” said Maryland Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain during an event Tuesday at Cox’s Point Park, across from the Back River plant. “But they’re not just going to address the damages of the past. They’re actually going to create new opportunities for those communities.”

Baltimore City’s two wastewater treatment plants — the Back River plant in Dundalk and one on the Patapsco River in Wagner’s Point — are the largest in Maryland. And as the COVID-19 pandemic raged, they descended into disrepair.
Advocates at the nonprofit Blue Water Baltimore first flagged high bacteria levels in the Patapsco in 2021, tipping off state environmental inspectors who uncovered mechanical failures and staffing woes that led to overages of pollutants such as bacteria and nutrients, which cause algae blooms that harm marine life.
Months later, with the Back River plant — the larger of the two — on the verge of “catastrophic failure,” then-Environment Secretary Ben Grumbles invoked a rarely used provision in state law to send a team of Maryland Environmental Service experts in to oversee operations at the plant. MDE then filed suit against the city, as did Blue Water Baltimore.
By about June 2022, Back River plant discharges began to meet pollution limits, and the Patapsco plant followed behind. The city paid MES some $7 million for its assistance.
“These plants, as we all know, have faced some real challenges over the past years,” McIlwain said. “But how you respond to those challenges is really what matters. And I am so happy to say today that the city of Baltimore responded. The Maryland Environmental Service responded.”
While the consent decree included the threat of another $1.4 million in penalties if the city failed to comply, the city is “on track” not to owe the extra funds, MDE spokesman Jay Apperson said in a statement Tuesday.
As of its most recent report, in February, the city has spent $167 million on repairs at Back River and another $92 million at Patapsco. The city has also disbursed some $40 million to hire private contractors to augment city staff at the facilities.
The plants are generally compliant with their daily, weekly and monthly pollution discharge limits, but exceedances and spills have led to about $72,000 in additional fines against the city since the consent decree took effect.
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D), who turned 41 last week, said Tuesday that the two sewage plants “haven’t had the investment that they needed in my lifetime.” The Back River plant opened in 1911 and the Patapsco plant in 1940.
“We know where we were just a few short years ago, and you can see that we’ve taken leaps and bounds since then,” Scott said. “But this is not us celebrating. This is us acknowledging the great progress that’s been made, and also acknowledging that we have a lot more work to do.”

Community groups who remember when overages at the Back River plant closed the river to swimming just a few years ago remain wary, especially when odors waft around Dundalk and Essex. But Tuesday was still an exciting day, said Desiree Greaver, a project manager at the nonprofit Back River Restoration Committee, which will install the new trash wheel.
“It’s like Christmas,” Greaver said. “This is huge for Back River. It’s going to be so impactful, and the community is really excited.”
Just about every day, the committee sends volunteers to a trash-collecting boom just upstream of the wastewater treatment plant, who don waders and manually remove trash and debris. Once, they caught a hot tub. Another time, port-a-potties.
Even with $655,363 coming from Tuesday’s consent decree, the committee still needs to raise several hundred thousand dollars to make the project a reality, Greaver said. But the nonprofit is optimistic that the project will come to fruition, possibly within 18 months. And once it does, it will make life a lot easier for trash-cleaning volunteers.
“We actually have people getting in the water, physically removing the trash, and we can’t rely on that forever,” Greaver said. “It’s not a glamorous job. It’s not something that’s easy to find help for. So we were really looking forward to something that was automated.”
The new trash wheel will join four others along Baltimore shorelines, best known for their large googly eyes and varying personas.
About $44,000 of the grant money will also go toward a mentoring program administered by One More … One Less, focused on connecting individuals with mental health challenges to water recreation, said Brian Bordley, the group’s CEO.
During Tuesday’s event, Bordley spoke about his own memories fishing with his father near Cox’s Point Park, gaining valuable life experience — even when they didn’t catch anything. By starting his own mentoring program, he hoped to share those same experiences with local kids.
“We gave access to these kids to be on the water, and we saw things change in their behavior,” Bordley said. “Their attitudes became adjusted. Their behavior started to become less hostile and angry. We found that they had a mental health byproduct of just being out on the water.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Serena-McIlwain-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 05:01:22.469087

Russell Jr., center, with Larry S. Gibson, left, and William H. ""Billy"" Murphy Jr. (Photo courtesy of University of Maryland, Baltimore)George L. Russell Jr., a pioneer in the Black legal community who became the first Black to sit on an appellate court in Maryland, first Black city solicitor and first Black president of the Baltimore City Bar Association, died Saturday at the age of 96.
“He was a giant. He was a pioneer. He was somebody who paved the way for so many Black attorneys in this state,” said Del. Malcolm Ruff (D-Baltimore City), an attorney at the firm Murphy, Flacon & Murphy in Baltimore. “But for George Russell, I wouldn’t have the opportunity that I have today. There wouldn’t be this pathway for the legal practice for Black attorneys.”
Russell’s friends and colleagues said he often supported other Black attorneys.
Larry S. Gibson, a longtime friend and member of the same Black fraternity as Russell, Kappa Alpha Psi, said Russell joined other Black attorneys every Saturday morning “to just shoot the breeze” at Brown, Allen, Watts and Murphy, one of the first Black law firms in Baltimore and the first in the city’s downtown. Russell later became a partner in the firm.
“Those Saturday morning bull sessions really became familiar with George Russell. It began a change in my life,” said Gibson, who graduated with a law degree from Columbia University and was admitted to the bar in 1967. He then began to work for the firm in Baltimore.
One conversation Gibson recalled with Russell was about work ethic.
“George would go to bed between 7:30 to 8 o’clock [p.m.],” he said. “I remember George telling me, ‘You want to impress a client? Call them at 6:30 a.m. and tell them you’re working on their case.’”

Gibson said one of Russell’s major achievements dealt with influencing the community.
In 1982, Russell established Harbor Bank, one of the largest minority-owned banks in the nation. Gibson said Russell also had a major influence on the construction of the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture in downtown Baltimore.
He said Russell pushed for Black architects to design the museum. One was Gary Bowden, who taught architecture at the University of Maryland, College Park. The museum will hold iits 20th anniversary gala next month.
“George was determined it was going to be built downtown from the ground up,” said Gibson, who is retiring this month after 50 years of teaching at the University of Maryland Francis Carey School of Law.
Russell was born March 19, 1929. According to The HistoryMakers, a nonprofit research and education institution, Russell’s mother was a homemaker and his father a postal worker.
He graduated from Frederick Douglass High School in 1946, then received a degree in economics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1950 and a law degree at the University of Maryland in 1954.
He was drafted into the Army the same year, working in legal and and in charge of courts, boards and special courts martial.
Russell left his law firm in 1966 after being appointed to become the first African American to serve as associate judge of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore and first to sit on an appellate court in Maryland. A few other firsts included the first Black city solicitor for Baltimore City (1968 to 1974), and the first Black candidate to run for mayor in 1971. He came in second place in the Democratic primary behind eventually winner, William Donald Schaefer.
After city solicitor, Russell returned to private practice in the mid 1970s and became a partner at Russell & Thompson through 1986. During that year, Russell merged his Black firm with a predominantly white firm, Piper and Marbury, one of the top 100 firms in the country.
According to the Maryland archives, Russell became associated with the law offices of the late Peter G. Angelos, the former majority owner of the Baltimore Orioles.
Russell received numerous legal and community awards and served on statewide boards such as the Maryland Museum of African American History and Culture Commission, as chair of the Governor’s Salary Commission and chair of Baltimore’s Judicial Nominating Commission.
“I’m sorry to hear of the passing of Judge George Russell Jr.,” Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), chair of the House Judiciary Committee and assistant state’s attorney in Anne Arundel County, said in a text message Tuesday. “He was a trailblazing jurist, attorney and public servant who made the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland better for all its residents while opening doors to African Americans that were closed for too long.”
Russell is survived by his son, George L. Russell III, who became chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Maryland in May 2024.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Larry-Gibons-George-L.-Russell-Jr.-and-William-H.-Billy-Murphy-Jr-1024x664.jpg,,,2025-04-16 05:01:22.469087

But advocates in Ohio are still preparing their arguments to boost state support as the budget process rolls on.
The Ohio Senate is working toward a draft budget after the House approved its version earlier this month.
As the process continues toward its July 1 deadline, child care advocates hope to get some things into the Senate budget that didn’t appear in the House version. They say they’re important not only for families in need of child care, but also for the state economy and the workforce that supports it.
The House proposal included $200 million for the Child Care Choice Voucher Program over the next two years. The funding comes from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant.
Also included in the House proposal is the establishment of the Child Care Cred Program. It’s a provision originally introduced as Republican-led legislation to split the costs of child care three ways — between the state, the business and the employee — when an eligible individual is employed by a business willing to apply for the program.
Parents and workers involved with child care space met with advocacy group Groundwork Ohio on Tuesday to discuss the current level of child care support. They also discussed how additional state spending would increase child care affordability and access, and boost the wages of child care workers.
Cheryl Rose said when she was a young parent working in food service, child care assistance based on her income helped her remain in the workforce and grow professionally.
Now a partner at Constellation Wealth Advisors, Rose said workforce growth is the one thing that will drive prosperity, and workforce growth is possible through support for child care. That support creates longterm ripple effects that may not appear instantly, but will impact the state’s financial future for years to come, she said.
“What happens is, 18 years from now, there are companies (growing because of an increase in workers), there are more opportunities,” Rose said. “It creates multitudes.”

Improving the lives of child care workers has its own ripple effects, said Christian Davis, founder of the Cincinnati Parent Empowerment Network. With historically low pay, child care workers are often on public assistance and can’t afford food, let alone care for their own children. Bringing wages up and giving workers the ability to thrive boosts the care they can give, she said.
“The quality of your center is really a determinant of the quality of the staff to fill those needs,” Davis said.
Groundwork Ohio wants to see the Child Care Voucher Program receive more funding to address affordability, and the group, among others, will to push for an increase to the eligibility level for the state’s Publicly Funded Child Care.
Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive proposal raised eligibility for care to 160% of the federal poverty line. For a family of four in Ohio, that’s $51,440. But the House left eligibility at 145% in its version of the budget, a level that the head of the Ohio Department of Children and Youth say is the lowest level of support in the country.
The budget also comes at a time when 4 in 10 Ohioans don’t have access because of a lack of child care facilities in their area, according to new analysis by Groundwork Ohio.
The survey also found that, on average, a mom working full-time spends 27% of her median earnings on child care for an infant. It’s worse for moms who are primary earners. Just 32% of Ohio households are headed by women, but they make up 59% of those in poverty, the study found.
The average cost for an infant to be in child care in Ohio is more than $12,000 per year, according to Child Care Aware of America.
Government support of child care enjoys significant public approval. New polling released by the First Five Years Fund, found “strong support” among Republican voters for child care-related tax credits at the federal level.
The recent polling found that 75% of Republicans think the inability to access or afford child care as a “crisis” or a “major problem” for American working families. A majority said expanding child care tax credits would “strengthen the overall economy.”
Of those Republican voters, 83% support increasing the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. It might be on the chopping block as congressional Republicans decide what to include in a funding blueprint approved earlier this month.
The Trump administration is also considering a proposal to eliminate funding for Head Start, a child care program for low-income households.
Head Start is among the programs child care advocates have said should be supported further to improve education outcomes and child care opportunities, rather than be cut.

(Charles Rex Arbogast/The Associated Press)Lawmakers on the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee voted to advance a bill that would modify the law born out of a 2021 referendum question requiring the Maine Legislature to approve any new high-impact transmission lines.
The committee voted 7-4, along party lines of those present, to recommend the passage of LD 810 with some small changes. 
The legislation is meant to clarify that when the Legislature asks for a new line to be developed, that line should not come back to the Legislature for approval after the review process performed by the Public Utilities Commission.
Democrats who were present for the vote supported the bill from Rep. Chris Kessler (D-South Portland), while Republicans voiced concerns about repealing the rule.
“This is appropriate and good public policy to ensure that we are having at least a lower cost of building transmission in the state and ultimately with the goal of reducing costs for ratepayers but not abdicating our responsibility for a thorough review of these projects,” Kessler said, noting that current statute could lead to developers sinking millions of dollars into a project that could ultimately be voted down by lawmakers. 
‘Not good public policy’: Bill would roll back some provisions of 2021 transmission line referendum

In 2021, Maine voters approved a ballot question to increase legislative oversight on new transmission lines in a campaign that drew passionate grassroots support and over $60 million in opposition spending fueled mostly by international energy companies.
The question was largely seen as a vehicle to stop the controversial 145-mile transmission line through western Maine known as New England Clean Energy Connect. Despite the political and legal hurdles, Central Maine Power’s corridor project is expected to be completed later this year. 
Having worked closely on the 2021 referendum, Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock) said the intention was to give the public a way to debate the merits of a line being proposed by an entity other than the Legislature. Given that, she feels LD 810 provides a “really helpful clarification of the intent of the referendum.”
She went on to say that this is an “opportunity to make it crystal clear that a line that’s authorized by the Legislature is different than a line that’s being proposed by a for-profit entity.”
Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) said he isn’t comfortable repealing it because, as it stands, the rule allows those who live in the path of these projects and could face eminent domain takings to appear before the Legislature, rather than receive notification by mail.
“It gives us one more chance to debate, discuss and either approve or not said line,” Foster said.
Before casting a vote against, Sen. Matt Harrington (R-York) said he was “highly conflicted” about the bill. While he believes businesses that want to invest large sums of money in Maine should not have to come before “this highly emotional group of people we call the Maine Legislature anymore than possible,” he acknowledged that more often, the general public doesn’t have concerns about such projects until after the route is determined, which normally comes after preemptive legislative approval. 
Before the committee voted, Kessler proposed amending the bill to insert the word “statutory” to clarify that transmission lines proposed by agencies with the statutory authority to do so will be deemed to have the necessary legislative approval. 
The legislative analyst said she could come back to the committee with further language suggestions to better define when an agency has that sort of authority.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Virtually all of the articles that I have written for Kansas Reflector and for other publications have been about agriculture.
That is a byproduct of this Kansas farm boy’s upbringing. The land, and the people who tend to it, are topics close to my heart. That said, these are troubling times, and my heart and mind tell me that this nation, and others, have lost their way. Society is fraying, and at a pace that should be deeply troubling to anyone with a sense of history. That is apparent at the Republican-dominated state legislature in Kansas as well as at the highest levels of the federal government.
Over the past six decades, my career and personal interests have taken me to various corners of the world, and I have dealt with some of the richest of the rich, and the poorest of the poor — from the standpoint of material wealth — during my travels. I have seen some of the worst, and some of the best, of humankind.
I will carry those experiences with me until my dying day.
Experiences give us perspective, and coupled with education, they help us to connect the dots and draw parallels from the past to current events. Civilization is diminished when we ignore the lessons of history and fail to act with respect to people and events that we know are simply not right.
Sometimes an event, or a book, will enable a person to pull together those experiences in a way that is a sort of early warning sign that we have lost our way, in the United States or other parts of the world.
For me, a cathartic moment came from a book that I read recently. It is called Time’s Echo: the Second World War, the Holocaust, and the Music of Remembrance. As the author Jeremy Eichler stated, it is about “the role of music … as a witness to history and as a carrier of memory for a post-Holocaust world.”
He notes that World War II caused “a tear in the fabric of humanity, resulting in deep trauma, grief, and scarring.”  And he reminds us that “music remembers us.”
All of this is pertinent to today’s world, and especially in the United States. Most of us know what is right and what is wrong. But the book notes: “The future will not judge us for forgetting, but for remembering all too well and still not acting in accordance with those memories.” As former President Biden mused in his speech at the Democratic convention — what will our legacy be? What will the children say?
One need not be a historian to know that the path undertaken by the current regime lacks a moral compass. Power corrupts, and those who cannot see the parallels between this regime and those in power in the times leading up to World War II are taking us down a path that will not end well.
It is an inflection point in history.
Those of us who recognize the situation have to decide what we do and where we go from here. May we choose wisely and well, and may our example be remembered by generations to come.

Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic Party nominee for vice president, speaks at the Columbus Convention Center as the keynote speaker for the national Network for Public Education conference on Sunday, April 6, 2025. (Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Hands Off! demonstrations at the Ohio Statehouse that drew thousands of protestors wasn’t the only gathering of activists earlier this month in downtown Columbus. 
Just a short distance away at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, a smaller but equally passionate gathering of concerned citizens from across the nation came to Ohio’s capital city to attend the Network for Public Education’s National Conference and affirm their support for the common school, the very symbol of democracy in this increasingly divided nation.
That disunion is driven in part by the rapid growth of universal educational vouchers and charter schools, where public funds flow to private and religious schools as well as privately operated charter schools and where public accountability and oversight of taxpayer funds is limited or even absent. 
In many states, including Ohio, those public funds in the form of vouchers are drawn from the very state budget line item that is earmarked for public schools.
Of particular concern to the conference attendees is the division in communities fueled by vouchers, which have been shown in some states to subsidize private and religious school tuition exceeding 80% of those enrolled. 
In Ohio, according to research conducted by former Ohio lawmaker Stephen Dyer, the figure is 91%. Several speakers referred to this situation as “welfare for the rich” and “an entitlement for the wealthy.” 
The research shared at the conference also confirmed the findings of the National Coalition for Public Education that “most recipients of private school vouchers in universal programs are wealthy families whose children never attended public schools in the first place.”
So much for the tired Republican rhetoric of vouchers being a lifeline of escape from “failing schools” for poor inner-city children.
Another strong area of concern shared at the NPE event was the growing intrusion of religious organizations like Life Wise Academy which recruit students for release time Bible study during the school day. 
While attendees were told that school guidelines direct that such activities are to be scheduled during electives and lunch, the programs still conflict with the normal school routine and put a burden on school resources, where time is needed for separating release time students and adjusting the instructional routine because of the arrival and departure of a group within the classroom.
One presenter, concerned about students receiving conflicting information, said that his experience as a science teacher found situations where there was a disconnect between what he termed “Biblical stories and objective facts.” 
Some Ohio school districts, including Westerville and Worthington in Franklin County, had to amend their policies in the wake of HB 8, which mandated that districts have religious instruction release time policies in place. The district policies had been written as an attempt to lessen the possibility of other religious programs wanting access to students and the further disruption that would cause to the school routine. 
The recent legislative activity about accommodating religious groups like LifeWise is at variance with history, as conference chair and Network for Public Education founder Dr. Diane Ravitch pointed out in her remarks about the founding of Ohio. 
As part of the Northwest Territory, she noted that Ohio was originally divided into sixteen townships, with Township 16, one square mile of the grid, being reserved for school lands. Unlike education, there was no intent to designate any part of the grid for religious purposes, she explained.
Ohio became the first state to be formed from the Northwest Territory, and its provision for public education would become a prototype for the young republic. The common school, an idea central to the founders of the state, would be located such “that local schools would have an income and that the community schoolhouses would be centrally located for all children.”
Unfortunately, the idea of the common school being centrally located in every community is an idea not centrally located within the minds of right-wing Republican legislators. From the information exchanged at the conference, that is the case in the great majority of statehouses, and a matter of great concern for continuing national cohesiveness.
The theme of the NPE National Conference, “Public Schools – Where All Students Are Welcome,” stands in marked contrast with the exclusionary practices of private and religious schools where, unlike public schools, there are no requirements to accept and enroll every student interested in attending. While these schools are reluctant to accept students who may need additional instructional support, they show no reluctance in accepting state voucher payments.
Texas state Rep. Gina Hinojosa, one of the keynote speakers, told the audience about her experience in fighting Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s voucher scheme and the double meaning of the term school choice. 
“School choice is also the school’s choice,” she told the audience, as she estimated that 80% or more of state funds will go to kids who are already enrolled in private and religious schools.
Her battle with the Texas governor, who has defined the passage of voucher legislation in the Lone Star State as his “urgent priority,” is a tale of his alliance with Jeff Yass, a pro-voucher Pennsylvania billionaire who has donated $12 million so far to Abbott’s voucher crusade. 
Hinojosa was scathing in her criticism of Abbott and his fellow Republicans and of a party that once “worshipped at the altar of accountability.” Now, she told the attendees, “they want free cash money, with no strings attached.” 
“Grift, graft, and greed” is the narrative of appropriating public funds for private purposes, Hinojosa believes, a tale of supporting “free taxpayer money with no accountability.”
The NPE conference ended with an address by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee. 
With his background as a former teacher and coach, Walz had a strong connect with an audience comprised mostly of educators and public school advocates. His folksy language and sense of humor further endeared him to the conference attendees.
Based on the continuing bad behavior of affluent actors in the voucher and charter wars, “greedy bastards” is a better descriptor than oligarchs, he observed. 
From the reaction of the audience and what they heard previously from Gina Hinojosa and other presenters, the language offered by Walz was a more accurate definition of welfare for the wealthy. 
At the end of his remarks, Walz encouraged educators not to despair but to accept their key place in society. “There is a sense that servant leadership comes out of serving in public education.”
Attendees at the NPE conference included educators, school board members, attorneys, legislators, clergy, and policy makers — a cross-section of America. 
Their presence affirmed a core belief that the public school, open to all, represents the very essence of a democratic society. 
And there is no debate about whether or not those schools are under attack by right-wing legislatures intent on rewarding higher-income constituents with tuition support to schools that choose their students as they exercise the “school’s choice.” (As a devotee of the Apostrophe Protection Society, I applaud this distinction.)
So what are we going to do about this? Attendees left the conference with some strong themes.
The choir needs to sing louder.
Hope over fear. Aspiration over despair.
The road to totalitarianism is littered with people who say you’re overreacting.
As the loudness about the subject of what is more aptly described as “the school’s choice” gets louder,” you can bet that servant leaders like Diane Ravitch, Gina Hinojosa, Tim Walz and others are making a difference in responding to the challenge of servant leadership to ensure that the common school, so central to 19th Century communities in the Northwest Territory and beyond, continues to be the choice of every community for defining America and the democracy it represents.

This year, marijuana advocates are playing defense in multiple state legislatures. (Bruce Bennett/Getty Images.)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.










Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug


“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
Pot smell and safety concerns ignite disputes over public smoking

“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
Drug decriminalization stumbled in Oregon. Other states are taking note.

“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
The Colorado psychedelic mushroom experiment has arrived

In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

 Keri Heintzeman,  the director of President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign in Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District and the wife of state Rep. Josh Heintzeman, cruised to an easy victory in Tuesday’s Republican primary for the the Senate District 6 special election.
She’ll face Denise Slipy, who ran unopposed for the Democratic-Farmer-Labor nomination.
Candidates are running to replace former state Sen. Justin Eichorn. The special election is April 29; the district comprises Grand Rapids and the Brainerd Lakes region.
In a statement released after her victory, Heintzeman said, “The upcoming election is critical for restoring fiscal responsibility to our state government and ensuring accountability for the significant waste and fraud under the Walz administration.”
In addition to her political work, Heintzeman is helping homeschool the family’s six children.
Minnesota DFL Chair Richard Carlbom praised Slipy in a statement: “As a reserve officer and former volunteer firefighter, Denise Slipy has dedicated herself to serving her community. Denise will fight to protect her constituents’ health care and be a champion for strong public schools because she knows that public service should be about improving people’s lives, not partisan politics.”
Slipy is an environmental health and safety professional and first responder for North Crow Wing County who calls herself a moderate Democrat. She’ll face long odds against Heintzeman in the heavily Republican district; Crow Wing County voted for President Donald Trump over Kamala Harris by 31 percentage points.
But Democrats have often pulled off surprising special election victories during both of Donald Trump’s presidential terms, boosted by motivated anti-Trump voters and independents who turned against Trump during his first term and appear to be doing so again.
Turnout was modest Tuesday — unofficial returns showed about 7,300 Republicans and 1,200 Democrats cast ballots.
The Reformer profiled the race recently.
Eichorn resigned following his arrest last month on federal charges of attempted coercion and enticement of a minor.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS – Attendees of a Tuesday evening town hall focused on the impact of Trump administration policies voiced worries about federal funding cuts, the impact of tariffs and a lack of communication from elected officials.
The event, the second of four sessions held across South Dakota and led by prominent South Dakota Democrats, took place at Augustana University’s Hamre Recital Hall. 
Nikki Gronli, former U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development director,  said she wanted to organize the sessions to listen to people and offer resources to those who feel ignored by South Dakota’s congressional delegation as they face fallout from federal funding cuts by President Donald Trump’s administration.
“We know that people are concerned, afraid and have seen impacts in their lives already from grants and loans and things that have been paused,” Gronli said.
Attendees rallied around calls to unseat South Dakota’s U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and Sens. Mike Rounds and John Thune, all Republicans. 
‘After all our hard work’: Federal fallout leads to suspension of interlibrary loan courier service

The state’s U.S. senators are in South Dakota this week, but not for town halls. Sen. Rounds spoke to the group Americans for Prosperity on Monday in Rapid City. Thune will be on hand for a ribbon-cutting at an Amazon delivery station in Box Elder Wednesday morning, and speak at a Pennington County Republican Women’s monthly luncheon in Rapid City shortly thereafter. A group called Indivisible Rapid City is planning a silent protest to coincide with the luncheon.
Gronli described the Sioux Falls event as bipartisan, but it was organized by the South Dakota Democratic Party. Many attendees identified themselves as Democrats when they rose to voice their concerns in the packed auditorium. 
Brandon resident Michael Nitz said he changed his party registration from Republican to Independent shortly after President Trump took office this year. There are efficiencies to be found in federal government, he said, but he doesn’t like the approach of the Trump administration or the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by Tesla founder Elon Musk.
Nitz voiced frustration over a lack of public events with the state’s Congressional delegation.
“You’re the only people who are answering my questions,” Nitz told the speakers, a group that included Gronli, as well as former South Dakota state Sen. Reynold Nesiba and 2026 Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Julian Beaudion. “I fired off emails and phone calls like you’re supposed to do to Rounds, Johnson and Thune. I’ve not gotten any response for that, so I’m getting tired.”
Tim Sundet, from Lake Preston, was visibly angry as he took the microphone and held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution.  He took issue with Homeland Security Secretary Noem’s plan to monitor immigrants’ social media activity for “antisemitism” and college students and faculty across the country being detained for participating in pro-Palestinian protests.
“You have the right to assemble. It is in the Constitution and yet they don’t care. Where are our members of Congress? What are they doing about it?” Sundet said.
Attendees also expressed discontent with Trump’s cabinet picks, including Noem, the former South Dakota governor, spoke of what they see as an uncertain future for Medicaid and other federal programs, and about Trump’s unstable tariff policies. 
Nesiba said tariffs will hurt South Dakota farmers.
Soybeans are China’s top agricultural import from the U.S., totaling $12.8 billion in 2024, according to the USDA. Soybeans are South Dakota’s top agricultural export, valued at $1.6 billion in 2022.
“What I worry about is that this might not be temporary. When a country starts to have relationships with somebody else – that they’re getting their soybeans from Brazil and their beef from Australia – then it’s harder for us to get those markets back,” Nesiba said. “We spent a lot of money building those trade relationships over time, and in a matter of 100 days we’ve burned a lot of goodwill around the world in those relationships.”

Beaudion, Gronli and Nesiba encouraged attendees to engage respectfully with elected officials at all levels, as well as with family members and neighbors supportive of Trump administration policy.
“If we put a lot of pressure on those local officials, then I promise you our state Legislature will hear it because they’ll be pressured,” Beaudion said, “and then our federal officials will hear it because our legislators and the state will be pressured.”
Beaudion also suggested that attendees could run for state and local office.
Gronli said stories collected from the sessions and through online forms will be compiled into a report that’ll be sent to Johnson, Rounds and Thune’s offices.
Town halls will also be held in Vermillion on April 24 and in Aberdeen on April 28.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-16 04:01:06+00:00,CT Mirror,Beyond the birds and bees: Why CT kids need comprehensive sexual education,Sandhya Sanapala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/16/beyond-the-birds-and-bees-why-ct-kids-need-comprehensive-sexual-education/,"We must advocate for laws that mandate medically accurate, inclusive sexual education in Connecticut Schools.","For generations, “the birds and the bees” has been the go-to metaphor for introducing kids to the basics of sex and relationships. But many parents still feel uncomfortable or unsure when it comes to having that conversation, especially given the ever-evolving nature of relationships, sexual health and gender identity. 
As a medical student, I’ve had children ask me: “What is sex?” “What is a healthy relationship?” and some even share personal stories about their gender identity and sexuality. I’ve also had many parents ask me: “When do I bring it up?” “What do I say?” and most commonly and relatable to many, “I wasn’t given the talk by my parents, I got it from school.” 

Sanya Sanapala
So, what do we do about this situation? We must advocate for the requirement of medically accurate sex education curriculum in public schools, as well as education pertaining to gender identity, sexual orientation and consent.
Many schools teach to the abstinence curriculum, which is what I was taught at my school. But is this effective? A study by Stanger-Hall in 2011 looked at 48 states (excluding Wyoming and North Dakota) of which 39 states either covered, emphasized, or stressed abstinence-only education. It was shown that the average teen pregnancy rate increased with an increased level of abstinence education. 
The states that stressed abstinence had an average birth rate of 73.24 teen pregnancies per 1,000 girls. The states that covered abstinence education had an average birth rate of 56.36 teen pregnancies per 1,000 girls. The issue goes beyond just what we teach about abstinence, it also lies in the gaps within the curriculum in Connecticut.
The Connecticut Department of Education sets guidelines for sex education in public schools, but does not set requirements. Specifically, there is no curriculum requirement to include topics such as gender identity, sexual orientation, or even consent. In addition, Connecticut also has no statute regarding medically accurate sex education instruction. This is particularly concerning to me as a future healthcare provider.
I strongly urge legislation in Connecticut to require medically accurate sex education curriculum. Medically accurate education involves providing information that is up-to-date, scientifically supported, and free from ideological bias. It ensures that students receive the correct facts about sexual health, contraception, and the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 
Comprehensive education is linked to lower rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV as young people who are informed about prevention are more likely to take protective measures. A 2021 study in the Journal of Adolescent Health found that comprehensive, medically accurate sex education has been shown to delay sexual initiation, increase contraceptive use and safe sex practices, and reduce the number of sexual partners among adolescents. Governments have an obligation to provide accurate information to their citizens, and that includes students.
Furthermore, legislation should mandate topics such as gender identity, sexual orientation, and consent be included in sexual education curriculum. It is important to promote inclusivity and respect for diversity while fostering a supportive education environment for students. A 2019 survey by the Trevor Project found that nearly half (40%) of LGBTQ+ youth and more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth have seriously considered suicide this past year. With inclusive education, we can validate these students’ identities and improve outcomes. According to a Human Rights Campaign survey in 2018, 94% of LGBTQ+ students who receive inclusion lessons reported feeling safer in school. 
We all want the same thing for our children: to grow up healthy, informed, and capable of making good decisions. Regardless of our personal beliefs or backgrounds, we can agree that in an increasingly complex world, we want our children to have accurate information to navigate it. Providing comprehensive, medically accurate sexual education equips them to make safer choices, respect others, and understand their own health and relationships. By investing in better education, we are investing in their future, creating a society where every student, no matter their identity or background, can thrive and succeed.
But this change won’t happen without action. I urge readers to contact their legislators and advocate for laws that mandate medically accurate, inclusive sexual education in Connecticut Schools. Share this message with your schools, whether that means talking to school boards, writing to local newspapers, or using social media to spread awareness. Or maybe joining organizations like Planned Parenthood or GLSEN which are already making efforts to push for these necessary changes. 
Every voice matters in ensuring that the next generation has access to the knowledge they deserve. Let’s make comprehensive sex education a reality for all students in Connecticut.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThree people were arrested, two of them shocked with a Taser and about six people were escorted out of the building as Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene held a town hall in Acworth Tuesday.

“We aren’t going to be intimidated by funded Democrats that want to come in and scream and yell,” Greene said after the meeting at the Acworth Community Center in Cobb County. “A town hall is information for our constituents, and this is not a political rally, this is not a campaign rally, and town halls are extremely important. I’m glad they got thrown out, that’s exactly what I wanted to see happen.”
The first arrest came just after the town hall began when one man loudly booed Greene and was dragged into the hallway by police and shocked with a Taser at least twice. Shortly after he was taken away, police could be seen scuffling with another man in the crowd, eventually using the Taser on him as well.
A woman was arrested near the end of the event after she shouted profanities at Greene while she was on the stage.

According to police, the first man was charged with misdemeanor simple battery on a police officer and misdemeanor obstruction. The second man was charged with misdemeanor simple battery on a police officer and felony obstruction, and the woman was charged with violating a city ordinance on vulgar language, a misdemeanor.
Greene spent the roughly hour-long town hall praising President Donald Trump’s second term, crediting him with lowering border crossings, cutting government waste and seeking a ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors.
A long-time Trump ally and conservative firebrand, Greene has gone from being banished from House committees a few years ago to now chairing the subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is part of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
A heated political climate
Greene was one of only a handful of Congressional Republicans who planned a town hall during the current two-week recess, which comes about a month after party leadership advised lawmakers to avoid in-person town halls, according to reports.
The north Georgia congresswoman held the town hall in the more left-leaning corner of her otherwise ruby red district. Greene told reporters after the town hall that she had been planning the event since January.
Other Republicans, including Georgia Congressman Rich McCormick, have seen fiery town hall meetings where they have been grilled by peeved voters on issues like Trump’s executive powers and Elon Musk’s DOGE and its cuts to federal programs.

Democrats said the angry interactions are a sign of dissatisfaction with Trump’s new administration. Republicans largely dismissed them as paid protesters or rabble rousers traveling in from out of the district and recommended elected officials host telephone town halls or engage with constituents in other ways meant to minimize public disruptions.
The crowd at Greene’s town hall was mostly friendly, but some constituents could be heard scoffing or otherwise expressing their unhappiness – several interrupted the event by shouting or, in one case, unfurling a sign reading “Jail 4 Inside Traders.”
Alleged insider trading
Greene went into the town hall embroiled in what opponents call an insider trading scandal.
A Congressional report shows Greene bought between $21,000 and $315,000 in stocks on April 8 and 9, the day before and the day that Trump announced a pause on his tariff plan. The tariffs had put the market into a tailspin and the announcement of the pause caused a surge, allowing anyone who bought low to make a tidy profit.
Democrats allege that Greene made the trades with foreknowledge of the pause in violation of insider trading laws. Greene rejects the charges as a partisan smear.
Greene told reporters she had no advanced knowledge of the tariff pause.
“I have a fiduciary agreement with my portfolio manager. I don’t place my buys myself,” she said. “That’s something that my portfolio manager does for me, and he did a great job. Guess what he did? He bought the dip. And that’s what anybody that has any financial sense does when they know the market’s going to be going down. That was obvious to everyone.”
An imperfect screen

Greene’s office made efforts to screen attendees for Tuesday’s meeting, requiring them to fill out a form in advance that included their home address and then show ID at the door to prove their identities. Greene’s staff screened attendees for residency in the district, but one of the men who was arrested carried an ID that placed him outside of it, according to police.
Reporters were told not to interview any attendees, and rather than taking questions from the audience, she answered questions that people had written and submitted when they signed up for the town hall.
Most of the questions were friendly, though a few more hostile queries made their way into the program, including “Why are you such a coward in the face of an obvious fascist takeover?”
Greene laughed off her detractors’ questions and characterized them as misinformed, earning applause from the crowd when she did so.
She told reporters she read pre-screened questions because of eye trouble.

“We always have people write down their questions. The problem is, it’s difficult to read everyone’s handwriting,” she said. “So normally, they write down a question and they put them in a fishbowl for me, and I usually have to put on my reading glasses and read them, but it was much easier to have them type out their questions on the form when they signed up for the town hall.”
Greene’s district is one of the most conservative in the state, stretching from the solidly red northwest corner of the state to include northwest Cobb County, which is part of metro Atlanta. Cobb was once a Republican stronghold but has become much friendlier to Democrats over the years as a younger and more diverse population moves in, particularly in the southern part of the county.
Over 100 protesters were gathered outside as Greene spoke – at times, their chants or the honks of passing cars could be heard during the town hall.
Among the crowd was Clarence Blalock, a Democrat who plans to run against Greene when she is up for reelection in 2026.

Blalock said Democrats in the district feel like Greene likes to make a big show but doesn’t listen to their needs.
“She screens her questions, she screens her people, everything is pre-screened, so this is not a real town hall,” he said. “If you can pick your questions beforehand, and your people, and you make sure they’re Republicans – and even to contact her, you’ve got to put in your ZIP+4, which is not necessary at all. She has no representation in the district.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska legislators confront a major state budget deficit, the state Senate on Tuesday voted unanimously to approve a “bare bones” $162 million capital budget to pay for construction and renovation projects across the state.
The spending plan, which would take effect July 1, remains a draft subject to approval by the House. Gov. Mike Dunleavy may also make line-item vetoes.
The budget bill passed by the Senate is almost entirely limited to the minimum needed to unlock more than $2.5 billion in federal grants for road maintenance and other priorities.
With oil revenue down and costs up — including the Permanent Fund dividend — analysts are projecting a significant budget deficit for the coming year. On Friday, the House voted to reduce the proposed 2025 dividend, but not enough to erase the deficit.
To help the issue, members of the Senate Finance Committee clawed back millions of dollars previously allocated to construction projects, reducing the need for new state revenue to pay for the capital budget.
Among the clawbacks: $37 million set aside for the Juneau Access Project, an effort to improve road and ferry service to the capital city.
“To even get to the bare-bones capital budget, my district ended up contributing half a dozen ribs and a femur. … I’m not pleased,” said Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau and a member of the Senate Finance Committee.
Other notable clawbacks included $10 million for a proposed deep-draft port in Nome, and $138,611 remaining in an account to be used for Ketchikan’s proposed Gravina Island Bridge, once dubbed the “bridge to nowhere.”
Members of the finance committee also turned to the state-owned investment bank, the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, for an additional $12.5 million above the $20 million already pledged by the bank to the state treasury. 
Budgeters rejected some of Dunleavy’s budget requests: $2.5 million for a proposed road in the western portion of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, $4.2 million for development of the trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline, $2.5 million for firefighting aircraft, and $6.5 million for a new state plane to be used for emergency response.
They also rejected all $3.2 billion in requests from individual legislators for their specific districts.
Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, called the result “a fair and balanced approach” in a statement released after the vote.
Some projects saw reduced funding: A $6.5 million request to expand the Bradley Lake hydroelectric project’s capacity was cut to $6 million. Bradley Lake is among the cheapest sources of electricity on the Railbelt. 
The Senate’s biggest addition was $19 million for major maintenance at public schools — the governor had proposed no funding for the major maintenance list.
“This is just the beginning of many tough decisions you’re going to see over the next few weeks, between now and the end of May, and I don’t think some of the folks in the building have quite grasped that yet,” said Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee in charge of the capital budget.

Petitions must be submitted to the Arkansas Secretary of State's office by Friday. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ attorney general on Tuesday rejected for a second time a proposed ballot measure to amend the state’s initiative and referendum process. 
Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin noted in an opinion prepared by Senior Assistant Attorney General Kelly Summerside that while proponents had resolved several issues preventing certification of the initial proposal, one issue remained and others were created. 
Little Rock attorney David Couch submitted the revised proposed constitutional amendment on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Arkansas on March 31. State law requires the attorney general to approve or reject a proposed ballot measure within 10 business days, and Tuesday was the deadline.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas expressed disappointment in Griffin’s decision in an emailed statement and reiterated its commitment to submitting a revised proposal.
“Protecting the people’s right to propose and vote on laws is foundational to a healthy democracy,” LWV Arkansas President Bonnie Miller said. “This amendment is necessary to protect and safeguard our constitutional right to direct democracy. We are not giving up.”
Among other things, the initial proposal sought to change the attorney general’s role in reviewing ballot titles, but the language of the proposed ballot measure ensured there would be times the AG would be unable to act, Griffin wrote. 
In an attempt to remedy the issue, the LWV Arkansas made a few edits to its proposal, including one that would require that the attorney general must only certify that the popular name is not misleading, rather than certify that both the popular name and ballot title are not misleading. This still did not resolve the problem, Griffin wrote. 
“Your current submission runs into the same problem as your previous submission: it again misleadingly suggests that the Attorney General will always approve some version of a submitted ballot title, while creating a system that ensures the Attorney General will at times be unable to certify a ballot title,” the opinion states. 
Griffin’s Tuesday opinion also noted issues with consistency with terms in sections of the state Constitution, as well as grammatical issues.
There is no limit to how many times a group may submit a proposed ballot measure. The attorney general’s office has already certified three other ballot title proposals that address education, government transparency and taxes on feminine hygiene products for the 2026 election cycle.
The Legislature can also refer up to three constitutional amendments as ballot measures for 2026. It had not finalized its decisions as of Tuesday.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)I strongly oppose the change to Alaska’s Constitution to allow spending from a proposed single-component Permanent Fund. 
Today, the Permanent Fund has two components, its principal account and earnings reserve account. The principal is nonspendable and, accordingly, is the “permanent” part of the Permanent Fund. The ERA is, at present, the only component that money can be spent from. 
The fund’s website says its “goal should be to maintain safety of principal.”  
Merriam-Webster defines the word permanent as “stable: continuing or enduring without fundamental or marked change.” The Permanent Fund exists because Alaska’s Constitution was designed to prohibit spending the principal. Don’t change Alaska’s Constitution. 
Political impulses within Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. want to change Alaska’s Constitution by eliminating the ERA. That proposal creates a single-component fund from which withdrawals are taken. In doing that, real risks emerge to maintaining the safety of the principal.
In 2017, Alaska created the percent-of-market-value distribution, and set the current withdrawal rate at 5% of the fund’s total market value. The 5% distribution from the ERA is now approximately $3.7 billion to $4 billion per year for roads, airports, troopers, schools, etc.  
The theory driving a possible constitutional change is a nearly 50% chance that the 5% distribution will, within a decade, fully deplete the ERA, leaving only the nonspendable principal. A fully depleted ERA immediately crushes the operation of government. But, the answer is not to make the principal spendable. 
The proposed constitutional change converts the current two-component system to a single-component system. The 5% distribution would be withdrawn from this single-component system. Because the principal becomes spendable, the Permanent Fund could be spent down to nothing. The word “permanent” is gone. Risks to maintaining the safety of the principal arise. 
Consider this question: If the 5% withdrawal rate for the current POMV is a factor in fully depleting the ERA, isn’t it obvious that, if constitutional protection of the principal is removed, a 5% withdrawal rate from a single-component Permanent Fund can — and will — deplete the principal?  The answer is, “Yes, of course.” Removing constitutional protection of the principal destroys the safety of the principal. Permanent becomes impermanent. 
It is important to understand how Alaska got here and the magnitude of money spent from savings from 2013 to now. For the fiscal years 2014-2018, the state average deficit was about $3 billion per year; deficits resulted in spending about $18 billion from Alaska’s Statutory Budget Reserve and Constitutional Budget Reserve accounts to pay the bills. After substantial depletion of those accounts, the percent-of-market-value distributionwas needed. So, the spendable ERA was accessed. The ERA was the next pot of money to deplete. About $3.5 billion-plus per year was then withdrawn from the ERA; the total spending from ERA savings is more than $20 billion. Money forever gone.   
The constitutional proposal intends to change the nonspendable principal to spendable — so it can next be spent.
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing again and again while expecting a different result. Alaska has already spent about $18 billion from Alaska’s Statutory Budget Reserve and Constitutional Budget Reserve accounts. Then the 5% withdrawal rate reduced the ERA by billions per year. The ERA may be fully depleted within the decade.  
If we change the constitution to allow the same 5% withdrawal rate upon a single-component Permanent Fund, we are insane to expect a different result other than eventual depletion of the principal. A 5% withdrawal rate eventually depletes the Permanent Fund. 
History shows the actual risk of complete depletion of the principal. This is not fantasy. Over $40 billion from previous savings is forever gone.  
And please do not talk about the Willow project and other projects in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska providing billions for Alaska’s budgets. NPR-A is federal land which means Alaska gets 0% royalty. Plus, under Alaska’s current production tax system, Alaska only receives about 4% of the gross value of oil’s price from federal and state land. And, due to political forces, NPR-A development expenses are deducted from Alaska-owned Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk oil fields, costing Alaska hundreds of millions in revenue each year. 
Of course, the push to change Alaska’s Constitution — to spend the Permanent Fund principal until it too is depleted — avoids the reality that a serious look into revenue sources can no longer be ignored. 
I oppose any change to Alaska’s Constitution which allows spending the Permanent Fund principal. The word “permanent” must remain substantive and real. Remove constitutional nonspendable protection of the principal and eventually all of it will be spent.  
I oppose removing constitutional protection of the principal.

DeAnn Vaught addresses the House regarding SB290 on April 15, 2025. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas House passed a bill Tuesday that would maintain a permit moratorium for hog farms in the Buffalo River watershed, while setting out a process for future watershed-based bans to be considered by lawmakers. 
Senate Bill 290 now nears the end of a long-running legislative process that began at the beginning of the session, spanning multiple amendments, before finally passing the Senate earlier this month.
The Senate will need to concur in the amendment introduced last week before SB 290 is sent to the governor’s desk.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders previously released statements saying she didn’t support any legislation that did not protect the Buffalo — a key tourism driver — but pivoted to support it last week after it was amended again.
Bill amended to protect existing Buffalo River watershed moratorium

During remarks on the House floor, Horatio Republican Rep. DeAnn Vaught, the House sponsor, apologized to her fellow members for the number of constituent communications they had received regarding the bill. 
She said that the issue of the moratoriums had become “political,” instead of being based in science. Vaught added that she did not believe the original versions of the bill, which would have removed or made it easier to remove existing moratoriums, would have hurt the Buffalo River.
“Some of you asked why we didn’t exclude the Buffalo River and Lake Maumelle to begin with. My answer is because the moratorium that was put on … the Buffalo River actually made the farmer look like he had done something wrong, when science had proven he had done nothing wrong,” Vaught said.
She said the final version of SB 290 would give legislators a seat at the table for any future moratorium, adding that lawmakers had been forced out of the decision when it was made a decade ago.
“We lost a voice in the earlier fights with the Buffalo River watershed. Our voice was taken from us,” Vaught said of legislators having a say in permit moratoriums. 
She added: “Farmers work hard, they are conservationists; they are environmentalists.”
The Department of Energy and Environment and the Department of Agriculture — both of which are in charge of administrative rules that currently contain the moratorium — support the bill with the latest amendments. 
Shane Khoury, the Energy and Environment secretary, said last week that the amended bill would allow it to continue protecting the Buffalo River watershed, while addressing concerns raised by Vaught regarding farmers who were already in the watershed.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The Forward Party, a political party whose members say they want a return to civility in politics and improvements to U.S. democracy, announced Tuesday it is seeking 3,500 signatures to secure minor party status in New Mexico.
The New Mexico chapter’s launch comes after what members tout as a major success a decade in the making: A new state law allowing unaffiliated voters to cast ballots in primary elections here. 
Bob Perls, New Mexico Forward Party chair and a former state representative, championed that effort since 2015. He told a small group gathered at a historic church in Corrales on Tuesday afternoon that a major focus of the Forward Party in New Mexico will be those types of democratic improvements, like taking on unfairness in the redistricting process, campaign finance reform, and empowering more people to vote in races where there are meaningful choices on the ballot. 
“If you look at what is the root cause of hyper-partisanship and political polarization in this country, you can trace a lot of it to how we elect, district and finance candidates,” Perls said. 
NM House narrowly endorses open primaries for unaffiliated voters

The party hopes to collect enough signatures to endorse and recruit candidates to run in the 2026 midterm elections. It will likely not have enough support or resources to weigh in on the Albuquerque mayoral elections this year, said spokesperson Karin Williams. 
Perls also said the party would target members of both parties who voted to keep New Mexico’s primaries closed and would seek to increase the number of candidates on the ballot across the state. 
In the most recent New Mexico legislative elections, more than one-third of candidates had already won their primaries on the day the primary election was held. That meant that 70% of registered Democrats and 78% of registered Republicans had one or zero House candidates to vote for that day, according to a Source New Mexico analysis. 
The group hopes that it can tap into what its leaders describe as widespread disenchantment with the two major political parties. As of December 2024, 340,000 New Mexico voters, roughly a quarter of all voters in the state, were not affiliated with any of the state’s three major parties, which are Democrats, Republicans or Libertarians, according to the Secretary of State’s Office. 
And 40% of New Mexico voters aged 18 to 24 are unaffiliated, said Rep. Cristina Parajón (D-Albuquerque), who sponsored the open-primary bill, during the House floor debate March 21.
The primary election is today. More than one-third of legislative candidates have already won. 

Andrew Yang, who unsuccessfully ran for president as a Democrat in 2020, founded the Forward Party in 2022. Its leaders now cite a number of “Forwardists,” most recently a Utah state senator who left the Republican Party to join the Forward Party last month. 
Christine Todd Whitman, the former New Jersey governor and Environmental Protection Agency secretary during George W. Bush’s presidency, is also a Forward Party leader. She joined Perls on Monday, saying the party is focused heavily on expanding its footprint in local races and statehouses, along with nationally, as part of its strategy to challenge two-party dominance. 
The Forward Party does not have much of a platform, apart from a pledge it requires candidates it supports. The pledge requires candidates to affirm their commitments to the rule of law and the Constitution, data-driven policy-making, and creating “a safe space to discuss controversial issues,” Todd Whitman said. 
“But we recognize that every state is different, and within states, you’re going to have different areas of issues, and that people need that flexibility,” Todd Whitman said. “Candidates need to be able to respond to their constituents.”
Todd Whitman said Forward Party, to her, represents a “centrist” alternative to two parties that have increasingly catered to extreme members of their own parties, though she suggested leaders might not want to market themselves as centrists. 
“That’s what we are, in a vacuum, and that’s what most of the people who are part of Forward are. They’re in the center,” she said. “They want to see the problem solved. They’re not extreme, which makes you in the center, but you have to find the right language.”

Heather Balas, a Democrat who lost her primary race for state Senate in 2024, asked what it would take for a third party to become competitive in New Mexico and across the country. William Scott, another Democrat, spoke up to say he was “hammered by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party,” for being a “centrist, Forward” Democrat. 
He ran unopposed in the primary but lost to Republican Ant Thornton for state Senate District 19. He said he needs more support from the Forward party, in terms of a campaign manager and fundraising, if he were to run again. 
“So I’m just wondering, what is the way forward?” he asked. Perls and Todd Whitman told him to run again, promising more support should he seek a state House seat in an upcoming election and noting that, if the party can get ballot access, he can skip the Democratic primary. 
“I think just bypassing the Democratic primary is going to make a huge difference for your ability to speak your mind and be true to yourself, and represent a far broader cross section of the voters than you would trying to appeal to the party base to get through the Democratic primary,” Perls told him. “Please run.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9453-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 21:00:27.667097

Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, speaks in opposition to House Bill 1365 from the Senate floor on April 15, 2025. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Senate on Tuesday approved legislation that would remove race and gender quotas and qualifications for a variety of state boards and commissions. The bill now awaits the governor’s signature. 
Rep. Karilyn Brown, a Sherwood Republican and lead sponsor of House Bill 1365, told a House committee last month that requiring a minimum number of women and members from underrepresented groups to serve on the panels is unfair. 
Brown said “diversity occurs naturally” and the state should not codify language that “makes things more awkward or more difficult to fill positions.”
HB 1365 advanced all the way to the Senate before being recalled to the House for an amendment that removed an entire section of the bill referencing the Arkansas Ethics Commission. Brown told the House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committees on April 2 that the revision was needed because the commission was created through an initiated act and therefore that section of code needed 67 votes in the House to be amended.
Panel OKs proposed removal of racial and gender quotas for Arkansas boards and commissions

HB 1365 originally passed the House with 61 votes on March 5. The vote was later expunged and the House approved the amended bill with 60 votes on April 3.   
Upon its return to the Senate on Tuesday, no one spoke in favor of HB 1365, and Sen. Clarke Tucker was the sole lawmaker to speak against it. Of all the bills related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) during the last two sessions, Tucker called HB 1365 “the most harmful.” 
DEI-related bills approved by lawmakers during the 2025 legislative session include Act 112, which will “prohibit discrimination or preferential treatment” by public entities and retention plans and reports from public school districts and higher education institutions, and Senate Bill 520, which would prohibit DEI policies and practices in local government. 
There’s no advantage to serving in unpaid positions on boards and committees, Tucker said, but removing quotas eliminates the opportunity for some people to have a voice in policymaking. Among the panels affected by the proposed law, Tucker singled out the State Board of Education, whose membership would no longer be required to “reflect the diversity in general education” under HB 1365.
“We are so afraid of diversity that we are eliminating that line from code; it doesn’t even say what kind of diversity,” he said. 
Diversity is important, Clarke said, noting that the Senate’s membership represents geographic diversity. 
“We have lost all common sense when it comes to that word because of the politics of the time, and this bill goes too far,” he said. “What it does again is eliminate the ability of populations who have been historically underrepresented or oppressed to even have a voice in their state government, and that is wrong and I hope we don’t pass it this afternoon.”
HB 1365 passed the Senate Tuesday with 24 yes votes; the body’s six Democrats voted no. Republican Ronald Caldwell of Wynne, Jonathan Dismang of Searcy, Jim Dotson of Bentonville and John Payton of Wilburn did not vote, while Jim Petty of Fort Smith voted present.

John Fuller championed a $55 million education bill by reminding the Senate of his fiscally conservative values.
“Some of you may know that I’m so tight, I squeak when I walk, but I do support public education, and I support it fiercely,” Fuller, R-Kalispell, said on Tuesday.
Sen. Sara Novak, a Democrat from Anaconda, said House Bill 252 isn’t perfect, but it’s a step in the right direction, and it will help especially small rural schools and young educators.
“It is some much-needed funding to our public schools to directly impact our teacher wages and specifically our beginning teacher wages,” Novak said.
The Senate voted 40-10 in favor of the STARS Act, or Student and Teacher Advancement for Results, sending it to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee for a closer fiscal analysis.
It’s among the bills to help public schools that one supporter said bolsters education without adding undue stress to already beleaguered residential property taxpayers.
Montana has struggled to increase starting teacher pay, and a proposal from the 2023 legislative session didn’t work as planned.
Backed by the Governor’s Office, HB 252 earned bipartisan support, although some critics said it doesn’t do enough for veteran teachers, who also need to be paid well.
Sponsor and Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, has said the bill aims to fix an ongoing problem, which is low pay for beginning teachers, and the state doesn’t have unlimited funds.
The bill would spend more than $110 million from the general fund in the biennium, according to the most recent fiscal analysis.
It also has other provisions to support education, such as incentives for academic achievement for students and tools to help teachers in areas with high housing costs.
After the Senate floor vote, Lance Melton, with the Montana School Boards Association, said funding proposals before the legislature, including the STARS Act, have been written to guard against a spike in local property taxes.
Property tax income goes in part toward public schools.
“All of those proposals have two — front and center — primary stakeholders, the child and the taxpayer,” Melton said.
The fiscal analysis estimates an increase to local school property taxes of $800,000 a year, but those dollars are associated with housing support voters might approve through local levies, not incentives for teachers.
Melton pointed also to House Bill 483 and House Bill 515, which both passed out of the House with bipartisan support and are in the Senate.
Sponsored by Rep. Courtenay Sprunger, R-Kalispell, HB 483 would take any revenue growth that exceeds the state’s obligation to a school equalization fund and return it to taxpayers.
It has other Republicans and Democrats as co-sponsors and passed with a bipartisan 87-11 vote out of the House.
House Bill 515, sponsored by Rep. Linda Reksten, R-Polson, would in part help schools with major maintenance costs without asking property taxpayers for a levy or a bond.
On the House floor, Reksten said it has support from the Governor’s Office.
She said the bill transfers $75 million of one-time-only money from the general fund surplus to fill the school facilities trust fund — without affecting property taxpayers.

(Photo by Blair Miller)A federal judge has granted an emergency restraining order which will prevent U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting two Montana State University graduate students who were notified that their status as foreign students was being revoked.
Montana University System officials reported last week that at least four students in the state had their F-1 visas revoked and their F-1 status terminated. Each of the students say that the federal government was revoking their status, even though the students had not been notified, had not been convicted of a crime, and had not received notice of the change. Two of the students, both graduate-level students in Bozeman have challenged the decision in federal court and are being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana.
In an emergency motion filed Monday, the ACLU claims that the students learned of the status change as the university system was handling routine status checks. The federal government, through Noem, didn’t just eliminate their F-1 visa, which allow a student to enter the country; the department cancelled their entire F-1 status, meaning that the students could deported at any time.
One student in the Montana lawsuit is a doctoral student in electrical engineering, the other is a master’s level student in microbiology. Both are reportedly set to graduate from their programs during 2025.
In an emergency ruling on Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Dana L. Christensen found that the case was similar to one in New Hampshire in which the court also found that the federal government had not followed its own procedures for revoking the status, and violated a number of due-process protections, which allows a student to challenge the decision before an independent court.
Attorneys for the federal government have not made their appearance to defend the Trump administration’s decision, but Christensen noted in his ruling on Tuesday afternoon that attorneys for the ACLU had been trying to get a response from the U.S. District Attorney’s Office in Montana.
“As of the date of this order, defendants have not responded to plaintiffs’ motion,” Christensen noted in his order.
The temporary restraining order says that officials must restore the students’ status and must not initiate deportation proceedings for two weeks. It also stops Homeland Security from ordering their “arrest, detention or transfer” from Montana without proper notice and a chance for attorneys to contest the action.
Christensen set a court hearing for the matter on April 29 in Missoula, and ordered the federal government to respond by then.
“The court finds that the plaintiffs are likely succeed on the allegation that (Homeland Security’s) termination of (their) F-1 student status … is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, contrary to constitutional right, contrary to law, and in excess of statutory jurisdiction,” Christensen said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3666-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-15 20:07:20.334851

In Logan, a student athlete said he often scavenged pizza from a dumpster. In West Valley City, a student who lived in a car said she had no way to cook food like mac and cheese that her family got from a food bank. In the Granite School District, a social worker described the academic decline of a student who is often hungry because of financial difficulties. 
Utah is still far from establishing a universal free lunch program in public schools. However, lawmakers approved a first step to expand who gets to access meals at no cost this year with HB100, a bill Gov. Spencer Cox ceremoniously signed on Tuesday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“This bill and what it accomplishes isn’t just about providing school lunch, it’s about helping kids learn, and kids can’t learn when they’re hungry,” Cox said on Tuesday. “So we appreciate those hardworking class families who do so much to take care of their kids, and we know that this can alleviate just one more of those burdens for those that are struggling the most.”
Utah appears ready to spend millions on free meals for eligible students

The legislation allows those who qualify for reduced-cost meals to access the free lunch program in Utah, approving a one-time payment of $2.5 million to support the program.  
The bill also prohibits schools from publicly identifying or stigmatizing a student unable to pay for a meal, or from requiring them to perform chores to make up for the cost. Additionally, it provides students longer lunch breaks to avoid food waste, and allows unopened food to be returned for redistribution. 
Currently, students in households with incomes at or below 130% of federal poverty levels qualify for federal free school meals. With Utah’s legislation that will become effective on July 1, those in the state with incomes between 130% and 185% of the poverty level, who could previously only access reduced meal fees, would be eligible for free lunches. 
Overall, it would benefit about 40,000 Utah children. 
The food insecurity issue was well known in the state, but it received special attention when FOX13 revealed that the combined school lunch debt in Utah was about $1.7 million in 2023. That number grew to $2.8 million in 2024.    
While no one is denied a meal in schools, according to FOX13, the debt may follow students throughout their school years, and may forbid them from walking in their graduation. 
Last year, Cox redirected $1.2 million in federal COVID-19 relief to start a grant program to address the debt. However, he said on Tuesday, up until now there wasn’t a permanent solution to the issue.    
To help settle $2.8 million in school lunch debt, Gov. Cox finds $1.2 million. What about the rest?

It wasn’t the first time the bill sponsor, Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, proposed legislation like HB100. In 2024, a request for $4 million in appropriations to expand the school lunch program failed to make it to the state’s budget. 
“This bill, while exciting in many ways, just shows that the process does work. Shows that when people come together who are really unified on a key issue, like Gov. Cox said, that hungry kids cannot learn in the classroom, and we’re spending $7 billion on education. Well, let’s do something about that,” Clancy said on Tuesday. “And that’s how this bill came to be.”
In Utah, 1 in 6 children face food insecurity, Clancy told the Senate Education Committee in March. All of them are from working families that don’t qualify for assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), often known as food stamps, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). 
After the signing ceremony Emily Bell McCormick, president of the Policy Project, a nonprofit that promotes solution-based policies in the state and supported the legislation, described passing the bill as “a battle,” but she was glad to finally see it come to fruition.



Let us know what you think...


 


“We all understand the burden that’s on us when it comes to this, especially with rising housing costs and the cost of living being more expensive here in the state of Utah,” she said. “Spending $12 a day on a school lunch if you have three or four kids, it’s pretty difficult. It’s difficult for those families who barely make ends meet.”  
It was a challenge to find ways for the state to pay for school lunches in an efficient manner, Bell McCormick said. However, the bill authors were able to identify those who aren’t getting any other assistance, and may be stuck working multiple jobs to sustain their families. 
“When we looked at that, and then you look at how much we spend on education, billions of dollars (…) and the cost of this is less than $3 million,” she said. “And so it really increases a child’s chance of learning.”

But on day 76 of a maximum 90 day session, legislators were still debating a couple of key proposals they’d debated back in January.
Senate President Matt Regier said on Tuesday there was a chance the discussion could come to a “stalemate” but also described the discussion around property taxes as “right there.”
He went on to say some of the slow roll dealt with legislators wanting to see their bills get through before the session ends, which could impact how they vote on property tax proposals.
Property tax reform is seen as the major obstacle to the Legislature coming to a close. Deals and amendments to bills have been circulating and likely will only increase in number as the session gets closer to the finish line.
In his state-of-the-state address in January, Gov Greg Gianforte called on the legislature to send the homestead rate cut proposal to his desk within a month —  a deadline that passed without action. At a press conference last week, Gov. Greg Gianforte said his position on prioritizing property tax relief hadn’t changed. 
“Montanans sent us here to act to get the job done, and we must,” Gianforte said last week. “I remain committed to cutting taxes for Montanans at every income level, leaving them more of their hard-earned money.”
Tuesday, Regier said it’s a matter of getting the “property tax pieces” together.
“And once we do that, I think the floodgates will break, at least here in the Senate,” Regier said.
Executive action on a number of bills currently in the Senate Taxation Committee is expected on Wednesday morning, with the chair of the committee, Sen. Greg Hertz, saying they were looking to clear out their docket.
Some Republicans have pushed the Governor’s Homestead Act, House Bill 231, which changes some rates and targets second homes, but the bill has seen obstacles in the Senate after getting through the House. It was tabled in the Senate tax committee but revived a week later.
Several cities, including Billings, have said it will increase property taxes in their locales, or cut services, like police and firefighters. Regier also noted concern on raising taxes on second homes from conservative members of his caucus.
“Raising Montana’s property taxes, whether that’s them doing an Airbnb or, like the family cabin, they said to me, that’s it,” Regier said. “I think for a lot of Republicans on this side, it’s a no go.”
One option some Republicans, including Regier, have pushed is Senate Bill 90, which aims to provide a property tax credit and is also at a standstill.
It would use lodging tax and rental car revenue to fund the credits. Some Democrats have bristled at the idea a rebate is the property tax solution Montanans are looking for.
“Last sessions, Band-Aid rebate checks were not enough,” House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan said on Tuesday. “Taxes have grown higher.”
SB 90 has already passed through the Senate, but did not make it through committees on the House side. An attempt to use a blast motion to move the bill onto the House floor narrowly failed on April 11, but SB 90 could be blasted again, Regier said. He said it could be implemented quickly and its funding stream was flexible.
“We could pass SB 90 right now, have it to the governor’s desk by Friday, and then the very next week … we could dump in one-time only money,” Regier said
During a press conference on Tuesday, Democratic leadership blamed Republicans for not being serious about property tax relief and not taking enough time on the issue.
Sullivan brought a clock with her to the press conference, saying she’d used it to track the amount of time spent arguing over “bathrooms, abortions and talking about chemtrails.”
The mood from their caucus was, in short, frustrated.
“We spend an incredibly large amount of our time on the floor debating things that have nothing to do with taxes,” Sullivan said. “If you were to compare it to the amount of time we spent on property taxes, there’s a huge difference.”
Democratic leadership also hinted that Rep. Jonathan Karlen’s House Bill 154, which is a targeted property tax credit toward renters, may also come off the table.
Rep. Ed Byrne’s House Bill 528 had a hearing earlier this week and it passed out of the House with significant bipartisan support. The bill was amended by Sen. Emma Kerr-Carpenter, D-Billings, to attempt to alleviate a potential conflict with city charters, like Billings’. The amendment would direct cities to ignore mill levy limits in their charters, though it’s unclear if that has legal standing.
But Byrne, a representative from Bigfork, also mentioned SB 90 during his testimony, saying it “stands on its own (and) is probably the best bill out here for what we’re looking at.”
The legislature does have other options, including a proposal from Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, to freeze property taxes for two years. On that bill, Regier said, “everything is on the table.”
Democrats, meanwhile, said it wasn’t nearly enough.
“That’s kind of kicking the can down the road,” Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade said. “And that’s in some ways no better, and maybe worse, than a rebate.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gettyimages-1190995919-170667a.jpg,,,2025-04-15 20:07:20.334851
,DC,2025-04-15 23:46:14+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"In first post-White House address, Biden pans Trump on Social Security",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/first-post-white-house-address-biden-pans-trump-social-security,,"Former President Joe Biden on Tuesday used his first public address since leaving office to criticize the current administration for cutting thousands of employees at the Social Security Administration and to rebut those who have questioned the program’s relevance.“In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage and so much destruction. It's kind of breathtaking it could happen that soon,” Biden said. “They've taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration, pushing 7,000 employees — 7,000 — out the door in that time, including the most seasoned career officials.”The Social Security Administration announced earlier this year it would cut staffing from 57,000 to 50,000 employees and reduce the number of regional offices from 10 to four.Biden urged Republicans to preserve Social Security for future generations, arguing during his 30-minute speech to the national conference of Advocates, Counselors, and Representatives for the Disabled in Chicago that people have been able to rely on it throughout wars, recessions and the pandemic.“Social Security is about more than retirement accounts. It’s about honoring a fundamental trust between government and people,” Biden said. “It's about peace of mind for those who work their whole lives, so they can rest assured they’ll have a chance to get back some of what they earned and what they deserve.”Biden, who accepted the organization’s Beacon of Hope award, said protecting Social Security and the federal workers who administer the program is about defending core principles.“Who are we? What makes us distinct from the rest of the world?” Biden asked. “It comes down to basic, in my view, fundamental American values — nobody's king, nobody's the boss. Everybody has a shot.” Biden criticized members of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet for making harsh comments about the program. He noted Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said his mother-in-law wouldn’t complain if she missed a Social Security payment and that “the easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen because whoever screams is the one stealing.”Biden also called out billionaire and head of U.S. DOGE Service Elon Musk for calling Social Security a “Ponzi scheme.”“​​What the hell are they talking about?” Biden said. “People earn these benefits. They paid into that benefit. They rely on that benefit.”White House pledges to maintain programWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing several hours before Biden’s speech the Trump administration doesn’t plan to cut off Americans’ Social Security benefits.“Let me make it very clear ahead of former President Biden’s remarks: The president, this president, President Trump is absolutely certain about protecting Social Security benefits for law-abiding, tax-paying American citizens and seniors who have paid into this program,” she said. “He will always protect that program. He campaigned on it. He protected it in his first term.”Leavitt also took a swipe at Biden’s age, saying she didn’t expect him to give a speech during the evening.“My first reaction when seeing former President Biden was speaking tonight was, I’m shocked that he was speaking at nighttime. I had thought his bedtime was much earlier than his speech tonight,” she said. Biden, 82, last year dropped his reelection bid in a rematch against Trump, 78, amid concerns about his age and mental acuity.Administrator nominee to target errorsDemocrats have raised concerns for months that staffing cuts at the Social Security Administration will impact Americans’ ability to get their questions about the program answered or their issues resolved quickly.Social Security Commissioner nominee Frank Bisignano testified during his hearing in March that, if confirmed, he would try to “ensure that every beneficiary receives their payments on time, that disability claims are processed in the manner they should be.”Bisignano said he hoped to ensure Social Security recipients could visit an office, use the website, or speak to a real person after calling the 1-800 number.“On the phone, I'm committed to reducing wait times and providing beneficiaries with a better experience; waiting 20 minutes-plus to get an answer will be of yesteryear,” Bisignano said. “I also believe we can significantly improve the length of the disability claim process.”Bisignano promised lawmakers he would reduce the 1% error rate in payments, which he said was “five decimal places too high.” And he said repeatedly that personally identifiable information will be “protected.”The Senate Finance Committee voted along party lines in early April to send Bisignano’s nomination to the floor, but he hasn’t yet been confirmed.",,,,2025-04-15 20:07:20.334851

But it will likely be finalized in a conference committee.,"Sen. Mike Crider, R-Greenfield, speaks from the Senate floor during the 2025 legislative session. (Courtesy Indiana Senate Republicans)A package of funding options for local transportation infrastructure — sparked by an impending fiscal cliff — passed Indiana’s Senate on Tuesday. But it will likely be finalized in a conference committee, per a key lawmaker.
“We’ve coordinated closely with the city of Indianapolis and other major units (of government) to try to get more funding on the landscape to more effectively handle our road needs,” said Sen. Mike Crider, the measure’s sponsor.
He cited increasing fuel efficiency, inflation, electric vehicles, alternative fuel and more as complicating the financial future for local roads and bridges.
Lawmakers seek road-funding changes, hope to avoid fiscal cliff

House Bill 1461 would change up the popular Community Crossings Matching Grant Program, raise the speed limit on Interstate 465 and let local governments tap into excess township funds, among numerous other provisions.
Crider read aloud a message from the Indiana Township Association that said its members didn’t want to be included in the legislation, but that it was “inevitable” and that the organization is comfortable with the language.
“I think this bill is going to conference committee, and I’m happy to work with them,” Crider added. “I have not heard anything further today from them, and so, based on that, I’m assuming we’re okay. But I can assure the members of the chamber that both (author) Rep. (Jim) Pressel and myself were in constant communication with all the players in this discussion.”
He also noted opinions diverge on language allowing the Indiana Department of Transportation to submit a request to the Federal Highway Administration for a waiver to toll lanes on interstate highways.
“There’s (been) a lot of concerns expressed, particularly around the tolling aspect,” he told his colleagues. “I would remind you that the language related to tolling is all based on the state applying for and receiving a waiver from the federal government, which may never happen.”
Even if that does occur, he noted the State Budget Committee would have to approve any plans before implementation.
The Senate advanced House Bill 1461 on a 38-10 vote.
When legislation goes to conference committee, lawmakers typically hammer out a compromise behind closed doors. If a measure survives that process, it’ll head back to each chamber for a final vote before going to Gov. Mike Braun.

A U.S. Department of Defense inspector general report evaluating the decision on where to house U.S. Space Command headquarters highlights the key points of contention in the selection process and why certain agencies had a preference on where it should be located.
The report found that while Air Force leaders decided Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville was the preferred location for Space Command because of cost efficiency, Space Command leaders argued Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, where the headquarters are currently located, made more sense for operational readiness and civilian workforce retention. The agencies also came to different conclusions around risk assessment and risk mitigation.
Space Command leaders argued that many of the full-time employees in Colorado Springs would not move to Alabama and would leave their positions. Constructing secure operational facilities in Huntsville would take three to four years after the final basing decision was made, the report says.

Space Command’s final location has been a matter of intense debate between Trump’s first term and former President Joe Biden’s term. Colorado officials expressed concern that Trump’s decision to move headquarters to Alabama was politically motivated, because he waited until after the results of the 2020 election to make a decision. Trump won Alabama, but Biden won Colorado. Space Command reached full operational capacity at Peterson Space Force Base by December 2023 after Biden announced at the end of July 2023 it would stay in Colorado Springs.
Then-Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall also did not announce a final location decision after the required environmental review in Huntsville was complete, the inspector general report notes. The report says that the Air Force secretary and the then-secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, were not interviewed by the inspector general, as the White House would not make them available without Department of Defense legal counsel present.
“A final location decision by the (Air Force secretary) would have allowed USSPACECOM to begin the process of relocating to (Redstone Arsenal),” the report says. “However, USSPACECOM continued to accelerate its approach of (full-operational capacity) at its provisional HQ location in Colorado Springs.”

Elected leaders weigh in

The report does not make any conclusions about which location would be a better home for Space Command, though members of Congress on both sides of the issue have claimed the report supports their state as the rightful location.
Colorado Democrats in Congress issued a joint statement saying the report confirms that keeping Space Command in Colorado is in the best interest of national security. That includes U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, and U.S. Reps. Jason Crow of Centennial, Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood.
“Any relocation of U.S. Space Command’s headquarters would threaten our military readiness, cost years of valuable time and resources, and result in an irreversible loss of personnel and expertise,” the statement says. “As our nation’s adversaries are rapidly developing their own space capabilities, we don’t have time to waste. The decision to keep Space Command in Colorado was the right one and will ensure continued operations to safeguard America’s national security.”
U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Saks, claimed soon after President Donald Trump won the 2024 election that the president would relocate Space Command to Alabama. Colorado officials in Congress from both sides of the aisle have opposed that idea.
Colorado’s Republican delegation in Congress wrote to Trump at the start of April urging him to maintain Space Command’s operational readiness in Colorado Springs, citing the area’s already robust space military infrastructure.
Republican U.S. Reps. Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs, Lauren Boebert of Windsor, Jeff Hurd of Grand Junction, and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton issued a joint statement saying the report confirms that losing civilian personnel in Colorado “will significantly impact the full operational capability during a time when our foreign adversaries pose a real risk to our national security. We cannot afford to move backwards during such a critical time.”
“China and Russia have advanced the weaponization of space, and the national debt has increased nearly 30% in the past few years,” the statement says. “Transferring the Command at such a turbulent time would jeopardize our national security, needlessly put American lives at risk, and create an unnecessary waste of taxpayer resources.”
Crank’s district, the 5th Congressional District, is home to Peterson Space Force Base and Space Command.
In a statement, Rogers — who chairs the House Armed Services Committee — said the report confirms the Trump administration was correct in choosing Huntsville to house Space Command and that the report “reveals an astounding lack of transparency and accountability by the Biden Administration.”
“The fact is that the Air Force recommended SPACECOM HQ be built in Huntsville, that any disruption associated with that move could be mitigated, and that moving to Huntsville would save the taxpayer over $420,000,000,” Rogers said in a statement.
U.S. Rep. Dale Strong, R-Madison, whose district includes Huntsville, issued a statement on X saying Biden’s decision to keep Space Command in Colorado was “an attempt to further President Biden’s political agenda.”

,California,2025-04-15 23:19:07+00:00,CalMatters,Sonoma State’s plan to cut more than a dozen majors is on pause,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/04/sonoma-state/,Sonoma State faces a $24 million budget shortfall after a steep drop in enrollment. The school has already shed almost $26 million in expenses.,"In summary
Sonoma State faces a $24 million budget shortfall after a steep drop in enrollment. The school has already shed almost $26 million in expenses.


A judge in Sonoma County has temporarily blocked California State University leaders from cutting academic programs at Sonoma State, for now pausing a plan that was supposed to save the cash-strapped campus tens of millions of dollars.Sonoma County Superior Court Judge Kenneth English issued the temporary restraining order today and set a new hearing for May 1.This is a victory for the seven student-athletes who sued Sonoma State’s interim president and the system chancellor over the campus leadership’s decision in January to terminate more than a dozen majors for the 2025-26 academic year, including philosophy, economics, modern languages and physics. The campus also planned to eliminate the school’s National Collegiate Athletic Association sports teams.
Lawyers for the students argued that Sonoma State didn’t follow system procedures for terminating academic programs. They say the school should have conferred with the Academic Senate, a body of full-time professors that shares governance duties with school administrators on academic matters.“There’s just supposed to be a process of proposing a plan, getting feedback, getting a recommendation from the Academic Senate, in addition to other steps that were not followed,” said Ross Middlemiss, a lawyer for the student-athletes and himself an alumni of Sonoma State and a former soccer player for the school.Sonoma State’s Academic Senate didn’t learn of the proposed cuts until Jan. 22, the day Interim President Emily F. Cutrer publicized her administration’s plans. The suit also argues that Sonoma State leaders didn’t follow its own rules for informing students about changes to their majors. The student body president of the campus only learned 10 minutes before the decision was made public. 
“The lack of consultation with any enrolled students or student leadership not only violated the regulations but also left the student body president without any ability to address the myriad of questions and concerns from confused and angry students,” the suit, which was filed March 7, states. 
Cal State wants cuts to fight budget shortfall
The judge’s ruling today blocked Cal State from ending only academic programs; Middlemiss and the other lawyers wanted the judge to also halt cuts to the sports teams. They’ll make their case at the May 1 hearing and hope to win an injunction, which would further prevent Cal State from going through with its cuts. 
Middlemiss said Cutrer has already asked the sports conference Sonoma State teams are in to drop the teams from future programming. That’s one reason the lawyers are rushing to reverse the cuts. “If they’re removed from the NCAA, the process to get back in is costly and uncertain and time consuming,” Middlemiss said.Sonoma State faces a $24 million budget shortfall after a steep drop in enrollment — from around 9,000 students in 2018 to 5,800 now. The school has shed almost $26 million in expenses, from not rehiring faculty to employing fewer management positions.The proposed cuts are meant to stabilize the school’s budget. Middemiss said he and the other lawyers for the plaintiffs doubt the system’s claims that cutting the sports programs would save the campus nearly $4 million. He said athletics at Sonoma State are budget-neutral and may even generate money. The school’s moves would lead to dozens of layoffs, including professors.
Sonoma State is an extreme example of Cal State’s escalating budget crisis. The 23-campus system has battled several years of budget shortfalls in the hundreds of millions of dollars. It may also lose $375 million in state support — a decline of 8% — if a plan by Gov. Gavin Newsom that state lawmakers signed off on last year goes through this summer. But now legislators are advocating to lessen or completely reverse those planned budget cuts.“I will say, as a Sonoma State alum, as now a fourth-generation Sonoma County resident, it’s not only frustrating, it’s simply unacceptable,” said Sen. Mike McGuire, the leader of the state Senate, at a forum yesterday discussing the future of Sonoma State. He faulted Cal State system leadership for having an inadequate plan to help Sonoma State. “I am done being taken advantage of,” he said yesterday. “It feels like you are trying to run out the clock.”

Kelly Ayotte, President Donald Trump, and legislative and congressional Republicans continue to shape their marketing campaign for selling reductions in critical public services and programs as “reasonable adjustments” to spending, it’s important to keep up with your reading.
If you’re a fan of dark comedy, you should check out an April 14 New York Times dispatch headlined “Republicans Ponder the Unthinkable: Taxing the Rich.”
The premise of the necessarily short piece is that congressional Republicans are so shocked by the degree to which they’ve bamboozled the working class that they’re “quietly” — and antithetically — considering doing them a solid by increasing the tax rate on top individual earners (those above $609,351). 
“For Republicans struggling with the roughly $4 trillion cost of continuing the 2017 cuts,” tax policy reporter Andrew Duehren writes, “letting the top rate snap back to 39.6% (where it stood before Trump cut it to 37% during his first term) would be an easy way to reduce the cost of the bill.”
Rather quickly, the story crumbles under the weight of its unlikelihood, placing it in the same news category as one headlined, “Powerball ticket buyer dreamily considers benefits of taking lump sum over annuity.” The lottery ticket won’t hit and the GOP won’t tax the wealthy, and so the pros-and-cons exercise is meaningless.
It shouldn’t be meaningless, mind you, but it is. Even though the Tax Policy Institute calculates the return to 39.6% would save about $366 billion, the Times story notes, “some Republicans quickly promised to try and kill any tax increases, and leadership was circumspect.”
With Republicans firmly established as the MAGA Party, I wonder where the highest marginal tax rate was set when that crowd last considered America to be “Great.” Was it the 88% of the Greatest Generation years of 1942 and 1943, or the 94% of 1944 and 1945? Probably not. Could it be that when they say “Great Again” they’re actually referring to the years just before and during the Great Depression, when the rate was 25% (and a low of 24% in 1929, the year that brought us Black Thursday)? While I’m sure they love that rate, it’s tough to put a positive spin on an era of global economic collapse, so no. But it’s also clear as day they don’t mean the mythologized golden years of 1951 to 1963, when the rate was steadily 91% (except for the two years, 1952 and 1953, when it was 92%).
“Great Again” has to refer to Trump’s beloved 1980s — the Gordon Gekko “Greed is Good” era. When Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, the top rate was 70%, but by the time he left office after two terms, it was 28%.
How great has Reaganomics worked out for the American working class, you ask? Here’s what a first-ripple 1992 study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found, as reported by the Los Angeles Times on Aug. 28 of that year: “‘In the vast majority of states, economic growth during the 1980s was not shared evenly among the rich, the poor, and the middle class,’ the study concluded. ‘Instead, the wealthy fared substantially better than other income groups.’”
Nearly three decades after that study, a 2020 Pew Research Center report offered a longer view of the kind of economic growth that is “not shared evenly among the rich, the poor, and the middle class”: Since 1980, Pew researchers said, there has been an “uninterrupted increase in inequality” in America.
And, this past October, the Congressional Budget Office reported that as of 2022, “families in the top 10% of the distribution held 60% of all wealth, up from 56% in 1989.” Meanwhile, for the rest of the top half, that percentage fell from 37% to 34%, and the bottom 50% remained steady from 1989 to 2022 — at a shame-of-the-nation 6% (which, without factoring in future Social Security benefits, is actually 3%). 
That’s a lot of numbers, so here’s the flashcard: The top 10% in America holds about two-thirds of all wealth and the bottom 50% holds just (and optimistically) one-twentieth. And, since the beginning of the GOP’s beloved (and still unfolding) Reagan Revolution, the middle class share has been heading in the wrong direction.
If you listen to the Republican Party now — from Ayotte to Trump to legislative and congressional leaders — you won’t hear about this nation’s obscene acceleration of economic inequality since 1980. What you will hear, however, is an abundance of blame placed on those with the least — the undeserving Medicaid and SNAP recipients, the invading migrants, all of the people living with disabilities, various “welfare” fraudsters — for allegedly hollowing out the middle class. That sure sounds like an unbelievable amount of macroeconomic influence for people holding 3 to 6% of national wealth, doesn’t it?
Truly, statistically, commonsensically unbelievable.
Still, Republicans say they’re slashing budgets not to punish the less fortunate, which is inarguably what they are doing in practice, but to eliminate “waste, fraud, and abuse.” And they always say it in that singsongy order (“waste, fraud, and abuse”) because it’s meant to be an earworm marketing jingle rather than factual. You will also hear, from Ayotte, Trump, and Republican leadership, that any proposed Medicaid cuts will not affect “vulnerable” people — and they always use the word “vulnerable.” Why? Because since the November electoral victories they’ve been rewriting, all on their own, the definition of who is considered “vulnerable” so they can more easily sell the punitive as a “reasonable adjustment.”
I wonder: How many more decades of data do we need in order to see who has benefited — and who has not — from the Reagan-era policies exalted and expanded by the modern American right? And, when will it become clear to Granite State voters that New Hampshire Republicans are following — to the letter — a playbook that has resulted in historic levels of economic inequality and all its targeted suffering?
What I’m asking is, what will it take for the 90% who populate “Other America” to realize they’re getting played by the party of the 10%?",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/inequality-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 20:07:20.334851

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A committee of lawmakers on Tuesday endorsed a bill that would allow the state to shift health insurance premium costs onto employees.
Senate Bill 2160, sponsored by Rep. Kyle Davison, R-Fargo, would change the state employee health care plan to comply with the federal Affordable Care Act. This change would be irreversible.
The House Appropriations Committee voted 15-7 to give the bill a do-pass recommendation.
It will soon go to the House floor for a vote by the whole chamber.
 
More 2025 legislative session coverage


Supporters cite two main benefits to the policy. For one, it would cover a greater swath of services for employees — including contraception and preventative procedures like colonoscopies and mammograms.
Under the new plan, co-pays would also apply toward out-of-pocket maximums.
The new plan would cost about $6.6 million to implement for the 2025-2027 budget, according to an analysis attached with the bill. It says it would cost more than $25 million for the 2027-2029 biennium.
One of the more divisive components of the proposal is that it’d give the state the ability to make employees pay a portion of the insurance premiums. Right now, the state covers that cost.
Some said this would allow the state greater flexibility to address rising expenses for medical care.
“We have to start looking at ways to make a change for our budget, because we are not going to have the revenue coming in next time that we’ve had in the past,” said Rep. David Monson, R-Osnabock. “To ask people to kick in a little more out of their pocket, put some more skin in the game, I don’t think that’s unreasonable.”
Critics have said there isn’t enough concrete evidence to suggest the policy change is a good idea.
Molly Herrington, chief people officer of the state’s Office of Management and Budget, submitted testimony last month in opposition to the bill.
She said the state doesn’t have data on how many employees would prefer to change to an Affordable Care Act compliant plan.
“Funding increases for the upcoming biennium are planned to be covered through PERS reserves, but we are concerned with how future costs will be covered long term and the risk that costs would be paid by employees,” Herrington wrote, referring to the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System. “If increased costs are pushed to employees, this would significantly dilute the strength of our total rewards package.”
Her testimony included survey results from 2022 and 2024 that indicate employees consider health insurance the most important benefit offered by the state.

“I think we’re treading down a very treacherous path that we may not fully appreciate with regards to retention and employees,” said Rep. Eric Murphy, R-Grand Forks, who voted against the bill.
North Dakota United, the union that represents public employees, opposes the bill. President Nick Archuleta said the state Legislature should study the issue during the upcoming interim session to field more thorough feedback from state employees about what kind of health insurance they want.
“They should not fear taking the time that it takes to get the information needed to make a good decision,” he said.
Some have testified that they believe the new policy could be a draw for state employees, however.
“We see this bill as, frankly, a retention tool for some of our employees, for the different benefits that are covered that are not covered right now,” Insurance Commissioner Jon Godfread told lawmakers at a previous committee hearing.
In written testimony, Insurance Department Deputy Commissioner John Arnold elaborated that the agency still worries about the long-term impacts of changing the plan. 
“A shift in costs could create an additional financial burden on state employees, ultimately affecting the workforce’s morale, retention, and the state’s ability to attract top talent,” he wrote.
Arnold said the department would support adding an Affordable Care Act plan as an option for employees if it also allowed them to remain on the existing plan.

Phil Murphy says will make commuting a more positive experience this summer. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday commuters should brace for some short-term disruptions to rail service as Amtrak replaces old wires and broken signals in an effort to prevent another summer of delays.
Murphy met with Amtrak officials in Newark to highlight repairs being made to the aging rail infrastructure that moves hundreds of thousands of commuters between New Jersey and New York daily. Murphy said momentary pain is necessary for a “meaningfully better commuter experience.” 
“We can’t bat a thousand on the one hand, but on the other hand, a lot of progress has been made that would have a tangible and specific impact, positively, on the commuter experience going forward,” Murphy said. 
Amtrak, which owns tracks and other infrastructure used by NJ Transit trains on the northeast corridor, the busiest commuter rail line on the continent, has often drawn rebukes from New Jersey elected officials who say the agency does not do enough to prevent delays for NJ Transit customers. 
Officials said Tuesday they plan to get work done before the temperatures rise over the summer, spikes that are often blamed for service delays and cancellations. 
“This is as far from a blame game as you can imagine right now,” Murphy said. “Facts are facts, but this is the spirit of coming up with a better customer and commuter experience, as good an experience as possible.” 
Kris Kolluri, CEO and president of NJ Transit, said customers will be told about the service changes up to four weeks in advance. Kolluri said a list of outages will be published by the first week in June, “well in advance, so our customers will know.” 
Officials said they plan to replace overhead wires that can become tangled and cause train delays, increase inspections, add crews to respond to problems, and message customers more frequently about delays and cancellations.
The ongoing work is part of a broader plan to address the region’s aging rail infrastructure and as the state prepares to host the first FIFA Club World Cup this summer and the World Cup next summer.
Last summer marked the second-worst summer for NJ Transit under Murphy’s administration, with more than 1,800 trains canceled (the worst was in 2020, when a tropical storm stopped trains on multiple rail lines for several days).

Bob Ferguson’s office debated plans earlier this year to send 200 National Guard troops to the Canadian border to assist with the Trump administration’s attempts to stop drug trafficking.
Ferguson ultimately decided not to pursue the plan. 
But Washington military officials went so far as to draft a letter on the governor’s behalf pitching the idea and commending President Donald Trump for his “continued efforts to combat the flow of illegal narcotics through the northern border.”
While the letter was never sent, the episode offers a window into how the new governor’s administration was trying to strike a balance working with a president whom Ferguson himself has sparred with repeatedly and who is deeply unpopular in much of Washington state.
The Standard obtained the letter — addressed to Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — through a public records request. 
Ferguson’s communications director, Brionna Aho, said this week that Ferguson did not request the letter and did not write it himself, even though it was drafted as though it were from him.
She said the letter was rooted in discussions between the governor’s office and the Washington Military Department about the potential for Trump to federalize the state’s National Guard. 
State Adjutant General Gent Welsh raised this possibility based on conversations with federal officials and media reports, Aho said. 
As adjutant general, Welsh commands the state’s National Guard, directs the Washington Military Department and serves as the governor’s homeland security advisor.
In early February, Welsh reached out to Ferguson’s chief operations officer, Shane Esquibel, to raise the issue. To avoid federal activation, the governor could deploy the state’s National Guard “for a defined mission that is consistent with Washington’s values,” Aho said.
On Feb. 7, Ferguson’s top advisors met with officials from the Military Department, which drafted the letter ahead of the meeting to discuss. 
Esquibel, now the governor’s interim chief of staff, briefed Ferguson on the proposal, but the governor decided against it, according to Aho.
“As you can imagine, many ideas are presented to the governor,” Aho said in an email. “The governor does not take action on all of them. This is one example.”
‘Ready to support’
The draft letter says “Washington is fully committed to partnering with the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense to confront” traffickers moving fentanyl and other illegal drugs.
The National Guard troops would have been ordered to “help with communications center support, analysis, transportation and construction, or any other mission deemed appropriate for DoD support,” so border patrol agents could focus on enforcement. 
Ferguson would have deployed the troops under Title 32 502(f) orders, meaning they would be under the governor’s control while the federal government foots the bill. Such orders are rare in Washington. 
The last Title 32 502(f) order was during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Karina Shagren, a spokesperson for the Washington Military Department. 
And the last time Washington’s National Guard troops were sent specifically to the state’s northern border was in the early 2000s, Shagren said. In that case, the president federalized the troops under Title 10, meaning the federal government controls their orders.
The letter also notes Washington stands “ready to support the Canada-U.S. Joint Strike Force,” a new partnership that aims to combat transnational drug trafficking, money laundering and other organized crime. “I am prepared to allocate any necessary resources to ensure its success,” it says.
Ferguson has championed a bill in the state Legislature to give him the authority to stop National Guard troops from other states from deploying in Washington. House Bill 1321 has passed both chambers and now awaits the governor’s signature.
‘Where we can’
The Canadian border has been a flashpoint in the opening months of the second Trump presidency, with relations between the two allies souring and repeated calls from the president to make the neighboring country the 51st U.S. state.
Trump kicked off his term with the threat of tariffs to get Canada to boost border security and stop drugs from crossing into the United States. After former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in February committed more resources to fentanyl trafficking enforcement, Trump briefly called off the import taxes.
During his gubernatorial campaign last year, Ferguson committed to convening a statewide “crisis response unit” focused on the fentanyl crisis and called for boosting state funding for drug task forces.
In his Jan. 15 inaugural address, the governor pledged to work with the president “where we can,” while also saying, “We will stand up to him when we must.”
Almost immediately after Trump took office, less than a week after Ferguson was sworn in, new tensions began to build between the state and the president. 
As attorney general, Ferguson sued the Trump administration dozens of times during Trump’s first term. The state is now involved in 11 lawsuits against the second Trump administration, brought by Attorney General Nick Brown over everything from federal funding freezes to efforts to restrict birthright citizenship.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/canadian-border-crossing-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 20:07:20.334851

Mike Dunleavy vetoed five bills, citing the fact that the Alaska Legislature passed them after the constitutional end of the legislative session.
So far in 2025, four of those five bills have been reapproved by either the House or Senate.
On Friday, the Alaska House of Representatives voted 37-0 to remove a requirement that fishing vessels register with the state Department of Motor Vehicles if they’re already registered with the U.S. Coast Guard and Alaska Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission.
That removal will become law if the Senate and Gov. Mike Dunleavy also approve House Bill 31, which contains the removal and was the fourth of the five bills vetoed last year because of the missed deadline.
The bill was sponsored by Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, in both years.
Of the remaining missed-deadline bills, the Legislature has already passed two: one that allows state borrowing for a cruise ship dock in Seward, and another that allows teens to serve alcohol at restaurants, lodges and similar establishments. Senate Bill 15 is awaiting the governor’s action.
The Senate — but not the House — has passed a bill allowing employers to pay employees via “payroll cards.”
The last of the vetoed-and-reintroduced bills, which would have banned insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher rates to elected officials, has not received a hearing.

(Department of Defense Inspector General)A U.S. Department of Defense inspector general report evaluating the decision on where to house U.S. Space Command headquarters highlights the key points of contention in the selection process and why certain agencies had a preference on where it should be located. 
The report found that while Air Force leaders decided Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, was the preferred location for Space Command because of cost efficiency, Space Command leaders argued Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, where the headquarters are currently located, made more sense for operational readiness and civilian workforce retention. The agencies also came to different conclusions around risk assessment and risk mitigation. 
Space Command leaders argued that many of the full-time employees in Colorado Springs would not move to Alabama and would leave their positions. Constructing secure operational facilities in Huntsville would take three to four years after the final basing decision was made, the report says. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Space Command’s final location has been a matter of intense debate between Trump’s first term and former President Joe Biden’s term. Colorado officials expressed concern that Trump’s decision to move headquarters to Alabama was politically motivated, because he waited until after the results of the 2020 election to make a decision. Trump won Alabama, but Biden won Colorado. Space Command reached full operational capacity at Peterson Space Force Base by December 2023 after Biden announced at the end of July 2023 it would stay in Colorado Springs.
Then-Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall also did not announce a final location decision after the required environmental review in Huntsville was complete, the inspector general report notes. The report says that the Air Force secretary and the then-secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, were not interviewed by the inspector general, as the White House would not make them available without Department of Defense legal counsel present. 
“A final location decision by the (Air Force secretary) would have allowed USSPACECOM to begin the process of relocating to (Redstone Arsenal),” the report says. “However, USSPACECOM continued to accelerate its approach of (full-operational capacity) at its provisional HQ location in Colorado Springs.”
Elected leaders weigh in
The report does not make any conclusions about which location would be a better home for Space Command, though members of Congress on both sides of the issue have claimed the report supports their state as the rightful location. 
Colorado Democrats in Congress issued a joint statement saying the report confirms that keeping Space Command in Colorado is in the best interest of national security. That includes U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, and U.S. Reps. Jason Crow of Centennial, Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood.
“Any relocation of U.S. Space Command’s headquarters would threaten our military readiness, cost years of valuable time and resources, and result in an irreversible loss of personnel and expertise,” the statement says. “As our nation’s adversaries are rapidly developing their own space capabilities, we don’t have time to waste. The decision to keep Space Command in Colorado was the right one and will ensure continued operations to safeguard America’s national security.”
U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican, claimed soon after President Donald Trump won the 2024 election that the president would relocate Space Command to Alabama. Colorado officials in Congress from both sides of the aisle have opposed that idea.
Colorado’s Republican delegation in Congress wrote to Trump at the start of April urging him to maintain Space Command’s operational readiness in Colorado Springs, citing the area’s already robust space military infrastructure. 
Republican U.S. Reps. Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs, Lauren Boebert of Windsor, Jeff Hurd of Grand Junction, and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton issued a joint statement saying the report confirms that losing civilian personnel in Colorado “will significantly impact the full operational capability during a time when our foreign adversaries pose a real risk to our national security. We cannot afford to move backwards during such a critical time.”
“China and Russia have advanced the weaponization of space, and the national debt has increased nearly 30% in the past few years,” the statement says. “Transferring the Command at such a turbulent time would jeopardize our national security, needlessly put American lives at risk, and create an unnecessary waste of taxpayer resources.”
Crank’s district, the 5th Congressional District, is home to Peterson Space Force Base and Space Command.
In a statement, Rogers — who chairs the House Armed Services Committee — said the report confirms the Trump administration was correct in choosing Huntsville to house Space Command and that the report “reveals an astounding lack of transparency and accountability by the Biden Administration.”
“The fact is that the Air Force recommended SPACECOM HQ be built in Huntsville, that any disruption associated with that move could be mitigated, and that moving to Huntsville would save the taxpayer over $420,000,000,” Rogers said in a statement. 
U.S. Rep. Dale Strong, also an Alabama Republican, issued a statement on X saying Biden’s decision to keep Space Command in Colorado was “an attempt to further President Biden’s political agenda.”

After four hours of floor debate, the House passed the proposed amendment with 94 in favor and 50 against. Two Republicans — Speaker Jon Patterson and state Rep. Bill Allen — joined with 48 Democrats in opposition. 
As lawmakers prepared to vote, protesters with Abortion Action Missouri began chanting from the upper chamber, unfurling banners over the balcony protesting the proposed amendment. 
“When abortion rights are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back,” they shouted before security moved them into the hallway. 
 Protestors with Abortion Action Missouri interrupt Missouri House debate of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment Tuesday, chanting: “When abortion rights are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back” (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The legislation needs to be approved one more time by the House before it goes to the Senate. 
If approved by the Senate, and then by voters, the new amendment would reinstate a near-total abortion ban in Missouri with limited exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation.  
It would also protect women’s access to health care during miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, and other medical emergencies. These protections are also in place under the current law.
In November, voters approved Amendment 3, which rolled back Missouri’s abortion ban and opened the door for clinics to begin performing the procedure for the first time since 2022. 
The proposed constitutional amendment debated Tuesday was filed by Republican state Rep. Ed Lewis of Moberly and is being carried by state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican. A previous proposed abortion ban was scrapped before making it to the full House, causing some to speculate about internal disagreements among GOP lawmakers causing roadblocks with a month left in the legislative session.
Seitz denies that there are any disagreements between GOP lawmakers, saying the current legislation before the House was the plan all along because it best matches with the language in a similar Senate proposal.
“We’re on the exact same sheet of music,” he said. “The timeline may appear long to the general public, but this is exactly the plan from the beginning.” 
Seitz insists that Missourians, in approving Amendment 3 with just shy of 52% of the statewide vote, were signaling that some exceptions were needed in Missouri’s prior abortion ban.
 State Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican from Branson, debates a proposed constitutional amendment banning abortion on Tuesday (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Since abortion was legalized late last year, Missouri Republicans have made it a priority to undo or weaken the current law, forcing many lawmakers to contend with their beliefs around abortion exceptions, something many have opposed in the past.
“I make decisions from a Biblical worldview,” Seitz told The Independent last week. “I have to understand that others may not, so pragmatically, how do we, particularly we that profess Christ as savior, how do we justify even the possibility of these exceptions for rape and incest?” 
His conclusion: Exceptions will still allow the GOP legislature to “save as many infants as possible and protect women.” 
During a marathon House debate on Tuesday, however, Democrats dismissed that argument. 
“You think you’re stopping abortions with these ridiculous bills? You’re not,” said state Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson.  “You’re stopping safe, legal abortions. People are still going to have abortions. So if you want to be pro-life, let’s try being pro quality-of-life first.”
Proudie noted that at a House committee hearing, some lawmakers advocated murder charges for rape and incest survivors who seek out abortions. 
She was among several Democrats who shared stories of constituents who weren’t allowed to testify against the bill last week when state Rep. Holly Jones, who chairs the House Committee on Children and Families, limited testimony to only nine people, despite dozens more traveling to Jefferson City to oppose the legislation.
“My vagina is not mine,” Proudie said. “It belongs to the state of Missouri.”
 State Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, debates a proposed constitutional amendment banning abortion on Tuesday (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
If approved by both the House and Senate, Missourians could be asked to weigh in on reinstating an abortion ban as soon as a special election the governor could call this year, or during the 2026 midterm election. 
The proposed ballot summary doesn’t mention banning elective abortions. Instead, Missourians would be asked if they want to amend the Missouri constitution to: 

“Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; 
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and 
Protect children from gender transition?”

Missouri state Rep. Mark Boyko, a Democrat from Kirkwood, said that no part of the ballot language “tells a voter that there will be fewer abortions allowed.”
Previous iterations of this proposed amendment included exceptions for survivors, but only if they first reported the rape or incest to police, a requirement that was highly criticized as dangerous by survivors and advocates. 
While the current version eliminated those requirements, House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, remained skeptical of how survivors would be allowed to access the procedure. 
“Who is the arbiter of whether or not she was raped or a victim of incest?” asked Aune, who is herself a survivor. “The honor system?” 
After the passage of Amendment 3 in November, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state, claiming that many of the TRAP laws on the books were rendered unconstitutional. A Jackson County judge agreed, striking down many of the current regulations as “discriminatory.” 
This decision allowed Planned Parenthood to again begin offering some procedural abortions at three of its clinics. Medication abortions, however, remain inaccessible. 
Jones said Amendment 3 was vague and “completely up to judicial interpretation” with unintended consequence. 
 State Rep. Holly Jones, a Republican from Eureka, debates a proposed constitutional amendment banning abortion on Tuesday (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
State Rep. Cathy Jo Loy, a Republican from Carthage, pointed to language in Amendment 3 referring to a “treating health care professional.”
Could that include a dietician or a speech pathologist, Jo Loy asked. 
“Absolutely,” Seitz replied.
State Rep. Jeremy Dean, a Democrat from Springfield who worked in health care for five years, including at an OBGYN office, disputed this. 
“You ever heard of scope of practice? You ever heard of a licensure? A governing body?” he said. Those are all things that exist that didn’t go away when Amendment 3 passed.” 
The proposed amendment also looks to require that any legal challenges to the state law around reproductive health care be heard in Cole County, a nod to the ongoing legal battle playing out between the state and Planned Parenthood in Jackson County.
Republican lawmakers on numerous occasions during Tuesday’s debate emphasized that the main goal of the amendment was to protect women.
“I ask that you stop trying to protect me or my constituents,” said state Rep. Jo Doll, a Democrat from St. Louis. “Because we can protect ourselves.” 
State Rep. Becky Laubinger, a Republican from Park Hills, rejected any accusations that anti-abortion lawmakers don’t care about women. 
Laubinger, who runs Monarch Family Resource Center in Ironton, said she’s gone out at all hours of the day to purchase diapers and pack n plays for families in need. She’s watched children so women could go to doctor’s appointments. 
Democrats ultimately accused their GOP colleagues of attempting to undermine the will of the people.
“Sending this back to them is not a democratic exercise,” said state Rep. Eric Woods, a Democrat from Kansas City. “It’s an attempt to slap them on the wrist, tell them they were wrong and maybe they can do it better next time.”

Kelly Kortum, D-Bozeman, told his colleagues during a committee hearing last month that he wanted to solve a common problem for Montana renters.
“When folks apply to an apartment, a certain apartment might get 20 applications. The second person might get the apartment, (but) 18 application fees might go into the pocket of the property manager,” Kortum told the Senate Business, Labor, and Economic Affairs Committee. 
His bill, House Bill 311, would require property managers to refund application fees to prospective renters who are not selected for an apartment or home. 
Kortum said his bill would fix bad business practices and protect consumers, especially workers and college students.
HB 311 passed a final vote in the Legislature on Tuesday, and is on its way to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk for a signature or veto. 
The bill drew bipartisan support in both chambers, but had a rough start in the House, where lawmakers in the House Judiciary Committee tabled the legislation. Opposition to the bill, stemming mainly from the Montana Landlords Association and Montana Association of Realtors, had expressed concerns that the law would be put into the wrong section of code, and would target small property managers or individual landlords who would have to take extra steps to return fees. 
Proponents included the Associated Students of the University of Montana, the Montana Budget and Policy Center, and Joey Morrison, Deputy Mayor of Bozeman. They argued the bill was part of the affordable housing fix by helping to stabilize low-cost housing and keeping students and workers in the towns they live and work in. 
“Every day, Montanans pay rental application fees but don’t get the apartment,” Kortum said during the committee hearing. “Why are they paying for a service they never receive?”
A successful blast motion on the House floor — wherein the entire body votes to override a committee action — brought the debate to chamber.
“Last spring, I found myself in this position. I spent nearly $1,000 in six weeks applying for rentals here in Helena,” said Rep. Julie Darling, R-Helena. “I don’t have a thousand extra dollars — and I have a really good job — I don’t know how somebody else making minimum wage does this.”
The bill passed 63-31, with 26 Republicans joining all Democrats. 
In the Senate, Business and Labor committee amended the bill, following discussions with Kortum and some opponents, to change where the bill would be put into Montana Code Annotated, adding it to a section where property managers are regulated. The committee also amended the bill to target property managers who oversee four or more properties, exempting individual landlords and small management companies. 
The Senate approved the bill with bipartisan support 32-14. 
Kortum brought a similar bill during the 2023 session and in 2021 a Bozeman senator also proposed an application refund law, but neither garnered much support. 
Democrat leaders in the Legislature praised the bill’s passage on Tuesday and urged the governor to sign it into law. 
“Getting a roof over your head should not be a raffle or a lottery. HB 311 would end the housing lottery and stop landlords from harvesting exploitative fees from hardworking Montanans,” House Minority Leader Rep. Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, said in a press release. “If signed, Democrats’ HB 311 would be one of the most significant policies enacted for renters in the last four years.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1347257020-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 19:08:59.029137

Quinn Hurt/Department of Defense)The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the U.S. Department of Defense over what it calls a sweeping campaign of censorship in public schools run for military families, including one in Virginia, accusing federal officials of banning books and curricula related to race, gender and civil rights in violation of students’ First Amendment rights.
In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, the ACLU National, the ACLU of Kentucky, and the ACLU of Virginia allege that the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) and Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth have systematically stripped school libraries and classrooms of age-appropriate, award-winning materials. 
These include canonical works about slavery, the civil rights movement, gender identity, and sexual orientation, which were removed following a series of executive orders issued by President Donald Trump earlier this year.
The complaint, filed on behalf of eleven students at DoDEA schools around the world — including two at Crossroads Elementary in Quantico, Virginia — claims these actions have “irreparably harmed” children by denying them access to essential knowledge and perspectives, solely on the basis of “disfavored” political viewpoints.
“The Department of Defense Education Activity is quarantining library books and whitewashing curricula in its civilian schools,” the suit states. “With no regard to how canonical, award-winning, or age-appropriate the material, DoDEA today is scrubbing references to race and gender from its libraries and lessons.”
As of now, the Department of Defense has not responded to the lawsuit. 
The erasure campaign, according to the ACLU, stems directly from a trio of Trump administration executive orders — EOs 14168, 14185, and 14190 — aimed at purging “gender ideology,” “divisive concepts,” and DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) programming from all federal agencies, including the military school system. DoDEA operates 161 schools in the U.S. and overseas, serving more than 67,000 children of military and civilian Defense Department personnel.
While DoDEA says the effort is about safeguarding children from “radical indoctrination,” the plaintiffs argue the opposite is true and that students are being denied the opportunity to learn about foundational elements of American history and society. 
“Learning is a sacred and foundational right that is now being limited for students in DoDEA schools,” said Natalie Tolley, a plaintiff on behalf of her three children. 
“The implementation of these EOs, without any due process or parental or professional input, is a violation of our children’s right to access information that prevents them from learning about their own histories, bodies, and identities,” Tolley said. 
“I have three daughters, and they, like all children, deserve access to books that both mirror their own life experiences and that act as windows that expose them to greater diversity. The administration has now made that verboten in DoDEA schools.” 
In many schools, they say, books were pulled without notice and cultural events like Black History Month and Women’s History Month were abruptly canceled.
Emerson Sykes, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, emphasized that students in Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools are entitled to the same constitutional protections as any other young people — regardless of their families’ military ties. “Students in DoDEA schools, though they are members of military families, have the same First Amendment rights as all students,” he said.
Sykes described the current censorship push as particularly offensive, given the diversity and academic excellence of the DoDEA system. 
“Like everyone else, they deserve classrooms where they are free to read, speak, and learn about themselves, their neighbors, and the world around them,” he said, adding that removing books and lessons that reflect the experiences of women, LGBTQ people, and people of color serves only a narrow political agenda. “Our clients deserve better,” Sykes said, “and the First Amendment demands it.”
The suit includes detailed examples of books removed from shelves, including “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “Fahrenheit 451,” “The Kite Runner,” “Well-Read Black Girl,” and “Julian is a Mermaid.” At least one AP Psychology course dropped an entire unit on gender and sexuality. In some cases, parents say they repeatedly requested a list of banned titles but were stonewalled by administrators.
In one particularly revealing memo cited in the complaint, DoDEA officials instructed librarians to remove any books related to “gender ideology” or “discriminatory equity ideology” from student sections and place them into staff-only “professional collections” for further review. 
The result, plaintiffs say, has been a chilling and confusing environment for both students and educators.
“Students’ limited access to disfavored viewpoints will lead to a reduction in diversity of thought and critical thinking skills,” the lawsuit contends. “Defendants’ actions are impairing the ability of students to seek out independent research or self-study opportunities in school libraries.”
The ACLU argues that DoDEA’s censorship campaign violates legal precedent, particularly the Supreme Court’s landmark 1982 decision in Island Trees School District v. Pico, which held that school officials cannot remove books from libraries simply because they disagree with their ideas.
“The First Amendment protects both the right to speak and the right to receive information,” the complaint says. “Defendants’ conduct infringes on students’ right to receive information from DoDEA school books and libraries, free from partisan, political censorship.”
The lawsuit seeks both declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to block the implementation of the executive orders as applied to public education, restore removed books and lesson materials, and affirm students’ constitutional rights to access ideas and information.
If successful, the case could reshape how federal agencies implement education policy, especially in schools where military and civilian communities intersect, and where the children of public servants are now at the center of a nationwide debate over who controls classroom content.

(Getty Images)A movement to invite counties from Illinois trying to secede from their state passed the Senate on Tuesday, with the Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission getting a nod from 36 senators. 
Three Republicans joined all ten Democrats to oppose the move, debating the motion for just over 30 minutes. 
“We all have our own opinions of how good things are here in Indiana, but folks from outside Indiana are eyeballing us,” said sponsor Sen. Scott Baldwin, R-Noblesville. “… we’re just signaling to those Illinois counties that Indiana is open for business and we’d be happy to accept them.”
‘We’d love to have you’: Illinois secession bill earns Indiana House approval

Thirty-three counties have passed an “advisory referenda” signaling their desire to leave Illinois, with seven voting in the most recent November election. In a February committee meeting, some residents said they didn’t feel represented by the state and, specifically, Chicago.
The boundary commission would likely be a “generational conversation,” Baldwin acknowledged, and specifics like the impact on the state’s Medicaid rolls or child care shortage were yet to be ironed out. 
Sen. Fady Qaddoura also noted that some Indiana counties might be interested in leaving the state to join neighbors like Illinois, Michigan or Ohio, all of which have legalized marijuana for recreational use. 
“Believe it or not, many of our constituents think this is a joke. They seriously think the General Assembly has more important policies to deal with, rather than sending political signals,” said Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis. “I’m proud of Indiana. I’m proud to be a resident of Indiana. I’m a proud legislator … I want my focus to continue to be that, not sending political messages to other states.”
Qaddoura’s colleague, Sen. Shelli Yoder of Bloomington, went even further and called the proposal “a political stunt.” She noted that Indiana doesn’t allow for citizens to approach law-making through a referendum — which is what Illinois residents used in their succession vote. 
A seemingly exasperated Sen. Aaron Freeman emphasized that the bill would just approve a commission, not a final boundary agreement. 
“If the fine people of eastern Illinois want to come here? Great,” said the Indianapolis Republican. “But don’t come up here and talk to me about things that have nothing to do with this bill for political purposes.”
Previously, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, said such a move was “not going to happen.”
Due to committee amendments concerning commission membership, the House needs to accept the changes before the bill can become law.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)In a surprise agenda change for Wednesday’s meeting, the Louisiana Public Service Commission will consider terminating a statewide energy efficiency program it just recently hired a contractor to run after spending 14 years to create it.
Commissioner Mike Francis, R-Crowley, added the agenda item Monday, two days before the LPSC meets at the Cypress Bend Resort in Many. Most of the commission’s monthly meetings are held at its headquarters in Baton Rouge, but members periodically schedule hearings in different parts of the state.
“Commissioner Francis’ decision to bring this vote with virtually no notice leaves little time for public input on an issue that directly impacts household budgets and statewide energy policy,” the Alliance for Affordable Energy said in a statement issued Tuesday. The proposal would end all energy efficiency programs in the state, except for municipal-owned utilities that don’t fall under the LPSC’s jurisdiction.
The Alliance noted that residential electricity rates in Louisiana have increased roughly 45% since 2018, stressing the need for a greater emphasis on efficiency programs.
“This is the only program the commission has to help residents manage rising bills,” the group’s news release said.
In January 2024, the LPSC voted 3-2 on energy efficiency resources standards (EERC) that a consultant had worked on for over a decade at a cost of more than a half-million dollars. The policy requires utilities under the commission’s jurisdiction — such as Entergy, Cleco and Swepco — to meet certain energy savings targets each year. 
For example, they can meet the standards through customer-focused upgrades such as adding new insulation to buildings or replacing inefficient heating and cooling systems.
The utilities pay for it with little-noticed energy efficiency fees they’ve charged customers for years. Entergy Louisiana customers can find those fees on their monthly statements billed as “Rider EECR-QS” and “Rider EECR-PE.” 
Louisiana ushers in new energy efficiency policy with an uproar

The energy efficiency program used in Louisiana for the past decade was voluntary, and utility companies managed them with their own staff. Energy efficiency presents a dilemma for utilities because they lead to customers using less of their product, an inherent conflict of interest for companies that profit from the sale of electricity or natural gas. 
The program adopted in 2024 is mandatory and uses a third-party administrator to manage and hold the utilities to the energy savings targets. The LPSC recently hired two companies, Aptim and TetraTech, to provide those services.
Francis is proposing to terminate those contracts and establish a different energy efficiency policy. In a phone interview Tuesday, he said the current policy framework is too complex and believes it will cost too much money. 
“You need a lawyer and a CPA to work through all of this,” Francis said. “It’s pretty complicated.”
Francis initially opposed adopting the program in 2024 alongside Commissioner Eric Skrmetta, R-Metairie. Former Commissioner Craig Greene, R-Baton Rouge, provided the swing vote that passed the measure, which had support from the LPSC’s two Democrats, Foster Campbell of Bossier City and Davanté Lewis of Baton Rouge. 
Debate on the matter at that time attracted ratepayers who filled the meeting room and chanted, demanding commissioners vote on the new program after hours of discussion. That memory wasn’t lost on Francis, who admitted his latest proposal might not be popular with some members of the public.
“I’m probably making some enemies doing this,” he said.
Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan, R-Lafayette, who now sits on the commission in place of Greene, will likely be the deciding vote Wednesday. 
“Sounds like there are several ideas being bandied about regarding the program,” Coussan said, offering few clues about how he intends to vote. “I’m anxious to hear more about the proposals.” 
The program is the first of its kind in the Southeast run by a third-party administrator. 
It “is especially important when it comes to both environmental protection and electricity system affordability,” said Joshua A. Basseches, an assistant professor of environmental studies and public policy at Tulane University. “Scrapping it now would not only be bad public policy, but would also set a bad precedent in terms of process.”

(Photo courtesy of New Mexico Aging Services)Kinship caregivers in approximately half a dozen counties will be part of a new pilot program expected to start this summer designed to help support older New Mexicans and other relatives who take over raising children when parents are unable to do so.
That program is a result of House Bill 252, which establishes the Kinship Caregiver Support Pilot program, signed last week by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
Joey Long, a spokesperson for the Aging and Long-Term Services Department, told Source NM that the department does not anticipate services starting before the beginning of the next fiscal year, which begins in July. The process will also include a 30-day public comment period.
According to the Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation, about 36,000 New Mexico children were raised by grandparents or other next of kin in 2023 – an increase from about 30,000 in 2017.
The bill states that the pilot program will be established in five to seven counties in the state with 50 participants chosen in each county. A previous version of the bill identified Rio Arriba, Santa Fe, Taos, McKinley and Doña Ana counties as communities participating in the program, but the specific counties were struck from the final version of the bill.
Long told Source in a written statement that the department is “assessing geographic areas based on data, stakeholder consultations, and availability of private funding to support participant stipends, as well as other considerations” before choosing communities to participate.
Program participants will eventually be connected to case management assistance, legal assistance, mental health support and respite care.
“Too often kinship caregivers—especially grandparents—are left to navigate complex systems alone while providing childcare,” Kaltenbach said in a statement. “This pilot program will help us establish more resources to help keep families together and ensure caregivers have the support they need to provide the best care possible.”
The program is a three-year pilot, meaning the state will evaluate the outcomes of all participants to help create a possible statewide program in future years. An annual report with outcomes and recommendations is due each December to the Legislative Finance Committee.

Mike Braun's desk.,"Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle, addresses a crowd on Dec. 18, 2024 in Indianapolis. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Contentious regulations for marijuana-like products advanced through the Indiana House of Representatives on Tuesday, but will have to survive closed-door negotiations before crossing Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.
“I filed a dissent,” Sen. Travis Holdman, the measure’s author, told the Capital Chronicle.
“We’ve got some clean-up to do,” the Markle Republican said. “… We’ll be working on it.”
Products with legally low concentrations of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol have proliferated in Indiana, alongside those containing delta-8 THC and other isomers. Attempts to regulate the nascent industry, which is booming on shaky legal footing, have failed repeatedly — but are nearing law, in the form of Senate Bill 478.
Delta-8 regulatory qualms go unaddressed as Indiana House approves homelessness, DEI measures

“These products, being legal under federal law, but having no regulatory structure here in the state, means that technically, it’s not illegal to sell these products to minors (or) to target youth with advertising or packaging, and that there’s no testing requirements to protect consumers from potentially dangerous adulterants,” said Rep. Jake Teshka, the House sponsor, on the chamber’s floor Tuesday.
The measure sets out advertising, age-limit, licensing, packaging, testing and other requirements over the currently unregulated substances. It authorizes the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission to oversee the industry, including approving up to 20,000 retail permits.
Lawmakers have put it through a whopping seven rounds of edits. But critics — including Indiana’s attorney general and anti-marijuana groups — still have objected, arguing the language would expand existing loopholes.
“With Senate Bill 478, I think we finally have an opportunity to rein in this market,” Teshka, R-North Liberty, said. “We have the opportunity to provide real clarity to law enforcement, to protect Hoosier youth, to empower our farmers and to protect our consumers.”
Members of Teshka’s own caucus remained skeptical.
“I recognize that … the General Assembly should take action on the current state of this product,” said Rep. Tim Wesco, R-Osceola. “… (But) I don’t feel like this is the appropriate action.”
Instead, it’s “moving us further down a path of increasing — dramatically increasing — access to these products that are known to have adverse and negative effects,” Wesco continued. “… We’re setting up a framework that we’re likely not going to go back on, that is just going to expand from here.”
Lawmakers from both parties crossed sides in the 60-37 vote.
The bill next heads to conference committee for negotiations. Conferees will hammer out a compromise. If it survives that process, it’ll head back to each chamber for a final vote before going to Braun.

Meanwhile, in the Florida Senate, that chamber’s version (SB 700) was debated on Tuesday and will go for a floor vote later this week, as well.
The omnibus proposal contains a multitude of provisions, including preventing public water systems from using additives like fluoride. At least 22 Florida communities have stopped fluoridating drinking water since November, after state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo issued guidance against the dental health practice.
In the House Commerce Committee on Tuesday to debate the measure (HB 651), Bailey Kuykendoll, operations director for Stand for Health Freedom, told the committee that her organization strongly supports the legislation because of the fluoride provision.
“Water fluoridation is a form of medical treatment,” she said. “It’s recognized as such by the FDA for addressing tooth decay. Most city commissioners and councilors are not doctors and should not be in a position to be prescribing treatment, especially when there’s no way to opt out.”
Miami-Dade County was one of the latest (and biggest) counties to attempt to ban fluoride in the past week, but Mayor Daniella Levine Cava vetoed the measure on Friday.
In the Florida Senate, Democrats filed amendments regarding the fluoride provision. One by South Florida Democrat Lori Berman would have given the power to regulate fluoride back to local governments — contradicting what the bill calls for.
Fellow South Florida Democrat Tina Polsky said there was no reason to do anything on fluoride, and questioned what was motivating the bill sponsor, Central Florida Sen. Keith Truenow?
“What has happened, besides it being the conspiracy theory du jour?” she said. “It’s time to stick with the science. Stick with what’s been working and not upend our whole health system based on unproven theories.”
Another amendment by Polsky would have required the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA) to study the effects of water fluoridation in communities that have elected to fluoridate their water system and send that report to the governor, House speaker and Senate president.
Both amendments failed.
Meat vs. “meat”
The measure would also bar plant-based products from using “milk” and “meat” and “egg” labels. That prompted Orlando Democratic Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith to pose questions to Truenow.
“Are we saying that by labeling ‘oat milk’ that the manufacturers of that product are being untruthful and suggesting that this is milk that comes from a cow and not from oats?” he asked Truenow.
“I didn’t know that you could milk oats,” Truenow replied, making Smith laugh. “If you’re going to call that beverage or that material milk, then it should be coming from a cow or a goat or some other lactating animal.”
Another provision would change the number of extra days to issue a permit to carry a concealed gun if a background check reveals a potentially disqualifying criminal history
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) now has 90 days to issue or deny concealed carry permits and can suspend the process if a law enforcement agency or court notifies the department that the applicant has been arrested or charged with crimes relating to domestic violence, drugs, and other violence.
If the screening identifies information related to a crime that may disqualify the applicant, but does not contain the final disposition of the crime or lacks sufficient information to make an eligibility determination, the House bill says that FDACS would have an additional 45 days to review.
The bill originally called for an additional 90 days, but the compromise brought along Second Amendment supporters who had earlier criticized the measure.
ESG
Another part of the extensive legislation would establish that financial institutions “may not discriminate in the provision of financial services to an agriculture producer based, in whole or in part, upon an ESG factor.”
“ESG” stands for environmental, social, and governance. It’s a framework used to assess a company’s non-financial performance and sustainability practices, but the Florida Legislature has already passed a major bill in the 2023 session that prohibits and seeks to punish any consideration of these factors in the state’s investment decisions.
In the House committee, the Florida Bankers Association’s Anthony DiMarco said that with that legislation already enacted, there is no reason to include this provision. He said that the measure would encourage more lawsuits in the state. “We haven’t been told any real reason why this needs to be changed,” he said. 
Seminole County Republican Rep. David Smith said that while he supported the House bill, he didn’t like that “there’s aspects of the bill that I don’t like. I know I hear from my constituents that they don’t like these bills which have been so jam-packed  and so off-topic.”
“If you live in Florida, there’s no way that you can’t support agriculture,” added Broward County Democratic Rep. Christine Hunschofsky. “Unfortunately, this bill isn’t just about agriculture.”
The measure passed easily in the committee, with only Hunschofsky and fellow Democrats Felicia Robinson from South Florida and Leonard Spencer from Central Florida voting no. The measure now goes to the full House for a vote.
The Senate will also vote on its final version of the bill later this week.

Brad Little gives a press conference after delivering his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, in the Lincoln Auditorium in the Idaho Capitol. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho will try to ban a food assistance program from covering candy and soda.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law House Bill 109, which requires the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to seek federal approval to exclude candy and soda from foods eligible for coverage by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Idaho’s bill is part of the national movement known as “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, promoted by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the bill’s cosponsor Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene has told lawmakers.
“Idaho welcomes the MAHA movement. It is all about looking for creative ways to improve nutrition and increase exercise, the two main factors that influence overall health,” Little wrote in a prepared statement Tuesday. “Secretary Kennedy said it so well: we need to take better care of ourselves and each other. He said it is an act of patriotism, and the future of our nation depends on it. Idaho couldn’t agree more.”
In Utah, lawmakers approved and Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill seeking to prohibit soda purchases under SNAP in the Beehive State. Kennedy visited Salt Lake City last week to celebrate the bill, along with other “Make America Healthy Again” legislation passed in Utah.
How will the SNAP bill affect local retailers?
Business industry representatives oppose the bill. Arguing the bill wouldn’t be workable, Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said it would cause grocery stores to stop accepting SNAP.
But bill cosponsor Senate Majority Caucus Chair Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, says he’s skeptical the bill would be hard on retailers. He said the bill’s candy definition is used in 24 other states’ sales tax laws.
Idaho’s new law takes effect July 1.
In a prepared statement, Washington, DC.-based nonprofit Food Research & Action Center SNAP Deputy Director Gina Plata-Nino critiqued SNAP restrictions, saying they “only deepen food insecurity and strip people of their autonomy.”
“This push to restrict what Idaho households can buy is an ill-conceived, recycled attempt to shame people who need food assistance and strip them of their dignity and autonomy when data shows that their diet isn’t much different from anyone else’s,” Plata-Nino told the Idaho Capital Sun.

Little signed the bill into law on Tuesday, the governor’s office announced in a news release. The bill passed the Idaho House on a 48-20 vote, after passing the Senate on a 25-10 vote with amendments.
In the Idaho governor’s office news release announcing Little signed the bill, Kennedy wrote in a prepared statement, “I urge all governors to follow Idaho’s lead and submit innovative SNAP waivers to the USDA to reverse the childhood chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”
Bill’s candy definition is broad, and would ban granola and power bars, critics say
Pushback has largely focused on the bill’s broad candy definition, which critics say would also ban granola bars and power bars.
The bill defines candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners combined with chocolate, fruit, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings” in several forms.
Under the bill, candy would not include items that contain flour or need refrigeration. The Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition, removing an exemption for items with more than 10% flour by weight.
The bill’s soda definition also appears to be broad.

Under the bill, soda includes nonalcoholic beverages with sweeteners, artificial or natural. But the bill doesn’t consider soda to be drinks with more than 50% juice, containing milk or milk substitutes, or that need preparation, such as powders or concentrates.
About 132,000 Idahoans are enrolled in SNAP, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare figures, receiving an average of $177 in monthly program benefits.
If the federal U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, doesn’t grant Idaho’s candy/soda SNAP ban waiver, the bill says Health and Welfare “shall request such a waiver annually until such a waiver is granted.”
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would not have a fiscal impact on the state budget.
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement she was excited more states “are heeding the call to Make America Healthy Again.”
“Governor Little is a true partner to USDA, and we look forward to working together on ways to use SNAP to improve health outcomes for Americans and encourage better use of taxpayer dollars,” she added.

The event — part celebration, part memoriam, part commitment to continue fighting —  occurred against the backdrop of federal cuts that advocates say threaten to reverse decades of progress in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.  
HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, attacks the body’s immune system. If untreated, HIV can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, known as AIDS.
Thanks to more effective treatment and prevention tools, developed over several decades, the virus has gone from a death sentence to a manageable chronic disease. In 2019, Connecticut reported that 220 people were newly diagnosed with HIV, down from 802 in 2002. 
AIDS advocate Doug Moffet said when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1987, he waited six weeks for an appointment to get tested and then had to wait another 12 weeks to receive the result. 
“The world is a very different place,” Moffet said, comparing what he went through in the 1980s to today’s reality, where people can receive the results of a rapid antibody test within 30 minutes, which can be confirmed with a lab test within just a few days.
But federal funding cuts could reverse that hard-earned progress, several speakers said.
Of the nearly 800 National Institutes of Health research grants terminated by the Trump administration, roughly 29% — over 200 grants — relate to HIV/AIDS, according to an article in the science journal Nature.
Layoffs and workforce reductions at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services could also threaten the HIV/AIDS programs.
“It’s amazing to me how far we’ve come with regard to HIV in this country,” André McGuire, a retired lawyer, pastor and HIV activist who has been living with the virus for over 30 years, said as he addressed the crowd Tuesday. 
“If we stop putting money into prevention, then the same thing that happened at the beginning of this epidemic will occur again,” he said.
Advocates also raised concerns over a line item in the governor’s proposed budget that cuts $300,000 in funding for HIV prevention. West Hartford Democratic Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, who co-chairs the Human Services Committee and serves on the Appropriations Committee, called the move “short-sighted.”
“There is no appetite for those cuts on the legislative side,” Gilchrest said. 
Chris Collibee, spokesperson for the Office of Policy and Management, said in an email that the money represents funding that’s gone unused in years past.
“The reduction in the Governor’s budget proposal reflects the historic lapses over the past three years; we do not anticipate this funding adjustment would lead to a reduction in services,” Collibee wrote.
Despite major medical advancements, there is still room to improve on prevention and treatment within certain communities, McGuire said.
As of 2020, nearly 70% of people living with HIV in Connecticut were Black or Hispanic, despite only representing a combined 32% of the state’s population. Black and Hispanic men in the state were diagnosed with HIV at rates 10 and 3.5 times higher than white men, respectively. Black women accounted for more than half of new HIV diagnoses among women. 
McGuire said heterosexual Black men, for example, aren’t tested often enough for HIV, which he attributes, in part, to their own fear of stigma, but also a failure on the part of public health officials to reach them effectively. 
“As a Black male living with HIV, I feel invisible,” McGuire said in an interview with the Connecticut Mirror following the rally, adding that many groups who get funding to do HIV/AIDS research don’t apply their work in Black and brown communities. 
The commemoration included a performance by Hartford’s Proud Drill Drum and Dance Corp, and ended with cheers from the crowd vowing to “fight back.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/doug-moffet-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-15 19:08:59.029137

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)The path of kratom legislation took another turn in the North Dakota Legislature Tuesday as the Senate changed a bill that sought to regulate the plant and turned it into a study. 
Kratom is a plant native to Southeast Asia that is related to the coffee plant. Some people consider it an energy booster, like caffeine, or use it to manage pain. Kratom also has been used to wean people off drugs such as fentanyl and heroin with some people reporting withdrawal symptoms. 
Earlier this session, lawmakers considered versions of legislation that proposed to ban kratom, require state regulation by two different agencies or various study proposals.
On Tuesday, Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, proposed an amendment to turn House Bill 1566 into a study by Legislative Management. 
The amendment and the final bill passed on 31-15 votes. 
Pain relief or a problem? North Dakota lawmakers hear kratom debate

The journey isn’t over yet for the kratom bill. It will be returned to the House, which passed a version giving the Agriculture Department regulatory authority and about $600,000 for two employees. 
Magrum said the wide-ranging attempts to regulate kratom by the Legislature, with its members largely unfamiliar with the plant, showed that a study made more sense. 
Kratom-related products are available to consumers, largely through online sales. 
Sen. Todd Beard, R-Williston, opposed the study amendment, noting that the kratom industry is advocating for regulation to combat adulterated products. 
Some products that contain kratom also include synthetic ingredients that enhance the opioid-like effects of kratom. 
The North Dakota Board of Pharmacy advocated for adding mitragynine, derived from kratom, to a list of controlled substances under state law.
The proposed study would look at potential uses for kratom and potential regulations on the production and sale of kratom products.  
Magrum said after the vote that he has used kratom on a couple of occasions to treat back pain. 
He said the first time he made the mistake of taking it on an empty stomach, which made his stomach hurt so much he forgot about his back pain, he joked. 
“At least people are learning about it,” Magrum said.

,DC,2025-04-15 22:25:53+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Judge: 'Nothing has been done' by Trump officials to return wrongly deported Maryland man,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-nothing-has-been-done-trump-officials-return-wrongly-deported-maryland-man,,"GREENBELT, MARYLAND — A federal judge in Maryland on Tuesday ordered a defiant Trump administration to provide evidence about how it has tried to secure the release of an immigrant mistakenly deported to a brutal mega-prison in El Salvador, saying that to date, the record shows “nothing has been done.”District Judge Paula Xinis laid out a two-week timeline for the government to produce sworn statements on whether and how immigration officials are complying with her previous court order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia.“Discovery will bear out whether you have,” Xinis said, referring to the process through which information is disclosed in court. “And if you haven’t, whether it’s a choice or on justified ground.”“Cancel vacation, cancel other appointments. I’m usually very good about things like that in my courtroom, but not this time,” she said during a hearing in Greenbelt, Maryland.Xinis, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, had ordered the administration to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. by April 7.A federal appeals court swiftly upheld Xinis’ order. The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the justices ruled 9-0 Thursday that the administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return — though they stopped short of requiring it — and provide the El Salvadoran due process through the U.S. immigration courts.The Supreme Court “could not have been clearer,” Xinis said to Drew Ensign, the deputy assistant attorney general who represented the government Tuesday.Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, who lived with his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen, and their 5-year-old child, was apprehended by immigration officials in mid-March.He was among roughly 260 Venezuelan men the U.S. flew on commercial jets, without due process, to Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.Garcia has no criminal history in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country, according to court filings in the lawsuit Vasquez Sura brought against the government last month.An immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 shielding his return to El Salvador because of near certainty he would face violence and persecution.White House echoes BukeleU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement admitted in court documents that Abrego Garcia’s removal on March 15 was an “administrative error.”The White House maintains it has no power to ask El Salvador to release Abrego Garcia from CECOT, and that Xinis overstepped her authority in ordering the administration to conduct foreign affairs.The White House also asserts Abrego Garcia is a “foreign terrorist” and a member of the El Salvadoran gang MS-13, which the administration designated a foreign terrorist organization in February.“Deporting him was always going to be the end result,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday at the daily press briefing.“There is never going to be a world in which this is an individual who’s going to live a peaceful life in Maryland,” she said.El Salvador President Nayib Bukele told journalists Monday during a visit to the Oval Office, “I don't have the power to return him to the United States,” labeling Abrego Garcia as a “terrorist.”The government echoed Bukele’s comments in its daily status report.“DHS does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation,” Joseph Mazarra, acting general counsel for DHS, wrote in Monday’s report.Following a tense hearing Friday, where the government refused to provide the whereabouts of Abrego Garcia, Xinis ordered the administration to provide the daily updates.On Tuesday, Xinis told Ensign that the government has provided “very little information of any value” in the reports.“As a factual matter, I do need evidence in this record because to date what the record shows is nothing has been done,” Xinis said.Ruling requested on contemptPrior to Tuesday’s hearing, Vasquez Sura asked the court to order immigration officials to arrange for her husband’s return by the end of April 14.She also asked the court to mandate government officials provide documents and depositions related to Abrego Garcia’s release, and to show cause as to why Xinis should not hold the government in contempt of court for not complying with orders to bring Abrego Garcia back.Xinis said she will not make a decision on contempt until she reviews a record of evidence.The government maintains the Supreme Court’s decision does not mean they must work with El Salvador to release Abrego Garcia because the president, not federal courts, has jurisdiction over foreign affairs.The administration also contends that the Supreme Court’s use of the term “facilitate” only means that they need to remove “domestic” barriers to bringing Abrego back to the U.S. — not that they would have to work with El Salvador to secure his release.“Indeed, no other reading of ‘facilitate’ is tenable — or constitutional — here,” they wrote in a response to Vasquez Sura’s request.In the Oval Office Monday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the U.S. would provide a plane, but cannot force Bukele to release Abrego Garcia.Ensign provided a transcript of the Oval Office meeting to the court 15 minutes prior to Tuesday’s hearing, according to Xinis.“I don’t consider what happened yesterday as evidence before this court yet,” Xinis said.Ensign pushed back on Xinis’ order for expedited discovery, saying that the issue is a “narrow interpretative dispute” of what the word facilitate means that “does not require discovery.”After pushing back again, Xinis responded, “I just don’t think it’s that difficult. I think you want to make it that difficult because getting to the facts may not be that favorable.”Seized while looking for workAbrego Garcia came to the U.S. without legal authorization in 2011, fleeing violence in his home country of El Salvador, according to court records.Six years later while he was looking for work at a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, he was taken into custody by Prince George’s County Police Department.While there, he was questioned about gang affiliation and law enforcement did not believe he was not a member of the MS-13 gang, according to court records.The evidence officers submitted included Abrego Garcia wearing a Chicago Bulls hat, a hoodie and a statement from a confidential informant that stated he was a member of MS-13, according to court documents.While he was never charged with, or convicted of being, in a gang, he was kept in ICE detention while his case proceeded before an immigration judge.",,,,2025-04-15 19:08:59.029137

In-school violence educators and members of the criminal justice system gathered together during National Child Abuse Awareness Month to call attention to the importance of shining a light on violence against children so communities can respond more proactively to abuse.
Child abuse is not an issue, it’s a crisis, Senior Deputy Director for Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ (MDHHS) Children’s Services Administration Demetrius Starling told the crowd outside the Capitol.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowlege child abuse and neglect as “serious public health problems” which can have lifelong negative impacts on a person’s health and opportunities. Physical harm, psychological abuse and sexual violence are all forms of child abuse that impact hundreds of millions of children globally, according to the World Health Organization.
Child abuse is an every day problem that the adults in charge can’t afford to ignore, Starling said. About one in six of Michigan’s children experience abuse or neglect, according to Michigan state data.
“As a society, we have a moral obligation to protect children from harm. That’s not rocket science. Preventing child abuse is a collective responsibility that reflects our values and commitment to human rights. Children are the future for our communities, and ensuring that safety and well being is essential for the continued growth and development of our society,” Starling said. “Community awareness events play an important role in preventing child abuse and neglect by educating the public about available programs services and critical topics such as parent education.”
And those programs are being utilized, Starling said, noting that in 2024, the Michigan Children’s Trust Fund, a statewide nonprofit group funding child abuse prevention programming, partnered with community groups to organize 531 community awareness events which reached over 75,000 people.

Eliminating child abuse can’t simply be reactionary, though understanding the signs of abuse and neglect and reporting systems is valuable, Starling said. To truly fight child abuse, prevention has to be the focus.
And that can be hard to make people understand, Michigan Children’s Trust Fund Board Chair Amy Tattrie Loepp told attendees at the rally Tuesday.
“Prevention is a really tough thing to get funded, because how do you prove that something didn’t happen,” Tarrie Loepp said.

It’s easier to get programs that respond to violence funded than prevention measures, Loepp said, but ultimately empowering schools, communities and families to heal and learn how to end cycles of violence saves the state money in responding to violence and creates a society where the smallest Michiganders can live with better opportunities.

(Getty Images)Kentucky students are part of a federal lawsuit challenging U.S. Department of Defense policies that led to schools at Fort Campbell and other military bases removing books about slavery and civil rights. 
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is one of the defendants as lawyers ask the court to block Trump administration executive orders related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).
Filed in the United States District Court for Eastern Virginia Tuesday, the suit slams “system-wide censorship” that the plaintiffs say violates students’ First Amendment right to receive information. 
American Civil Liberties Union chapters in Kentucky and Virginia are joining the national ACLU in filing the suit on behalf of 12 students from six families.

Students in fourth grade, kindergarten and pre-kindergarten at Fort Campbell’s Barsanti Elementary School are among the plaintiffs. Other plaintiffs are enrolled in schools  in Virginia, Italy and Japan. They are among more than 67,000 students enrolled worldwide in schools run by the Department of Defense Education Activity.
Via executive order Trump directed schools receiving federal funding to not teach “ideology that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as individuals;” he also told the Armed Forces to dissolve DEI offices and directed all federal agencies to recognize only cisgender male and female identities.  
In February, Clarksville Now, a news outlet in Clarksville, Tennessee, reported Fort Campbell librarians were busy “scrubbing for books that contain references to slavery, the civil rights movement and anything else related to diversity, equity and inclusion” in compliance with Trump’s orders. 
Fort Campbell is an Army base than spans the Kentucky-Tennessee border between Hopkinsville and Clarksville.
Fort Campbell schools also had to remove “bulletin boards that reference Black History Month and Black leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks,” according to Clarksville Now. 
The ACLU lawsuit says Trump’s orders “censor references to slavery, civil rights, race, ethnicity, immigration, diversity, sexual orientation and gender identity.” 
“While the government has broad discretion to populate public school libraries  and create curricula, the First Amendment imposes guardrails to ensure removals are justified,” the brief says. “The government cannot suppress discussion of race and gender in public schools simply because a new  presidential administration finds certain viewpoints on those topics to be politically incorrect.” 
Corey Shapiro, legal director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said in a statement that students “have a right to receive an education that includes an open and honest dialogue about America’s history.” 
“Censoring books and canceling assignments about the contributions of Black Americans is not only wrong, but antithetical to our First Amendment rights,” Shapiro said.
Being part of a military family does not erase students’ constitutional rights, said Emerson Sykes, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, in a Tuesday statement. Sykes said that Defense Department schools “are some of the most diverse and high achieving in the nation, making it particularly insulting to strip their shelves of diverse books and erase women, LGBTQ people, and people of color from the curriculum to serve a political goal. Our clients deserve better, and the First Amendment demands it.” 
The ACLU says the Department of Defense has prohibited cultural awareness months — including Black History Month, Pride Month, Women’s History Month and National Hispanic Heritage Month — and that books reportedly removed include “The Kite Runner” by Khaled Hosseini and “Hillbilly Elegy” by Vice President J.D. Vance, as well as a preparation guide for the Advanced Placement psychology exam. 
The Lantern has asked the Department of Defense Education Activity for a response to the lawsuit.
The nation’s military academies also are under pressure from Hegseth’s office to eliminate DEI, prompting the Naval Academy to remove almost 400 books from its libraries. The New York Times reports that Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” a memoir of growing up Black in America, was removed while two copies of Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” remain on the shelves in Annapolis.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s top-ranking state Republicans called a news conference in front of the governor’s mansion on Tuesday to celebrate yet another year of Utah ranking No. 1 for its economic outlook, according to a new report released by the pro “limited government” think tank American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). 
To Gov. Spencer Cox, House Speaker Mike Schultz and Senate President Stuart Adams, Utah taking the report’s top spot for 18 years in a row validates how Utah’s GOP-controlled Legislature has been managing the state, not just decades into the past, but also to this day.
By nurturing a business-friendly climate with low personal and corporate tax rates along with “family friendly” policies, they said Utah is continuing its nearly two-decade streak of setting an example for other states to follow. 
Alongside its No. 1 economic outlook ranking, Utah also ranked No. 3 in the nation in the ALEC report for “economic performance” based on its gross domestic product growth, domestic migration and non-farm payroll employment growth. 
It’s a ranking not all Utah leaders agree with, however, as some Democrats point to working class Utahns’ struggle to afford to live in the state.
Utah tops ALEC’s list of states with the best economic outlook, again

To Cox, Utah’s secret sauce is state leaders’ “forward-thinking nature” on economic, business and tax policy that fosters growth over decades — work that he said isn’t easy or “sexy” in today’s polarized political landscape. And it’s work that takes years, sometimes decades, to have an impact. 
“As I talk to my colleagues around the country, this is really rare,” Cox said. “It’s very unique. The incentive structure around elections is to only look forward maybe two years or four years at most in our state. And that is true of most states.” 
The governor said there’s a “pull” to focus today’s legislation in reaction to national hot-button issues. Without naming names, he said he spoke with a fellow governor from “a state that is very close to ours” who said “the biggest problem I have with my Legislature right now is they only care about right now.”
“One of the reasons that a lot of states aren’t doing the policy work that our Legislature is doing is because it’s hard and it’s boring,” he said. “There are not a lot of great social media memes about policy work that was done 40 years ago, (like) truth and taxation stuff. This stuff isn’t sexy. It’s not fun. You don’t see immediate results the next year, it’s just not made for today.” 
Utah isn’t immune to that “pull,” Cox acknowledged. Political “toxicity” is among the concerns he named that could threaten Utah’s economic ranking, which he said could “turn us into every other state, where we just focus on the stuff that really doesn’t matter but gets the most attention.” 
“I will just tell you, there are a lot of new legislators who came in not interested in this stuff,” Cox said. “(They’re) really interested in a lot of other stuff that gets a lot of attention. And we have to be intentional about passing that on and making sure that every generation (of leaders), they realize that this is who we are. This stuff matters and we have to keep going.”

He also named the state’s stubbornly high housing costs and energy challenges as other issues that could spell trouble — but he also expressed optimism that the Utah Legislature is working to tackle those problems, not shy away. 
Cox didn’t point to specific issues or legislators, but in recent years some of Utah’s most attention-grabbing and controversial bills stem from national hot-button issues. Last year, the Legislature approved transgender bathroom restrictions and anti-DEI measures in higher education and public entities. This year, Utah became the first state in the nation to enact a broad flag ban in schools and government-owned buildings and the first to ban adding fluoride to public water. Cox supported and signed the fluoride ban, but allowed the flag ban to become law without his signature. 
An ALEC-backed bill, however, was among the most controversial to win approval from the 2025 Utah Legislature: HB267 which bans public sector unions from collective bargaining. In a Feb. 19 post, ALEC deemed the bill’s sponsors “policy champions” for their effort to “increase government accountability to state taxpayers.” But a referendum effort is underway to overturn the law. Wednesday, the Protect Utah Workers Coalition is expected to deliver its signatures in its bid to put the referendum on the ballot. 
Why does Utah rank No. 1?
For its annual “Rich States, Poor States” rankings, ALEC — a nonprofit that convenes state legislators and corporations to draft model legislation that is “dedicated to the principles of limited government, free markets and federalism,” according to its site — said its economic outlook rankings are a forecast based on state standings in 15 policy variables. 
“Generally speaking, states that spend less — especially on income transfer programs — and states that tax less — particularly on productive activities such as working or investing — experience higher growth rates than states that tax and spend more,” the 2025 report says. 
Utah ranked high for its lack of an estate or inheritance tax, a low state minimum wage of $7.25, its status as a right-to-work state, and average workers’ compensation costs of $0.86. It also won points for “recently legislated tax changes” (lawmakers this year cut taxes for a fifth year in a row, totaling $1.4 billion over time), its flat corporate and income rate of 4.55%, and a relatively low property tax burden of $23.54 per $1,000 of personal income, among other policies.  
Utah Legislature OKs another round of tax cuts, totaling $1.4 billion in 5 years

Adams, the state’s Senate president, also pointed to a newly published report by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute that shows Utah’s median household income of $98,336 ranked the state highest in the U.S. when adjusted for price parity.  
“I mean, how can you get better than being the No. 1 economy with the best personal income?” Adams, R-Layton said. “You have families making a lot of money. And that is way cool. They can send their kids to college.” 
Though critics often point to Utah’s bottom-of-the-nation rankings when it comes to per-pupil education spending, Adams said the state has been increasing public education spending, including a boost to teacher pay this year that legislative leaders say put Utah among the top states in the Mountain West with the highest starting salaries for teachers.
“We’re cutting taxes and paying teachers more. How do you do that without a strong economy? … Not many states can do both,” Adams said. “It’s a great day, not only for the state of Utah, but it is a really good day for those that want to have personal wealth and be able to take care of their families.”
Don’t let economic ranking ‘cloud over our shortfalls,’ top Democrat says
Not everyone agrees that ALEC’s rankings are a holistic indicator of Utah’s performance as a state. One of the state’s top Democrats, House Minority Leader Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City, issued a statement on Tuesday arguing that ALEC’s report “provides a concerningly biased evaluation of economic success in our state.” 
“Rather than accounting for factors that affect regular working people and families, the index praises Utah for its low minimum wage and tax cuts in favor of corporations,” she said. 
That’s problematic given that wages have not kept pace with cost of living, Romero said. She added that economic uncertainty under President Donald Trump’s second administration could bring more stress for businesses and working-class families. 
“Rising housing costs, increasing prices on basic necessities, and stagnant wages have left countless Utahns struggling to make ends meet in the very communities they’ve called home for generations,” she said. “On top of that, federal layoffs and our current economic uncertainty have forced businesses to make difficult decisions, resulting in even more financial stress for working families across the state. All of this compounds a growing sense of fear and frustration.”

Romero added that “although we celebrate these rankings, we must not allow them to cloud over our shortfalls.”
“Utah has consistently ranked among the lowest states for women’s equality, and is regularly listed among the ten worst states for workers, with particularly poor outcomes in wages, collective bargaining rights, and labor protections,” she said. “As a state, we must protect the economic outlook for all Utahns, not only a select few.”
For years, though, Utah’s conservative leadership has applauded ALEC’s rankings as a gold standard. 
Schultz, the House speaker, said ALEC’s ranking shows Utah’s success is “rooted in the principles that work: low taxes, reasonable spending, and a business-friendly but most importantly a family-friendly environment that fosters innovation and upward mobility.” 
“It’s capitalism, it’s competition,” Adams said. “It’s trying to make things better. I have 16 grandkids. Talk about vision. I want those 16 grandkids to have better upward mobility, to have a better life than I have. … That’s what we do in Utah. Competition is a great thing, and I look forward to other states pushing us.” 
A rising competitor 
In that spirit of competition, Cox, Adams and Schultz chuckled when Jonathan Williams, ALEC president and co-author of the report, noted that one state is on the rise and could be giving Utah a run for its money in coming years: Tennessee. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We saw Tennessee this year move from No. 12 to No. 2, and now is nipping at the heels of Utah,” he said.  
Tennessee ranked high for its lack of a personal income tax, no estate tax, its low property tax burden, and “personal income tax progressivity,” which the report defined as the difference between average tax liability per $1,000 at incomes of $50,000 and $150,000.” 
Utah leaders have repeatedly said they want Utah to get rid of its income tax — but that would require a major tax overhaul legislators have not yet tackled, and a drastic change to how the state funds public education, which is required under the Utah Constitution to be funded through income tax revenue. In the meantime, though, lawmakers continue to gradually cut the income tax rate. 
Speaking about Utah’s competition with other states, though, Cox said he’s happy to see Tennessee surface as a healthy competitor. “They deserve it. I love what they’re doing out there.” He added that the state is “copying many things that are happening in Utah, and I couldn’t be more proud.” 
He added Utah leaders “reject the zero-sum mindset. We do not believe that our economy is a zero-sum game, that if someone else wins, we lose. That’s not how we look at it.” 
Still, the governor indicated Utah will continue to look for ways to keep its No. 1 ALEC ranking.
He half-jokingly said at the end of Tuesday’s news conference, “We’re going to take care of Tennessee. Don’t worry.”

Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, testifies against a bill that sought to authorize the State Investment Board to divest the Legacy Fund from Chinese investments. (Jeff Beach / North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Senate on Tuesday sank a bill that would have authorized the State Investment Board to divest from Legacy Fund holdings in companies headquartered  in China.
Under the “prudent investor rule,” which governs trustees of investment portfolios, the board must prefer “qualified investment firms and financial institutions with a presence in the state.” It cannot choose not to favor a company purely based on its home country.
The bill, which failed by a 20-26 vote, would have updated this language to let the board voluntarily cut ties with Chinese businesses.
Bill requiring Legacy Fund disclosure website sees support in North Dakota Legislature

According to the North Dakota Retirement and Investment Office, that applies to only about  $246 million of the $12 billion in the fund. That equates to about 2.1%
Primary sponsor Rep. Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown, has said North Dakota should do away with holdings in Chinese companies due to human rights abuses committed by the Chinese Communist Party, as well as concerns that China’s government is a national security threat to the United States.
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, said he supported the bill because it addresses these problems while still giving the State Investment Board flexibility over the fund’s investments.
“Our own intelligence agency has identified that there are significant threats that come from the Chinese Communist Party,” he said on the Senate floor.
North Dakota Legacy Fund takes big hit amid stock market volatility

Critics of the bill said it would hamper growth of the Legacy Fund by discouraging investment in an entire country’s market.
Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, said it’s unusual for North Dakota to single out countries in state law. 
The closest comparison may be a 2023 law the North Dakota Legislature adopted prohibiting investment practices that would result in a boycott of Israel.
Klein said many Chinese companies are good-faith business partners to the United States and shouldn’t be penalized just because of where they’re located. 
The Retirement and Investment Board took a neutral stance on the bill.
Earlier this month, the Senate passed another Legacy Fund-related policy, House Bill 1319, which requires the Retirement and Investment Office to create a website detailing Legacy Fund holdings. Gov. Kelly Armstrong signed the bill into law last week.

(Screenshot from Florida Channel)The state’s new attorney general may have engaged in criminal conduct in organizing the transfer of legal settlement money through the Hope Florida Foundation to campaign against a marijuana legalization initiative, a key Republican House member said Tuesday.
“Given Mr. [James] Uthmeier’s involvement in the settlement and then the transfer to Hope Florida and the soliciting these grant proposals and then immediately receiving that to his PAC, yeah,” Andrade told reporters after the meeting when asked whether the transactions might be criminal.
“That’s very much what it looks like. But again, I’m not a prosecutor,” Andrade said.
  State Rep. Alex Andrade (photo via FL House of Representatives.)
Andrade, who is an attorney, told reporters following a lengthy meeting of the House Health Care Budget Committee, which he chairs, that while he plans on calling a spate of others to testify before the committee next week, the job may be getting too large for his budget subcommittee to handle. 
Indeed, Andrade on social media pushed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s office to investigate the transfer of the funds. Medicaid is a health care safety net program for the poor elderly and disabled that is funded with both state and federal dollars.
“I don’t want to guess whether or not she will or not,” he said about Bondi’s potential involvement. “At this point, though, given what we keep turning over and finding out every time I flip over a rock and find something new, this feels way bigger than a subcommittee.”
Tuesday’s House hearing represented an almost unthinkable moment, another escalation of a feud between the governor and House Republicans. It occurred as DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis, who initiated Hope Florida in 2021, held a press conference in Pensacola, in Andrade’s House district, where the governor railed against House Republicans and said they were pushing a “hoax” with Democrats and the “liberal media.”
DeSantis suggested that the First Lady, widely thought to be considering a gubernatorial run in 2026, was being targeted because of her strength as a candidate.
“And look, some people feel threatened by the First Lady, let’s be clear about that. You saw her up here. If you are looking at 2026, and you’ve got some horse, you don’t want her anywhere near that. You are very worried, because she runs circles around their people. Everybody knows that,” DeSantis said.
Andrade, though, denied that was the case.
“I never mentioned Casey in any of this. I mean,  you know, if I was in town I would have gone to it, although it sounds as if I wasn’t invited,” Andrade said. “You know, I hope you had a fun time in my district. I’m really proud to represent it.”
Money transfer
The question is how a $10 million payment from a state-contracted Medicaid managed care plan wound up in the hands of two groups that turned around and gave money to the group battling last year’s marijuana amendment.
The DeSantis administration organized opposition to that and the abortion-rights amendment using state resources. Both proposals were broadly popular but fell narrowly short of the requited 60% approval rate.
DeSantis’ anti-pot committee, Keep Florida Clean, was run by Uthmeier, then DeSantis’ chief of staff, whom the governor subsequently appointed state attorney general following Ashley Moody’s departure for the U.S. Senate.
The $10 million payment to the Hope Florida Foundation was part of a larger $67 million settlement the state reached with the giant contractor Centene stemming from Medicaid overpayments involving the  delivery of pharmacy benefits and services. Uthmeir was a signatory to the settlement agreement. 
Meet the players
The committee met for more than three hours, questioning Joshua Hay, president of the Hope Florida Foundation; Department of Children and Families Secretary Taylor Hatch; and Erik Dellenback, who serves as the Governor’s Liaison for Faith & Community and executive director of Hope Florida in the Executive Office of the Governor.
Hope Florida, according to its website, is a government initiative that serves as a connection point between the public and private sector, faith-based communities, and nonprofits. Hope “navigators” work at agencies across state government with people seeking assistance in transitioning from government benefits to economic self-sufficiency.
The Hope Florida Foundation is the not-for-profit direct-support organization that assists the Department of Children and Families with Hope Florida.
The foundation has failed to submit an annual audit to the state’s auditor general, has no code of ethics for its members to follow, and has failed to file tax returns.










This feels way bigger than a subcommittee.


– Rep. Alex Andrade


Hay, whose position with the foundation is voluntary, was sworn in before testifying. Andrade explained that Hatch and Dellenback weren’t sworn in because they are state employees and thus are expected to provide truthful testimony.
In addition to serving as the Hope Florida Foundation chair, Hay is the founder of the management consulting firm Indelible Solutions, which he testified operates in 23 states and has millions of dollars in contracts with the state of Florida.
Hay, joined by his legal counsel, Mark Herron, said the foundation board of directors plans a meeting Thursday and will address the delinquent paperwork.
He testified that he’s been working for about a month with Tallahassee attorney Mohammad Jazil, who frequently represents the state in lawsuits and advises Keep Florida Clean, and who is advising Hope Florida on the requisite paperwork. 
Hay said that attorney Jeff Aaron advised him to work with Jazil on the paperwork. Aaron is a Republican attorney who successfully defended the governor in the lawsuit filed by suspended Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren. 
The testimony didn’t sit well with Andrade.
“Jeff Aaron connected you with Mohammad Jazil, the attorney for Keep Florida Clean, to help Hope Florida’s foundation in complying with the paperwork, to retroactively justify this payment. Is that what I am hearing right now? Members, I am sorry, I am a little flabbergasted at this revelation.”
Hay also testified that the Hope Florida Foundation generally awards grants to individuals and organizations in the $1,500 to $2,500 range. It made two $5 million payments to Secure Florida’s Future and Save Our Society from Drugs.
Hay acknowledged that those payments were made without approval by the board of directors.
Trickle down effects
  Senate President Ben Albritton (photo via Florida Senate)
Although the upper chamber has stayed out of the House’s probe into Hope Florida, the developments led Senate President Ben Albritton on Tuesday to “take a pause at this point” on a bill cementing the program in the governor’s office, said Katherine Betta, a spokesperson for Albritton.
“State government should be about continuous improvement. When things are not as transparent as we would like, or as they should be, we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater, but we should improve and look for opportunities to do better moving forward,” Albritton said in a prepared statement.
Still, scrutiny over Hope Florida seeped into a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Agriculture, Environment, and General Government Tuesday.
Democratic and Republican senators raised concerns over SB 820, which would formalize in statute the Office of Faith and Community, because of Dellenback’s leadership positions in both the faith office and Hope Florida. 
“I don’t dislike it enough to vote no on it, but I am very concerned. I think we need to think carefully now that more information has come forward in this own committee meeting,” Winter Haven Republican Sen. Colleen Burton said. “I think we need to be very, very careful that if we do enshrine this in statute, that this office stands on its own two feet, that it’s not associated with other organizations.” 
Filed by Jacksonville Republican Sen. Clay Yarborough, the bill passed with three “no” votes, all cast by Democrats, and advanced to its final committee stop. The House companion, HB 293, is awaiting its final committee hearing.

(Logo via Iowa Board of Regents)State universities are planning to increase tuition for undergraduate and graduate students once again this fall, pending approval from the Iowa Board of Regents, according to board documents released Tuesday.
If approved by the board at its June meeting, University of Iowa and Iowa State University resident undergraduate students will see their tuition increase by 3%, with a proposed 2.7% increase for in-state, undergraduate students attending the University of Northern Iowa. The regents will consider the proposals at their April 23-24 meeting on the ISU campus.
UNI is the only state university to propose a larger tuition increase rate than last year. Both the UI and ISU had 3% increases in the 2024-2025 school year while UNI tuition increased by 2%.
Out-of-state undergraduate students will also see their tuition increase, according to the proposed rates document. The proposed rate increase of 0.9% from the UI is the only one coming in lower than resident increases. ISU requested a 4.5% increase for nonresident students and UNI requested 3%.
“Funding from the proposed tuition increases will help address growing financial challenges,” the document stated, “including inflationary cost increases, recruiting and retaining faculty and staff in national markets, health care, meeting collective bargaining terms, deferred maintenance needs in academic facilities, and student financial aid to provide higher education opportunities to more students.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Each of the state universities has proposed a 3% tuition increase for resident graduate students. ISU proposed the same increase for nonresident graduate students, while UNI requested 1.4% and the UI requested 1.1%.
Certain undergraduate and graduate programs will request their own tuition rate increases or freezes for the upcoming year. One proposal from UNI would have the university offer applicants in neighboring states a slightly lower rate than what will be standard for out-of-state students.
Multiple programs in the UI Carver College of Medicine have proposed keeping tuition flat for the 2025-2026 academic year for out-of-state or all students, including master’s programs in athletic training and clinical nutrition and the doctor of physical therapy degree. The MD program in the college of medicine, which the document stated has been in a tuition freeze for the past five years, is requesting a 3% increase across the board and the physician’s assistant program is asking for a 4% increase for residents and 3% for non-resident students.
The UI radiation sciences program is asking for a $703 increase for all students in order to complete its three-year tuition plan to reach a balanced budget, according to the document.
“The program is essential to SUI’s mission and the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, as it provides healthcare personnel in the areas of diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy,” the document stated. “There are critical shortages of these healthcare personnel.”
Students in ISU’s veterinary medicine program could see tuition increases to the tune of 3.5% for residents and 3% for nonresidents, according to the program’s request. In order to align the tuition of sophomores with that of juniors and seniors in the ISU Ivy College of Business, the university is asking for a $1,412 increase for residents and $2,644 for out-of-state students to complete the third year of increases.
Each of the universities will also propose increases to mandatory fees, totaling 3% for the UI, 2.7% for UNI and 1.7% for ISU.
“The proposed tuition rates at all three universities combined are projected to generate $42 million in incremental revenue for FY 2026, approximately 2.4% of the current total general education fund operating budget,” the document stated.
These increases would bring the total cost of attendance, including room and board and other expenses, to $29,958 at the UI, $25,950.90 at ISU and $24,017 at UNI.
When compared to their peer universities, each of Iowa’s public colleges are at or below average for both resident and nonresident tuition and fee costs, according to the document. UI tuition and fees for out-of-state-students are the lowest of its peer group, coming in at $33,371 compared to the average $42,157.

The remaining four cases were in Lea County, where the majority of the outbreak has spread in New Mexico, bringing the measles total to 63 cases. Five of those cases were serious enough to warrant hospitalization.
The New Mexico Department of Health officials recommended Tuesday that parents seek one dose of the measles, mumps rubella vaccine for infants aged 6-11 months living in Doña Ana County, or who will be traveling to either Doña Ana or Lea counties.
“Given how contagious measles is, we expected it to find its way from El Paso County in Texas to neighboring Doña Ana County,” said NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham in a written statement. “No matter where you live in New Mexico, make sure you and your family are up to date with your vaccinations.”
Health officials said measles exposure may have occurred in the past two weeks at the following dates and locations:

April 2: noon to 6 p.m. at Kid’s Kountry Place Preschool and Childcare, 3704 Elk’s Drive
April 3 and April 7: 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Memorial Medical Center Family Medicine Center, 2605 Terrace Drive
April 6: 1 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. at Memorial Medical Center Emergency Department, 2450 S. Telshor Blvd.
April 7: 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Memorial Medical Center Family Medicine Center, 2605 Terrace Drive
April 8: 7:45 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. at Memorial Medical Center Emergency Department and Pediatric unit, 2450 S. Telshor Blvd.

NMDOH requests that anyone exposed or showing symptoms call the measles Helpline at 1-833-796-8773 for help in English or Spanish for vaccine questions or further measles testing. They urged patients to contact doctor’s offices or emergency rooms before coming in to allow them to prepare for a potential measles case.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world, spread through contact with airborne droplets from infected people. People can spread the measles days before symptoms show, which include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a red spotty rash starting on the head and face and spreading over the body.
The most effective prevention against the measles is two doses of the vaccine, according to health officials.
New Mexico’s vaccination rate has more than doubled between Feb. 1 and April 14, with 18,449 vaccinations this year over the 9,863 in the same time period in 2024.
In addition to the 10 walk-in vaccine clinics in eight counties posted to the website, NMDOH announced two additional locations in Las Cruces:

Walk-in vaccine hours are from 1 to 3 p.m. Mondays from 1 to 3 p.m. and 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Friday mornings at the Las Cruces Public Health Office, 1170 N. Solano Drive. (575) 528-5001.
From 10 a.m. to noon and 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesdays at Las Cruces East Mesa Public Health Office, 5220 Holman Road. (575) 382-0540.

In other parts of the state, cases remain unchanged at two infections reported in Eddy County and one infection in Chaves County. Nearly 60% of New Mexico’s measles cases have impacted children, with 17 cases reported in very young children; 19 cases in children ages 7 to 17-years old; and 27 cases in adults.
Texas Health officials reported 20 additional cases Tuesday, totaling 561 cases in 23 counties. The majority of cases remain in Gaines County, which has one of the lowest childhood vaccination rates in Texas.
The U.S. has more than twice the number of measles cases reported in 2024.
Three reported measles deaths have occurred during the outbreak: two Texas children, and one Lea County adult, which is still under investigation, according to a spokesperson for the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator.

The man was sentenced to 33 years, but only five of those were for killing Coba, said David Stumbo, the solicitor who prosecuted the case in Newberry County.

Coba was one of five police dogs killed in the line of duty last year, an all-time high for the state, according to Officer Down, which tracks law enforcement deaths.
A bill senators advanced to the floor Tuesday by a unanimous vote would increase the potential fines and prison time for anyone who kills or injures a police dog or horse in South Carolina.
The existing penalty for killing a police dog or horse is up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000. That’s not nearly enough to show the state is serious about protecting its police dogs, said Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott.
His department lost three police dogs in the line of duty last year, the most of any county.
“Unfortunately, the penalty for killing these dogs, for injuring these dogs, is very minimal,” Lott said.
Under the proposal, killing a four-legged officer could come with a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $20,000. Injuring one would be punishable by up to five years in prison and $5,000 fine.
“This protection is what’s deserved for these canines,” said John Blackmon, president of the South Carolina Fraternal Order of Police. “We owe them a debt, and this protection is that debt.”
Police dogs often save the lives of police officers by going into situations too dangerous for a person or pulling attention away from their handlers, law enforcement officers said.
Lott pointed to Sgt. Warren Cavanagh, who credits his Belgian Malinois, Fargo, with saving his life by taking bullets meant for him during a 2011 shootout. Fargo was the first police dog killed in the state, Lott said.
Police dogs can sniff out drugs and explosives, find the source of arson and take down suspects on the run, said Greenville Sheriff Hobart Lewis. They typically live with their handlers, allowing them to bond both on and off the clock, he said.
“These dogs are certainly more than just a tool,” Lewis said. “They’re law enforcement officers. In our case, they’re deputies. They’re partners. They’re family.”
The dogs are not like other pets, Lewis said. They go through a strict selection process and upwards of 600 hours of training to get ready for duty, he said.
That means the dogs are costly to replace. A dog straight out of handler school — not even fully trained for duty — costs at least $12,500, Lewis said. Other law enforcement agencies, such as Horry County, have reported spending as much as $18,000 for a single police dog, according to a review of the bill by the state’s fiscal experts.
“These animals represent a significant investment of time, money and training,” Lewis said.
Law enforcement officers have seen an increase in violence directed toward police dogs in the past year, officers told the committee. Along with the record number of dogs killed, law enforcement agencies have had an unknown number of dogs hurt while on duty, Lewis said.
Among them was Micky, a Greenville County police dog stabbed repeatedly while deputies attempted to serve a warrant last June, Lewis said.
“These aren’t rare cases anymore,” Lewis said. “They are becoming more and more common, and that should alarm us all.”
As a police officer in Goose Creek and North Charleston, Sen. Brian Adams knew to stay behind the police dogs when they were on assignment together. He was afraid of what he knew they could do, but he also saw how much they helped their handlers, said Adams, the bill’s sponsor.
“They are a great tool and a great partner for our canine handlers,” the Goose Creek Republican said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/leon-lott-1024x497.jpg,,,2025-04-15 18:11:18.312706

Jane Doe, who is concealing her name because of the sensitive nature of the allegations, filed the lawsuit Monday in Taney County Circuit Court. She is represented by the same attorneys who represented Logan Yandell, another survivor of Newman’s abuse.
Newman worked for the Branson-based Christian summer camp for over two decades. He was director of Kanakuk’s “K-Kountry” camp for ages 6 to 11 in 2009 before he was fired and later convicted of sexual abuse. Newman initially pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual abuse, but the case’s prosecutor estimated the number of survivors to be in the hundreds.
Doe was nine years old when she attended K-Kountry in 2008. She was placed in a cabin with older girls and was “bullied” and “taunted,” according to the lawsuit.
She met Newman, who began to “isolate her away from other campers.” He forced Doe into sexual acts, the lawsuit alleges, and told her “if she didn’t do such acts or (if she) said anything to anyone, she would not get to go home.”
Doe repressed what happened until 2024, when the memories came back. She began to question camp leadership’s responsibility in causing “severe emotional trauma.”
The timing of the discovery is important in personal injury claims. Missouri law limits claims to five years from the incident or five years from discovery of the injury, in some cases.
A Christian County Circuit Court judge ruled against Yandell in January in a fraud case he brought against Kanakuk alleged the camp’s CEO lied to his parents and pushed them to sign a settlement and non-disclosure agreement for $250,000 that they otherwise would have continued to fight. The judge ruled Yandell should have known about the camp’s misstatements more than five years prior to his lawsuit.
Newman’s abuse has been well documented, with reports in local and national news outlets and a page on Kanankuk’s website acknowledging the abuse and naming Newman a “master of deception.”
But according to Doe’s lawsuit, Kanakuk leaders knew about Newman’s misdeeds years before she attended camp. Parents had told the camp as far back as 1999 that Newman was behaving inappropriately, such as swimming and four-wheeling nude.
Years prior to Doe’s abuse, Newman’s supervisor recommended that he be fired, the lawsuit says. Instead, he was promoted in 2005.
In 2006, Kanakuk CEO Joe White learned that Newman was “ministering” to children in the evenings in his hot tub, the lawsuit states.
“White felt this was enough of a problem to issue a corrective action. The correction, however, was not to prohibit hot tub encounters, but merely an encouragement to Newman to assess the amount of time he was spending with his family,” says the lawsuit.
White and the camp had a duty to protect campers after repeated reports of sexual abuse, Doe’s attorney Reed Martens argues.
“Despite having explicit knowledge of the particular sexual danger Newman posed to (Doe) prior to the onset of his abuse,” Martens wrote, “Kanakuk defendants did nothing to supervise Newman’s interactions with (Doe), nothing to control Newman and nothing to protect (Doe).”

Free.,"Trump registration requirement carries danger for immigrants who comply, groups warn",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-registration-requirement-carries-danger-immigrants-who-comply-groups-warn,,"Immigrant rights groups are cautioning migrants without legal status about the dangers of obeying the Department of Homeland Security’s directive to register with authorities, group leaders told reporters during a virtual press conference Tuesday.Representatives from immigrant groups across the country said the requirement, which a federal judge upheld last week, is an enforcement tool for President Donald Trump’s administration and that following the directive to register could lead to unlawful detention and deportation.Participants on the call did not explicitly say they were counseling migrants without legal status against complying with the directive, but said people affected should seek legal counsel first.“This tool is to identify individuals for detention, deportation and to threaten with imprisonment if they do not comply,” Angelica Salas, the executive director of the advocacy group the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, said.“These actions are abhorrent to the values of this country, and we will not stand silent to see cruelty as the official immigration policy of this administration. To our community, our message is that you're not alone, you have rights, seek legal guidance, and you're not obligated to provide information that can hurt you or your family.”Under Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, the administration has sent “innocent people” to detention facilities at the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the notorious mega-prison in El Salvador known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, Salas said.The administration has detained immigrants of all legal statuses without due process, and ignored court orders to reverse those actions. Advocates on the press call Tuesday said that defies the law.Immigrants, even without legal status in the country, are “entitled to their day in immigration court,” Nicole Melaku, the executive director of National Partnership for New Americans, said.The directive, which requires immigrants who have registered with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to always carry with them proof of their registration, would also lead to racial profiling of U.S. citizens, advocates have said.No reported registrantsSalas said her organization, which is based in Southern California, does not know of anyone who has completed the registration.The people who are required to register are unclear about whether it is in their interest to comply, and distrust of Trump – who campaigned on an anti-immigration platform and has routinely flouted due process for immigrants – is a major obstacle.“We don't have anybody who has – that we know – yet registered,” she said. “There's a lot of confusion in our community as to whether to do this or not. What does it mean? What are the risks? And I also want to say that … everything that has come from this administration has actually been harmful, so people are taking that into account.”Legal fight continuingU.S. Judge Trevor Neil McFadden, whom Trump appointed to the federal bench in 2017, rejected advocacy groups’ attempt to block the directive, saying in an order last week that the groups hadn’t shown they’d been harmed by it.But the legal fight against the directive will continue, George Escobar, the chief of programs and services at the immigrant services organization CASA, said.In addition to a possible appeal of McFadden’s ruling, Escobar said his organizations would watch “very, very closely” how the administration conducts the operation, with special attention to racial profiling, and would not hesitate to bring court challenges.“We will do everything possible to fight this,” he said. “This may be a show-me-your-papers type of situation where people may be racially profiled, stopped on the street just because they're speaking in other languages, because they look like an immigrant, and has to be asked to show this registration compliance.”Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a message seeking comment Tuesday.",,,,2025-04-15 18:11:18.312706

In a news release, Hull said he would make his official announcement on June 2, exactly one year prior to election day.
Hull has served as mayor of Rio Rancho since winning a run-off election in April, 2014. He was elected to his third four-year term in March 2022.
On his campaign website, Hull lists crime, jobs, education and infrastructure as top “issues” in his campaign. Regarding crime, his website says that the Rio Rancho Police budget “has more than doubled” during Hull’s tenure as mayor “and the city has been consistently ranked one of the safest cities in New Mexico.” The Rio Rancho Observer earlier this year noted an increase in homicides in 2024 in Rio Rancho, but also made Livability’s list of the top 25 best places to live in the Southwest.
Regarding crime, which has been a focal point for Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham — who is term-limited from running again — Hull says his priorities will include: increasing police presence throughout the state; enhancing border security to “end the fentanyl crisis”; and establishing a “zero-tolerance policy for all violent crimes and crimes against children.”
He is the first Republican to announce a gubernatorial run in 2026, and prompted a swift response from state Democratic Party spokesperson Daniel Garcia: “Under Democratic leadership, New Mexico has been a national leader in protecting abortion rights and reproductive healthcare, transitioning to a clean energy economy, early childhood education, and much more,” Garcia said in a statement. “New Mexicans can’t risk reversing our progress in so many key areas by having a Republican Trump lackey as the top executive in our state. It has taken years to recover from the profoundly negative effect New Mexico’s last Republican governor had on our state.”
So far, the Democratic primary for governor has two official candidates: Former Interior Secretary and Congresswoman Deb Haaland and Bernalillo County DA Sam Bregman.
According to their most recent campaign finance reports, Hull has raised just shy of $200,000; Bregman has raised approximately $632,000 and Haaland has raised more than $2.8 million.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gregghull-1024x412.jpeg,,,2025-04-15 18:11:18.312706

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Newsmakers)Indiana Supreme Court justices on Tuesday set a May 20 execution date for death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie, who was convicted in 2002 for killing a law enforcement officer from Beech Grove.
The high court’s decision followed a series of exhausted appeals previously filed by Ritchie and his legal team. The inmate’s request for post-conviction relief was denied in Tuesday’s 13-page order, penned by Chief Justice Loretta Rush, although she disagreed with the decision in her opinion.
Included in the death row inmate’s post-conviction filings are claims that his trial and post-conviction counsel “provided ineffective assistance” by not investigating Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and by failing to “analyze the effect of Ritchie’s childhood exposure to excessive amounts of lead.”
Additionally, counsel emphasized that Ritchie was only 20 years old at the time of the crime, and “recent developments in the law” require the state supreme court to consider his age at sentencing. Ritchie’s team held, too, that the state “engaged in prosecutorial misconduct” throughout his jury trial.
Indiana justices weigh in
Justices said Ritchie “has not persuaded a majority of the Court that there is a reasonable possibility he is entitled to relief,” however.
Even so, Rush said she believed evidence submitted to the court suggests “a strong likelihood” that Ritchie suffered from FASD when he murdered William Toney, the police officer, in 2000.
Story continues below.
Order – SPCR and execution date
 
She noted that Ritchie has recently been evaluated by two FASD experts. Rush preferred to hold off on an execution date so the court has more time to “receive and consider” the experts’ evaluations.
“If those evaluations both confirm that Ritchie suffers from FASD and explain its effect on his behavior when he committed his crimes, a successive petition for post-conviction relief would be authorized,” the chief justice wrote in her opinion. 
But Justices Derek Molter and Geoffrey Slaughter disagreed with Rush. 
“… what Ritchie’s experts turned up is irrelevant. The issue before us is not whether Ritchie suffered from FASD in 2000 or whether he does so today; it is whether his trial counsel were constitutionally ineffective during sentencing for failing to investigate the possibility that Ritchie suffered from FASD then,” Slaughter wrote. 
“On this claim, Ritchie cannot show a ‘reasonable possibility’ of relief,” the justice continued. “Even if he suffered from FASD in 2000, as he now claims for the first time, he did not preserve that claim, so it is procedurally defaulted. And he cannot avoid his default of this claim because his counsel were not ineffective under either standard for assessing counsel’s performance.”
Justice Christopher Goff dissented, in part, saying he “would have temporarily stayed the execution date to consider Ritchie’s claim.”
Justice Mark Massa did not weigh in.
Next steps could bring clemency hearings
When asked to comment, Ritchie’s defense attorneys told the Indiana Capital Chronicle only that they’re “considering next steps,” which is likely to include a clemency petition.
With clemency, the governor — in tandem with Indiana’s Parole Board — can elect to commute a death sentence to life imprisonment or grant a pardon for a criminal offense.

The Indiana Constitution gives the governor exclusive authority to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons for all offenses — including capital crimes — except for treason and impeachment. The parole board is tasked by state law with assisting in that process.
The five-member board, specifically, is responsible for conducting an investigation into the merits of a clemency petition. 
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita — whose office requested an execution date for Ritchie last fall — told the Capital Chronicle on Tuesday that he had been “expecting” an execution date, and that “everything is going to plan.” 
If and when Ritchie files for clemency, Rokita said “we’ll continue on like we do with any other one.”
“Nothing’s changing our plans or procedures based for this fellow versus the last,” he said.
Per court documents, the underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney, the Beech Grove police officer, later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at Toney, who did not survive the shooting.
Executions were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until convicted killer Joseph Corcoran was put to death in December. The state paid $900,000 on execution drugs but won’t say how much was purchased. 
 Ritchie and six other men remain on the state’s death row at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Tuesday the state has submitted a waiver to the federal government to implement work requirements for Iowans on the state’s expanded Medicaid program.
The governor directed the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to seek a waiver to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for work requirements, according to a Tuesday news release — an effort she announced she would take action on at the beginning of the 2025 legislative session.
The news release Tuesday stated the waiver reflects the legislation being considered by Iowa lawmakers, Senate File 615. The bill has been approved by both chambers, but the Senate must approve an amendment from the House before it goes to the governor.

The Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, or IHAWP, the state’s expanded Medicaid program, provides health coverage to able-bodied Iowans from ages 19 to 64 with household incomes at or below 133% of the federal poverty level. There are exceptions to the proposed work requirements, including for people who are considered medically frail or medically exempt under Medicaid , adults caring for a child under age 6 and people in substance abuse treatment programs for up to six months.
The bill proposes that non-exempt IHAWP recipients work at least 80 hours each month to be eligible for health coverage. According to the Iowa HHS proposal, the governor’s waiver proposal sets a 100-hour per month requirement for individuals to remain eligible for coverage. If the federal waiver is rejected under the legislation, the state would be required to end the expanded Medicaid program for all recipients, regardless of whether they are working.
Reynolds said in a statement that she has prioritized ensuring Iowa’s government programs “reflect a culture of work.”
“If you are an able-bodied adult who can work, you should work,” Reynolds said. “We need to return Medicaid back to its core purpose — to provide coverage to the people who truly need it.”
The state estimated that nearly 100,000 individuals currently on IHAWP report having no income, according to the governor’s news release.
The Legislative Services Agency estimated 142,000 of the 181,000 Iowans currently on IHAWP would be subject to work requirements under the Medicaid work requirements bill, and that 32,000 Iowans would likely lose the health coverage if the legislation is implemented. Democratic lawmakers have argued work requirements will result in higher costs to the state, by pushing health care costs from low-income individuals currently on IHAWP to other areas of the state’s health care system.
There will be two public hearings for the waiver — the first at Urbandale Public Library on April 23 at 10:30 a.m., and the second at Marshalltown Public Library on April 29 at 2 p.m., with both meetings available for remote access via Zoom.

(Courtesy of Provo City)About 50 miles from Utah’s capital airport is a small hub that some travelers on the Wasatch Front turn to for ultra-low-cost carriers — the Provo airport. In 2024, about 900,000 passengers used the airport’s four gates to board domestic flights. It was a record-setting number for the facility. However, as soon as this year that number could multiply.
Provo City broke ground for an airport expansion on Monday. The plans are to build an extended apron, increasing parking capacity for aircraft by November, according to a news release from the city.
One of the most substantial changes, however, is scheduled to open by late 2028 — the facility’s expansion to host 10 gates in total.
“Thanks to American Airlines’ frequent daily flights to Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and Phoenix-Sky Harbor (PHX), travelers from PVU now enjoy easy access to over 270 global destinations, both domestic and international,” Brian Torgersen, Provo Airport director, said in the release. “And the connectivity will only improve with our expansion from four gates to ten gates.”
The funding is secured and the demand is growing, the release reads, especially with major events on the state’s horizon. The project’s price tag is $80 million, according to a presentation filed to the Legislature, which will be paid by different programs from the Federal Aviation Administration, the state, Utah County, Mountainland Association of Governments, and Provo City.
This year, lawmakers also approved a one-time payment of $4.5 million to support the project.
“This expansion positions PVU not just as a regional airport, but as a vital part of Utah’s growing transportation network — ready to welcome the world, including visitors for the 2034 Winter Olympics,” Provo Mayor Michelle Kaufusi said in a statement.

But plans will continue beyond this development. By summer 2026, the airport is also scheduled to have a master plan for another two decades.
Utah County pledged $78 million to help fund the expansion, including a $19.5 million up-front payment gathered with a tourism tax, and an annual contribution of $3.9 million for the next 15 years, according to a Utah County news release. The investment would contribute to the gates’ expansion, as well as efforts to grow baggage handling and ticketing areas, and prepare it for international travel.
“This expansion is more than just bricks and mortar — it’s a bold step into the future,” Utah County Commissioner Amelia Powers Gardner said in the release. “We’re building infrastructure that not only meets today’s needs but sets the stage for tomorrow’s growth, global events, and economic opportunity.”

Patrick Morrisey signed Senate Bill 199 into law at Ripley Elementary School in Ripley, W.Va. on Tuesday, April 15, 2025. The bill allows teachers to remove disruptive students from their classrooms. (West Virginia Office of the Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)West Virginia elementary school teachers have spent the last few years asking lawmakers for help addressing an uptick in violent and disruptive student behavior that includes punching, kicking and classroom destruction. On Monday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill aiming to give teachers more control over their classrooms.
“We want our teachers teaching — not babysitting, not disciplining,” Morrisey said during a bill signing event at Ripley Elementary School in Ripley, West Virginia.
The measure, Senate Bill 199, also mandates that school mental health professionals assess removed students to see what could be causing the behavior. 
The most violent attacks on elementary teachers are occurring most frequently in kindergarten classrooms. Educators say the problem is linked to the state’s ongoing substance abuse crisis, and kids are arriving at preschool or kindergarten dealing with trauma, neglect or behavioral issues as a result of neonatal abstinence syndrome.
Sen. Amy Grady, R-Mason, is a fourth grader teacher who spent two years working on the bill after it failed to make it to the governor’s desk last year. 
“The most important part is that we want to make sure that you guys always have a safe classroom and a safe learning environment to learn in and that your teachers have a safe environment to teach in,” Grady told Ripley Elementary students.
Addressing student discipline has been a top ask from teachers across the state as they say student behavior is worsening and data shows suspensions are increasing. Some lawmakers have said they must address the issue to protect teachers and boost the state’s struggling test scores. 
State Schools Superintendent Michele Blatt supported the bill, saying, “I think we have something in place that’s really going to support our teachers and make a difference. I’m thrilled that the governor has decided to sign this.”
‘Streamlined process’ for removing disruptive students 
The bill outlines how and why teachers in kindergarten through sixth grade classrooms can immediately remove students who are violent, threatening or intimidating toward staff or peers, or students’ whose behavior is impeding on other students’ ability to learn. The House of Delegates amended the bill to include pre-K classrooms that are on public school grounds. 
Morrisey called it a “streamlined process” for dealing with these students. 
School counselors and social workers will now be required to determine any underlying cause of the child’s behavior. 
The measure gives the student a two- to four-week probationary period on a behavioral plan for improvement. If improvement isn’t made, the student can be placed in an alternative school or behavioral intervention program. 
Fewer than half of the state’s 55 counties have alternate learning centers.
“If there’s no county program, the student may be removed from school and find alternative learning environments. Maybe it’s a virtual school or other learning environments,” Morrisey said.
The Senate unanimously signed off the bill, and the House passed the measure with a 94-3 vote.
Three Democrats in the House opposed the measure, citing concerns about potentially unqualified counselors or social workers conducting an assessment to determine the underlying cause of a child’s behavior.
The bill doesn’t come with funding for schools to add behavioral support staff; some teachers told lawmakers that money and additional staff were key parts of addressing the problem. 
Lawmakers also passed a bill permitting counties to ban cell phones in classrooms, which was a request from Morrisey. The session ended without any movement on teacher pay raises; West Virginia teachers are the lowest paid in the nation.
“We know a lot more needs to be done,” Morrisey said. “Reversing courses is a major priority for my administration… I’m going to do whatever it takes to make sure West Virginia kids excel.”
